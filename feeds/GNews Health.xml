			&lt;p&gt;It starts with a slight scratchiness at the back of your throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then coughing, sniffling, and full-on congestion, with or without  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, for a few insufferable days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral upper respiratory tract infections – also known as the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold"&gt;common cold&lt;/a&gt; – afflict everyone, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4357298/"&gt;typically three times per year&lt;/a&gt;, lasting, on average, nine days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rinsing-your-nasal-passages-with-the-wrong-kind-of-water-could-be-deadly"&gt;Rinsing Your Nasal Passages With The Wrong Kind of Water Could Be Deadly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colds don't respond to antibiotics, and most &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2018.39.4117"&gt;over-the-counter medications deliver modest results&lt;/a&gt; at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, research has emerged demonstrating the effectiveness of the ancient practice of &lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/nasal-irrigation/"&gt;nasal saline irrigation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.12.022"&gt;fighting the common cold&lt;/a&gt; in both adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does nasal saline irrigation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;decrease the duration of illness&lt;/a&gt;, it also reduces viral transmission to other people, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y"&gt;minimizes the need for antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, and could even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044"&gt;lower a patient's risk of hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;. Better yet, it costs pennies and doesn't require a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm both an &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5st0T8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;adjunct assistant professor of medicine&lt;/a&gt; and a practicing physician. As a family doctor, I see the common cold every day. My patients are usually skeptical when I first recommend nasal saline irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they frequently return to tell me that this practice has changed their life. Not only does it help with upper respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, but it also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;helps manage allergies&lt;/a&gt;, chronic congestion, postnasal drip, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654"&gt;recurrent sinus infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is nasal saline irrigation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal saline irrigation is a process by which the nasal cavity is bathed in a saltwater solution. In some studies, this is accomplished using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;pump-action spray bottle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In others, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044"&gt;participants used&lt;/a&gt; a traditional &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/multimedia/neti-pot/img-20008137"&gt;neti pot&lt;/a&gt;, which is a vessel resembling a teapot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181747" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642.jpg" alt="neti pot" class="size-full wp-image-181747" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181747" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ceramic neti pot. (Betka82/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neti pot can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S002221512100030X"&gt;traced back to the 15th century&lt;/a&gt;. It garnered mainstream interest in the US in 2012 after Dr. Oz &lt;a href="https://www.oprah.com/health/your-questions-answered/5"&gt;demonstrated it on the "Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not the only device that has historically been employed for such purposes. Ancient Greek and Roman physicians &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S002221512100030X"&gt;had their own nasal lavage devices&lt;/a&gt;. Such practices were even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)83808-3"&gt;discussed in medical journals&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; over a century ago, in 1902.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does nasal saline irrigation work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal saline has a few key benefits. First, it physically flushes debris out of the nasal passage. This not only includes mucus and crust, but also the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; itself, along with allergens and other environmental contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, salt water is slightly lower on the &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/ph-scale-0"&gt;pH scale&lt;/a&gt; compared with fresh water. Its acidity creates an environment that is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2640010/"&gt;inhospitable for viruses&lt;/a&gt; and makes it harder for them to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, nasal saline helps restore the actions of part of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;our natural defense system&lt;/a&gt;, which is composed of microscopic, hairlike projections called &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cilium"&gt;cilia&lt;/a&gt; that line the surface of the nasal passage. These cilia beat in a coordinated fashion to act like an escalator, propelling viruses and other foreign particles out of the body. Nasal saline irrigation helps keep this system running effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of more than 11,000 people published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in 2024 demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation, initiated at the first sign of symptoms and performed up to six times per day, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;reduced the duration of symptomatic illness&lt;/a&gt; by approximately two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, smaller studies have reported that the reduced duration of illness could be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y"&gt;as high as four days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation can help prevent the spread of illness. A study in hospitalized patients showed that after detection of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; via nasal swab, nasal saline irrigation performed every four hours over a 16-hour period &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y"&gt;decreased COVID-19 viral load by 8.9%&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the viral load in the control group continued to increase during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181710" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642.jpg" alt="covid virus" class="size-full wp-image-181710" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181710" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nasal saline irrigation can decrease COVID-19 viral load. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD6DPSwa6k/"&gt;mapo/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of nasal saline also extend beyond acute infectious illnesses. When performed regularly by patients with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever"&gt;allergic rhinitis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as hay fever, a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 10 randomized controlled trials showed that nasal saline irrigation can enable a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;62% reduction in the use of allergy medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also effective for chronic congestion, postnasal drip, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654"&gt;recurrent sinus infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping patients feel better faster, one of the most valuable benefits of nasal saline irrigation is that its use can help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;decrease unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;, which are a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis509"&gt;major contributor to antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well established that antibiotics &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08758-y"&gt;do not shorten the duration or reduce the severity&lt;/a&gt; of respiratory tract infections. Despite this, studies have shown that patients are happier when they leave their doctor's office &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00522.x"&gt;with an antibiotic prescription in hand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be why &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-1337"&gt;10 million inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; are given each year for viral respiratory tract infections. In one study of more than 49,000 patient encounters for respiratory infections, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac302"&gt;antibiotics were unnecessarily prescribed&lt;/a&gt; to 42.4% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason patients with upper respiratory viral infections tend to initially feel better with antibiotics is because of their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2801304/"&gt;off-target, anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;. However, this benefit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.925"&gt;can be better achieved with anti-inflammatory medications&lt;/a&gt; such as ibuprofen or naproxen, which can be taken in conjunction with nasal saline irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, nasal saline irrigation is a cheap, effective, evidence-based alternative that will not only shorten the duration of illness but also prevent its spread, minimize the need for unnecessary antibiotics, and keep people out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who want to try it, you don't need anything fancy. Even a neti pot is not necessary. Many pharmacies sell salt water in a container with a nozzle and even spray bottles that can be refilled with a homemade saltwater solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll mix approximately half a teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 1 cup of water. It's important for your safety that the water be either distilled water or boiled for at least five minutes and then cooled to destroy any harmful bacteria. You can also add a pinch of baking soda to reduce any potential sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that saltier solutions are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044"&gt;not more effective&lt;/a&gt;. However, some studies have suggested that natural seawater, due to its additional minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and calcium, could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2015.08.001"&gt;offer even greater benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saltwater solutions can also be purchased commercially, which might be worth a try for those with an insufficient response to saline alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use nasal saline irrigation after any potential exposure to an infectious illness. For best results, you'll want to start irrigating the nasal passage at the first sign of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can repeat rinses throughout the day as often as needed for the duration of the illness. At a minimum, you'll want to irrigate the nasal passages every morning and evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also consider gargling salt water as an adjunctive therapy.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266659/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A hidden physical change in the body may be helping to drive the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/revealed-women-face-much-higher-risk-of-long-covid-but-why"&gt;prolonged malaise&lt;/a&gt; some people experience after contracting  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181528" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing blood samples from patients with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/life-with-long-covid-comparable-to-parkinsons-and-stroke"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, a team of medical researchers has identified unusual microscopic structures that may contribute to symptoms such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covids-hidden-toll-full-body-scans-reveal-long-term-immune-effects"&gt;brain fog and fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. If this is the case, it offers a hopeful target for future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;the team writes in a paper&lt;/a&gt; led by geneticist Alain Thierry of Montpellier University in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-just-got-more-evidence-that-long-covid-is-a-brain-injury"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Just Got More Evidence That Long COVID Is a Brain Injury&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why some people experience symptoms for months to years after a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181528" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; infection is still &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-true-extent-of-long-covid-is-still-emerging-but-heres-what-we-know"&gt;something of a medical mystery&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-causes-long-covid-three-leading-theories"&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; may be at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility first raised by physiologist Resia Pretorius of Stellenbosch University in South Africa &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01359-7"&gt;in 2021 is microclots&lt;/a&gt;. These are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/BCJ20220016"&gt;tiny&lt;/a&gt;, abnormally persistent blood clots that are smaller than those seen in conditions such as stroke or thrombosis, yet large enough to hinder blood flow through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"&gt;capillaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in 2022, Thierry and his colleagues showed that patients with long COVID have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.28209"&gt;elevated levels&lt;/a&gt; of neutrophil extracellular traps, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_extracellular_traps"&gt;NETs&lt;/a&gt;. These are sticky webs of DNA and enzymes released by white blood cells to capture and contain pathogens invading the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, NETs do their job and then quickly break down, but when they are released in large numbers or persist longer than needed, they can contribute to blood flow problems &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312463"&gt;such as thrombosis and atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research – a collaboration between Pretorius and Thierry – suggests that these two separate markers, NETs and microclots, may interact in the blood of long COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181535" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-181535" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot-600x363.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181535" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A long COVID patient's microclot. The green areas are abnormal sticky proteins, while the red and blue parts are cellular material. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1100665"&gt;Dr Chantelle Venter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used &lt;a href="https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/nanomaterials/capabilities/cytometry-and-particle-characterisation/imaging-flow-cytometry"&gt;imaging flow cytometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"&gt;fluorescence microscopy&lt;/a&gt; to study blood samples from 50 patients with long COVID and 38 healthy volunteers, focusing specifically on any differences in microclots and NETs. The healthy individuals had been recruited in two separate cohorts, in France and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with long COVID, the analysis revealed, had a dramatically higher number of microclots than the healthy controls – a 19.7-fold increase on the median. These clots were also larger than the microclots seen in healthy blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in NETs also correlated with the rise in microclots in long COVID patients. But then the researchers found something new: The NETs appeared to be physically embedded within the microclots, an association that had never before been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, t&lt;/span&gt;his association was observed in all the samples, both from the long COVID patients and control groups, which makes sense because the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81268-7"&gt;NETs' sticky mesh facilitates clotting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the effect was much more pronounced in the long COVID group. This interaction could make the microclots more resistant to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"&gt;fibrinolysis process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the body uses to break up accumulations of blood material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic," &lt;a href="https://www.su.ac.za/en/faculties/science/news/scientists-reveal-another-piece-long-covid-puzzle"&gt;Thierry explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So dramatic was the difference that, when the samples were anonymized, an AI agent was able to identify the long COVID patients with 91 percent accuracy. This suggests that microclots and NETs may be a biomarker that doctors could use to diagnose long COVID, a condition that has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/long-covid-is-likely-going-to-be-with-us-for-a-while-here-s-the-latest-theories"&gt;proven slippery&lt;/a&gt; to pin down &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25111-long-covid"&gt;using standard tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is still early research; more work needs to be done to establish a causal relationship between microclots, NETs, and long COVID. But if researchers can figure out how these blood components affect long COVID, it may be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-pain-treatment-may-offer-hope-for-long-covid-sufferers"&gt;step towards relief&lt;/a&gt; for those living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue fever are good examples, because they only proliferate in areas where the temperature and rainfall are beneficial for the mosquito population to grow, as well as for the disease itself to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, as the Earth heats up due to air pollution, more and more of the world fits those conditions — and dengue fever is already becoming a more widespread problem, as a new study covered by the Stanford Report &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:revealed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Arizona State University, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was published in September in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers examined how much the Earth's rising temperature will increase cases of dengue fever in the future — and how much it already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The effects of temperature were much larger than I expected," said lead author Marissa Childs, an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of Washington, per the &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stanford Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt;. "Even small shifts in temperature can have a big impact for dengue transmission, and we're already seeing the fingerprint of climate warming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So exactly how large was that fingerprint? After examining 1.4 million cases of the disease across 21 countries, researchers determined that climate change is responsible for an additional 4.6 million infections each year, representing an 18% increase in the disease's incidence. By 2050, the rate could climb another 49% to 76%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this result important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dengue fever, also called "breakbone fever," is a painful and potentially serious illness. In severe cases, it can cause debilitating pain and can lead to death. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, those who contract it more than once are at greater risk of experiencing a severe case. And as the world heats up, more and more people who have never been exposed to this illness before are now at risk — a fact which has already had a death toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is not just hypothetical future change but a large amount of human suffering that has already happened because of warming-driven dengue transmission," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author Erin Mordecai, a professor of biology from the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, per the Stanford Report. "Climate change is not just affecting the weather — it has cascading consequences for human health, including fueling disease transmission by mosquitoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about dengue fever transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research into vaccinations has yielded results that promise to reduce the spread of dengue fever worldwide. Some local governments are also working on directly controlling the mosquito population to thereby stop the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the only long-term solution for the broader problem of diseases that spread more rapidly in warmer temperatures is to reduce the Earth's temperature by reducing air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec9bh39sND8fgERx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUndCb3VRRFRaSl9UTW5OTWtwTndjRHN6RWVEbFpwbnlPcUF0ZGNiTjJLbnhLcTNGdnlJOVpCMy1CVGlKZzdGVFBmT201d3RLaTNkODNLaGpTcF9BSEY2NUJaSEU5ZmhvcnY2UjdJRGxrRzA4clhwWGUzQnA4d2FCM0k2QjFzNG5IdUJHeWJDZDdXdw</guid></item><item><title>我播出的“脑雾”时刻如何引发了一场大辩论- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;How my on-air 'brain fog' moment sparked a big debate&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 xGeVU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 djOqvY"&gt;Zoe Kleinman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-8 gvcwmG"&gt;Technology editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman holding notes as she speaks on the BBC News at Ten" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Due to "brain fog" BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman had to hold notes during a recent live TV report&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When I rather nervously shared a personal post about dealing with brain fog at work on the social network LinkedIn last week, I had no idea that it would have such an enormous impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393223331946332160/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;viewed&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of thousands of times.

But of course it can also hit mid-conversation, in a more intimate but no less frustrating way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;My post was about my decision to hold a page of notes on the BBC News at Ten. A story had broken late in the afternoon, following an already busy day, and by the time we reached 10pm, I knew I was getting tired and I could feel the brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was going to talk about an outage that was affecting dozens of websites and apps, and I planned to use the technical jargon for it, as given by the company affected, and then explain what it actually meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But I just couldn't get the phrase to stick in my head and I knew that without it, I wouldn't manage the rest of what I needed to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was reporting live from Glasgow. Like many of my professional peers, I do not have, and I've never had, autocue. And so, for the first time, I decided at the last minute to hold a page of notes with the offending phrase on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It felt to me at the time like an admission of failure. I have been trained never to use notes – unless there's a specific legal reason why the wording of a statement, for example, has to be precise, or there are a lot of figures to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even then, I have prided myself on having a good enough short-term memory to get me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Using notes is discouraged in the world of public speaking. They are not permitted to anyone giving a 12-minute TED talk. The speaker is expected to memorise their speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking down the barrel of the camera and clutching that paper, live on TV, felt tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But around 10% of women report &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/menopauseandtheworkplace" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;leaving their jobs&lt;/a&gt; due to menopause symptoms, according to the Fawcett Society. And research by insurance firm Royal London found that half of women going through it have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.royallondon.com/about-us/media/Media-Centre/press-releases/press-releases-2023/october/Menopause-talent-drain-half-of-women-going-through-menopause-are-considering-leaving-work/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;considered giving up work.&lt;/a&gt; I don't want to do that – and so I stuck with my solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To my intense relief, some people said they thought my paper looked authoritative, that they just assumed it was a breaking story and the page contained fresh information. Others asked why I hadn't used a device instead – I suppose I thought the potential of having to fumble with a screen would feel even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Let's start a movement: Hold your notes," wrote Elisheva Marcus, vice president of communications at the venture capitalist firm Earlybird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And so, the hashtag holdthenotes was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Have you ever checked your testosterone levels?" menopause expert Dr Louise Newson asked me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says testosterone – despite its reputation for being a male hormone, and its association with sex drive and libido, is actually an essential brain chemical for both men and women, and levels fall in both genders.

Dr. Love points out that alcohol alters how the brain communicates, altering learning, memory, and decision-making. Chronic heavy drinking can even shrink the brain tissue itself and distort neurotransmitter balance, impeding neurons from communicating as they should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcohol also disrupts sleep quality, even though it may get you to sleep quicker, and disrupted sleep amplifies the toxic effect on the brain. Chronic alcohol consumption raises the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and, in severe cases, can result in permanent cognitive impairment. According to Dr. Love, if you can cut down or practice mindful drinking, you can spare your brain from further damage. For people who struggle with alcohol addiction, professional intervention can be life-changing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>家中的5项NASA日常发明和电子产品- bgr.com</title><link>https://www.bgr.com/2022720/everyday-technology-gadgets-nasa-inventions/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In 1958, during the height of the Cold War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed what was known as the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law. The goal of the legislation was to create an agency dedicated to civilian space exploration and aeronautics research, and from it NASA was formed. The agency been making &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1984386/nasa-voyager-1-discovery-wall-of-fire/" target="_blank"&gt;stunning solar system discoveries&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its logo evokes imagery of rockets lifting toward space and astronauts spacewalking against starry backdrops. But NASA's research and development efforts have also produced technology we use on a daily basis. The demands of space exploration have tasked NASA with finding solutions to problems that don't necessarily exist anywhere else. Equipment must be lightweight but durable, compact but powerful, and capable of functioning reliably in extreme conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when solving these problems, NASA engineers create technologies with applications right here on Earth. Devices that help us keep the house clean, tools that ensure the safety of our loved ones, and even our beloved selfie cameras all have NASA's fingerprints on them. NASA classics like freeze-dried ice cream may not currently grace your pantry shelves, but the American space program's influence can be found in plenty of devices elsewhere around the house. Let's explore some of the NASA inventions we use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to collect lunar samples from the moon's surface, NASA realized during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and early 1970s that it would need to develop portable, battery-powered tools. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center partnered with Black &amp;amp; Decker to develop a specialized drill that could operate in zero gravity while maintaining the proper amount of power during an extended runtime. The company's engineers created a computer program capable of optimizing the motor's design, ensuring maximum power output with minimal drain on the drill's power source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drill that was developed would go on to lay the foundation for Black &amp;amp; Decker's consumer product lineup. In January of 1979 the company introduced the Dustbuster, the popular handheld vacuum that worked cordlessly to clean stairs, sofas, and hard-to-reach places. The success of the Dustbuster was due in large part to the convenience it provided while keeping the house clean, and over the years that concept has been taken to greater heights. Companies like Dyson and Shark are known for their more sophisticated, full-size cordless vacuums, and the influence of those NASA Apollo missions can even be seen in devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/tech/are-roomba-robot-vacuums-still-worth-it/" target="_blank"&gt;Roomba and other robot vacuum options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While the smoke detector dates all the way back to 1890, it's a good example of a piece of technology NASA improved upon greatly for its own use. In the 1970s NASA partnered with Honeywell Corporation to develop an adjustable smoke detection system for Skylab, the first American space station. With astronauts unable to evacuate to safety in the event of a fire, NASA needed a device reliable enough to warn crews of smoke and toxic gases, yet sophisticated enough not to be triggered by the routine activities going on at Skylab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting NASA invention was an ionization smoke detector with adjustable sensitivity, which influenced the evolution of home detectors over the years that followed. Honeywell would go on to release a battery backup smoke detector with a self-recharging battery, which became one of the most sophisticated alarm systems available for residential use. To this day, many home smoke detectors use ionization technology similar to what NASA developed.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When you're exploring the unknown, bringing back pictures is imperative, like &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/nasa-just-snapped-the-closest-photos-of-the-sun-ever-taken/" target="_blank"&gt;NASA's recent close-up photos of the sun&lt;/a&gt;. Early space cameras were large, power-hungry devices that took up a lot of room aboard NASA spacecraft. Photographic equipment would need to be implemented into satellites as well, and by the 1990s, NASA was set on improving image sensors for a new generation of space exploration. The culmination of that research was CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology developed by a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key innovation within CMOS technology was the active-pixel sensor. It was capable of boosting image quality while requiring 100 times less power than the then-standard CCD sensor. While the CMOS sensor was immediately beneficial for NASA, it has become transformational for the rest of us, with far more than a billion cameras utilizing CMOS technology manufactured since. CMOS sensors can be found in everything from professional video cameras to vehicle backup cameras, and from the main camera of popular smartphones to the front-facing selfie camera that allows you to video chat with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While working on a water purification system for spacecraft at the Ames Research Center, NASA's Dr. Ted Wydeven inadvertently discovered the foundation for scratch-resistant plastic lenses. NASA expanded on the discovery to develop an abrasion-resistant coating for astronaut helmets and the plastic surfaces of other space equipment. Meanwhile, eyeglass manufacturers were making a switch to plastic lenses, and in 1983 a company called Foster-Grant obtained a license from NASA to combine its decade of scratch-resistance research with NASA's scratch-resistant coating technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting lenses lasted 10 times longer than standard plastic lenses and even surpassed glass in terms of durability. Today, scratch-resistance technology can be found in everything from ski goggles to sunglasses, and if tech like &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1992030/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-repairability-ifixit-teardown/" target="_blank"&gt;Meta's expensive smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; ever become popular among the masses, it's likely we'll see scratch-resistance incorporated into them as well. What began as a NASA invention to protect astronauts and their equipment from the harshness of space now provides us with protection on our smartphone screens, camera lenses, and other optical equipment in addition to eyewear.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order for astronauts to control spacecraft and equipment while wearing bulky spacesuits, NASA engineers developed joystick technology. Apollo spacecraft used a special joystick with buttons on the hilt. Known as the "picklestick," the joystick sent electrical signals to the Apollo Guidance Computer to give astronauts control of the spacecraft's trajectory. The technology evolved through NASA's programs, and the United States military uses the picklestick and a digital fly-by-wire system in many of its fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to everyday use around the house, joysticks are probably most recognized in the gaming world. They were popularized in the early 1980s on home console controllers, and today joysticks are standard in video game controllers across platforms. Dual joystick controllers allow for the control of characters as well as in-game cameras, and devices like drones utilize joysticks for control as well. The joystick has even evolved into a digital existence, with many mobile games and apps using touch-based controls designed to emulate a joystick.&lt;/p&gt;

While the diet is known for preventing weight gain and improving short-term metabolic markers, the research shows that long-term keto eating may trigger hidden biological changes that disrupt how the body processes fats and sugars. Conducted over many months in mice, the study challenges the widely held belief that extended keto dieting is harmless, revealing metabolic side effects that could carry significant health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The hidden trade-offs of long-term keto diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet forces the body into ketosis by drastically cutting carbohydrates and increasing fat intake. In this state, the liver produces ketone bodies to fuel the brain and stabilise energy levels. Originally used as a medical therapy for epilepsy, the diet has since grown into a mainstream weight-loss strategy celebrated for quick results and improved blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Importance of balanced diet for health and wellbeing | Exploring life's every dimension&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new University of Utah Health study suggests that the long-term metabolic consequences of the ketogenic diet may be far more complex than previously understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed how prolonged adherence to a high-fat, very low-carbohydrate eating pattern affects the body over extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that, even when the diet helps prevent excessive weight gain and maintains a leaner body profile, it may simultaneously place significant strain on key metabolic systems. Over time, this heavy reliance on dietary fat appears to alter the body’s ability to manage lipids and regulate blood sugar, revealing hidden vulnerabilities that could undermine long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body struggled to manage the constant influx of dietary fat, leading to elevated fat levels in the blood and changes in liver function. These shifts hinted at an underlying biological cost that is not immediately apparent during short-term dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keto linked to fatty liver disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most concerning discoveries was the rapid development of fatty liver disease in male mice consuming the ketogenic diet. Fatty liver is a major warning sign of broader metabolic dysfunction and a risk factor for diabetes and heart disease. Interestingly, female mice did not show the same degree of liver fat accumulation, highlighting sex-specific differences that researchers plan to explore in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to senior author Amandine Chaix, PhD, the liver becomes overwhelmed by the high-fat load, forcing excess fat to build up within liver cells. Over time, this compromises liver function and sets the stage for metabolic disease, despite the mice not gaining significant body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight loss that hides deeper issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the ketogenic diet prevented weight gain in both male and female mice, it did not eliminate deeper metabolic problems. The appearance of lower body weight masked underlying disruptions in glucose regulation and insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two to three months on the diet, keto-fed mice had unusually low levels of both glucose and insulin when fasting. But when they were given even a small amount of carbohydrates, their blood sugar spiked dramatically and remained elevated for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Molly Gallop, PhD, explained that this indicates an impaired ability to regulate blood sugar. Despite appearing metabolically stable at rest, the mice struggled to handle carbohydrates — a dangerous sign of metabolic inflexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress inside the pancreas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, were under severe stress. High-fat exposure disrupted how these cells transported and processed proteins, leaving them unable to respond properly when glucose levels rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cellular stress likely caused the impaired insulin secretion and unstable blood glucose seen in the mice. Notably, some of these issues reversed once the animals were removed from the ketogenic diet, suggesting that not all effects are permanent — but they are still cause for caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implications for human keto dieters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mice are not humans, the study raises red flags about the long-term metabolic safety of ketogenic diets. Most human studies focus on short-term outcomes such as weight loss or improved glucose control, while long-term biological effects remain largely understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight that a diet high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrates may strain key organs such as the liver and pancreas if followed for extended periods. They also raise questions about how sex, genetics and lifestyle may influence individual responses to keto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Utah Health study offers an important reminder: while keto can produce impressive short-term results, it is not without risks. Long-term keto eating may trigger hidden metabolic side effects, including fatty liver, impaired blood sugar regulation and cellular stress in key organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists work to better understand the full spectrum of ketogenic diet effects, one message is clear — the diet’s benefits come with trade-offs, and long-term safety is far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 21:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxOUnVqcHBaRHFlMUJra0FZYnhBakUxX1pCVXpELXJWTFdUcjdkRGxJUUdIYThSTURvMWlmQjliV0Q0S3RLQkRBNTNQUVB1aUtIUHJaWFhtYldHaE5PSHM1dk5XbmFhdmNXN2FXdUxqRHVraU5fa3FDUVptSDAydUpxZUhpUlNxZFR4NXJaZWdIeDJ2eEJGeFcxUHNSS3RMYlhneTc0QjlUYVhwcUZZeDFMcDFrekR6NGdqWXktSEdnVVdkMEV2VW9TVFF6OHR1eF82bWFhMU9xSEVjOEhnZ2pRcDVvNl9sMjF6dUhkYlpmOHEycWVONmQ4UUZCZ0ZWb0VERlVhNEZIZ2VTX0po</guid></item><item><title>4岁男孩被诊断患有儿童痴呆症： “我永远不会听到他的声音” - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/4-old-boy-diagnosed-childhood-210000255.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Tate was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tammy McDaid is raising money to secure experimental treatment for her son, Tate, who has a rare and devastating genetic disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanfilippo Syndrome, often called childhood dementia, causes developmental regression and premature death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My little boy has never spoken a word,” McDaid said, “and now I know I will never get to hear his voice"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.K. mom is racing against the clock to get her son, 4, accepted in a clinical trial to fight his rare, degenerative form of childhood dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next year is quite critical in Tate's life as it's around now that things start to show,” Tammy McDaid told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn20jg3xwo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; about her son, Tate. He was initially diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://people.com/bill-gates-says-he-would-be-diagnosed-with-autism-if-he-were-a-kid-today-8780432" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; at age 2, but as his mom, who hails from Swansea, Wales, said, "Deep down I always suspected there was something more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MRI scan in March 2024 showed spaces in Tate's brain that were indicative of dementia, and further testing led to the diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://people.com/her-belly-was-hard-her-diapers-always-full-why-her-mom-knew-something-was-wrong-despite-doctors-dismissals-exclusive-11755313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sanfilippo Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sanfilippo Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.

As McDaid wrote in the &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-give-my-little-boy-a-fighting-chance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; established to pay for his care, “My little boy has never spoken a word, and now I know I will never get to hear his voice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money McDaid is raising is intended “to explore any possible treatment options abroad,” she wrote. ”These potential trials or therapies could give him more time being mobile &amp;amp; eating food! More days filled with climbing, running, and me living on edge to see where he will escape to next! - but they will be extremely expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s any chance to help him, I have to take it,” McDaid wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she knows there isn’t a cure, McDaid is hoping to “slow down the regression of [Tate's] mobility, as that is what is going to hit me the hardest," she told the BBC. "He could climb before he could walk. I just want him to be able to do this for as long as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am so blessed and proud of him.

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 390 to 452 calories while the lunches span 429 to 673 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is an anti-inflammatory diet?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory diet focuses on eating foods high in antioxidants like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and beans, as well as healthy fats such as extra virgin olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, walnuts and flaxseeds. It limits consuming foods that may promote inflammation, such as ultra-processed foods and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_173-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial to our bodies, like acute inflammation that happens when you are recovering from an injury or infection. However, chronic inflammation is a low-grade, more long-term type of inflammation that is harder to notice and can lead to some negative health implications like higher chronic disease risk. Fortunately, eating an anti-inflammatory diet can help remedy some of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that go with chronic inflammation, like joint pain, brain fog and low energy levels.

It helps keep you regular and also supports a healthy gut microbiome, which has been linked with improved immune function, better heart health, reduced risk of cognitive decline and more. Eating enough fiber not only benefits your gut, but additionally can help reduce inflammation. Research shows that higher fiber intake may lower inflammation markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

She's authored books and spoken publicly about the issue and subsequent decline in fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, when Dr Swan saw that her research had been cited by Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-073860b0-b503-11f0-8458-b7d1037117f2" class=""&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; in the days after his comments on October 16, she was thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15202593/American-men-lower-sperm-count-RFK-Jr.html"&gt;RFK Jr said at a press briefing&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span&gt;'Today, the average teenager in this country has 50 percent of the sperm count, 50 percent of the testosterone, as a 65-year-old man.'  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was not clear whether RFK Jr was comparing teenagers today to 65-year-olds today or when 65-year-olds were teenagers themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the comments, an HHS spokesman told Daily Mail that RFK Jr's comments were based on Dr Swan's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689"&gt;2017 paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Swan told the Daily Mail: 'I am glad that sperm decline is getting some attention... and, you know, I am concerned about &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fertility/index.html" id="mol-0745ce30-b503-11f0-8458-b7d1037117f2" class=""&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been doing this research since the late 1990s... so, I am happy to see when anybody, particularly people in authority, recognize that this is a problem.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Shanna Swan, the expert behind the most influential sperm studies, is pictured above at a gala in Los Angeles on October 29, 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Swan was the co-author on the  &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; that first warned of the 'spermageddon' crisis that researchers say could upend men's fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing data from 1973 to 2011, the team found that sperm counts had plummeted 52 percent on average during that period, leaving fewer sperm available to fertilize an egg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's one of the leading culprits behind &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15047185/ultraprocessed-food-sex-drive.html"&gt;rising cases of male infertility&lt;/a&gt; and researchers blame sedentary lifestyles, higher obesity rates and toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, the US total fertility rate has also declined, dropping from 2.52 births per woman in 1970 to 1.62 in 2023, the latest date available, although experts link this to other factors like increased focus on career and concerns over costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And other papers have since suggested that sperm counts are not falling by the same magnitude, although they say there also appears to be a modest decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The HHS spokesman also cited a separate &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false"&gt;follow-up 2022 meta-analysis &lt;/a&gt;by Dr Swan that led her to warn sperm counts could reach zero, on average, by 2045, forcing couples to seek fertility treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Swan said she was not contacted by HHS for details on her research, although she was pleased to hear it was being cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she said it was not entirely accurate, based on her work, to say that the sperm counts of teenage boys today are half of those of 65-year-old men alive today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researcher said that what RFK Jr likely meant was that teenagers today have 50 percent lower sperm counts, as well as lower testosterone, today than today's 65-year-olds did when they were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of a pregnant woman with her partner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testosterone and sperm counts are linked. Doctors say that higher levels of the hormone drive the body to produce more sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Swan said: 'I don't take issue [with RFK Jr's comments].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overall... sperm counts have declined by about one percent a year since about 1973, and, if you look more recently, from 2000, then the rate of decline has increased quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, what we are seeing is an increasing rate of decline; they're declining faster in recent years. It looks like testosterone levels are declining too.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning over the risks posed by falling sperm counts, she said: 'A while ago there was a Danish study that looked at chances of conceiving and how long it would take to get pregnant if sperm count was at a certain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What it showed very dramatically was when sperm got to about 40 million [sperm per milliliter of semen], chances dropped off very fast, down to zero. So, zero sperm, of course, your chance of getting pregnant is zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But that chance climbs up, and when it gets to about 75 million [sperm per milliliter of semen], it levels off, and then it's all good. It doesn't matter if it's 75 or 150 million. It does the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But now, we're getting closer to that point where it's definitely taking longer to get pregnant. Not impossible, but taking longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an interview with&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/28/shanna-swan-fertility-reproduction-count-down"&gt; The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, Dr Swan warned that sperm counts may be so low that 'most couples may have to use assisted reproduction by 2045.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr with Donald Trump at the press conference in October, where he warned about the decline in sperm and testosterone levels in men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of low testosterone include low sex drive, fatigue, decreased muscle mass, depression, and weak bones, among others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other researchers, however, have previously raised concerns over Dr Swan's research, saying that doctors can find it difficult to accurately count sperm in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say the factors driving a reduction in sperm counts and testosterone are broadly similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both are affected by poor diets, obesity, environmental hazards like chemicals and a lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028224019538"&gt;One paper published this year &lt;/a&gt;by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western University suggested sperm counts had dropped by about 0.35 million sperm per milliliter of semen every year globally between 1970 and 2018, when results were adjusted for region and fertility status, in what the researchers called a 'modest annual decline'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unadjusted results from the same paper, however, estimated that sperm counts had remained level in the US between 1970 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers behind the study said that they did not believe that even a modest decline was likely to lead to a rise in infertility rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paper suggested that the average sperm count was currently around 78 million sperm per milliliter of semen in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was well above the threshold where doctors say a man would be considered infertile, at about 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and within the World Health Organization's estimate of a healthy sperm count, between 15 and 250 million sperm per milliliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Testosterone levels peak in young adulthood, around age 20, but decline by about one percent annually after age 30. This data is from a University of Wisconsin study &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about nine percent of men in the US are infertile. For a man to be diagnosed with infertility, it means he has a low sperm count or sperm that is not of sufficient quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the number of men experiencing infertility has risen 76 percent since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among women, 13.4 percent are infertile in the US, according to the CDC. Researchers at &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2022/06/us-infertility-rate-plateaus"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; say this level has remained largely unchanged in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, about one in six couples in the US struggle to conceive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jeff Singer, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in the Department of Health Policy Studies, previously told the Daily Mail: 'What I can say is that Secretary Kennedy has taken a couple of real studies and turned them into a sensational sound bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's some evidence of modest downward trends across generations, likely tied to lifestyle and health factors, but nothing close to Kennedy's doomsday framing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'His claim badly distorts the data, confusing normal aging with supposed generational collapse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America's fertility rate has been in decline since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latest data showed the rate was 54.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years in 2023, a three percent decrease from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of babies born in the US declined to 3.6 million births registered in 2023, the latest year available, down two percent from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the US is heading for an 'underpopulation crisis' by 2050, when too few people are born to support its current economic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that if birth rates continue at their current rate, the natural-born population of the US could be extinct in just 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;I used to think happiness after 50 was about having things figured out. Like there was some magical wisdom download that happened when you hit middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it's less about having answers and more about having practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people I know who seem genuinely content in their fifties and beyond aren't necessarily the ones who made all the right choices or avoided hardship. They're the ones who showed up for themselves in small, consistent ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to walk through seven daily rituals that these folks tend to share. Nothing groundbreaking. Nothing that requires a complete life overhaul. Just simple practices that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) They move their bodies without obsessing over it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I've noticed about the happiest people over 50: they've stopped treating exercise like punishment for existing in a body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is 72 and walks to the food bank every Saturday morning where she volunteers. Not because she's trying to hit 10,000 steps or burn calories, but because she likes the ritual of it. The movement is just part of the activity she loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the pattern I keep seeing. Movement becomes something you do because it feels good, not because you're trying to fix something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's a morning stretch routine. Maybe it's gardening. Maybe it's dancing in the kitchen while cooking dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it's integrated into life rather than being this separate thing you have to force yourself to do. There's no guilt when you skip a day, and no medal-chasing when you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body at 50 is different than it was at 30, and the people who stay happy seem to have made peace with that reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) They've learned to say no without explaining themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one took me way too long to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I said yes to everything. Every social obligation, every work project, every favor asked of me. And then I'd resent the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy 50-somethings I know have mastered the art of the simple no. No elaborate justification. No fake excuses. Just "that doesn't work for me" or "I'm not available."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds easy, but it requires you to get comfortable with other people being disappointed in you. Which, as Rudá Iandê writes in "Laughing in the Face of Chaos," "Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life's challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned this book before, but his insights about letting go of people-pleasing really shifted something for me. The book inspired me to start viewing my time as actually finite rather than just theoretically finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're in your twenties, you can kind of pretend you have unlimited energy and time. By 50, that illusion is harder to maintain. The people who stay happy seem to have accepted this and adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) They maintain friendships that feel effortless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of them. Not even most of them. But a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genuinely happy older folks I know have stopped trying to maintain friendships that feel like work. They've let some relationships fade, and they've stopped feeling guilty about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they've kept are the connections that feel easy. The friend you can not talk to for six months and then pick up right where you left off. The person who doesn't need you to perform or pretend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner is 43, and watching him navigate friendships has taught me something important. He has maybe three or four people he actually stays in close contact with. But those relationships are deep. There's no small talk, no catching up for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality over quantity becomes less of a cliché and more of a necessity as you age. You just don't have the bandwidth to maintain surface-level connections anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly? That's a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) They cook for themselves regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound boring, but hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest people over 50 I know tend to cook. Not elaborate Instagram-worthy meals necessarily, but real food that they actually enjoy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something grounding about feeding yourself well. It's a small act of self-respect that happens multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I make a big batch of lentil soup or spend Sunday afternoon prepping vegetables from the farmers market, I'm not just making food. I'm creating conditions for my future self to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay happy after 50 seem to have internalized this. They're not grabbing takeout every night or eating sad desk lunches. They're actually sitting down, even if just for 15 minutes, to eat something they prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be fancy. My grandmother's favorite meal is toast with mashed avocado and tomatoes. But she makes it herself, plates it nicely, and sits at her table to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That small ritual matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) They've developed a practice that isn't about productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography for me. Vinyl collecting. Reading fiction that has nothing to do with work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy people over 50 have something they do purely because it brings them joy, not because it's building toward anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is harder than it sounds in a culture that monetizes everything. We're trained to turn hobbies into side hustles, to optimize our leisure time, to make everything count toward some larger goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the people who maintain genuine happiness have protected at least one activity from that impulse. They have something they do just because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner brews kombucha on weekends. It's not for Instagram. He's not selling it. He just likes the process of experimenting with flavors and watching the fermentation happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked him why he does it, he just shrugged and said "because it's interesting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the whole reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) They've stopped arguing with reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the biggest difference I've noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who stay happy after 50 have largely given up on the "should" game. Things should be different. People should behave better. Life should be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've accepted that reality just is what it is, and arguing with it only creates suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my early thirties trying to convince people to go vegan through sheer force of moral argument. I had statistics, footage, all the ammunition I needed to prove I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was miserable. More importantly, I wasn't actually helping anyone change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until I stopped fighting reality, stopped insisting the world should already be the way I wanted it to be, that I actually became effective. And much, much happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy older folks I know have all arrived at some version of this acceptance. They're not passive or resigned. They still work toward things. But they've stopped exhausting themselves by arguing with what already is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) They get outside almost every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's just for ten minutes. Even if it's just to their balcony or front porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern is consistent: people who maintain happiness after 50 have some form of daily contact with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's research backing this up, of course. Nature exposure reduces stress, improves mood, all the things you'd expect. But I think it's more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting outside breaks the loop of your own thoughts. It reminds you that you're part of something larger than your immediate concerns and anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Venice Beach, and my favorite time of day is early morning when I walk down to the water with my coffee. Not to exercise. Not to be productive. Just to remember that the ocean was here before me and will be here after me, and that puts my deadline stress into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay genuinely happy seem to have found their version of this. Maybe it's tending a garden. Maybe it's sitting on a park bench. Maybe it's walking their dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific activity matters less than the regularity of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these rituals are revolutionary. You've probably heard versions of all of them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I've learned from watching people who actually stay happy after 50: it's not about knowing what to do. It's about actually doing it, consistently, without making it into a big dramatic thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't New Year's resolutions. They're just small choices, repeated daily, that compound into a life that feels good to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to implement all seven tomorrow. Pick one. See how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay happy after 50 didn't get there by overhauling their entire lives at once. They got there by showing up for themselves in small ways, over and over, until those ways became who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re creaky and they’re achy. They crackle when I sit down, and they hurt when I stand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/what-is-pain"&gt;pain’s&lt;/a&gt; not awful, so I get on with my daily life – but it puts me off running, which keeps me active as I get older. And every stiff stride is accompanied by the same worry: could I be developing osteoarthritis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not alone in this concern. Knee pain is remarkably common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="b093b748-5df6-48d8-bd48-a66c7267b8a9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;storefront-element type="section" ngh="10"&gt;&lt;storefront-section data-transfer-id="dd070cf1-fd01-458e-a195-55d971ac0db3" class="section-jw-player" ngh="12" jsaction="click:;"&gt;&lt;storefront-element type="html" ngh="5"&gt;&lt;storefront-html class ngh="4"&gt;&lt;p id="playerContainerJW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/storefront-html&gt;&lt;/storefront-element&gt;&lt;/storefront-section&gt;&lt;/storefront-element&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12923283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; found that half of those aged over 50 (my age bracket) had experienced knee pain in the previous year, and that a third had visited their doctor because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culprit? Osteoarthritis is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33364106/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most common cause&lt;/a&gt;. Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, with large, weight-bearing bones, such as the knees and the hips, most likely to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, it impacts &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 500 million people&lt;/a&gt;, causing pain and disability. But, despite being a common affliction, there are no drugs to slow its progression… yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, in the early stages, you can only guess whether your niggly joints are arthritic or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-x-ray.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="X-ray of the knees of a 55 year old patient with osteoarthritis in both knees. The narrowing of the space between the femur (thigh one, top) and tibia (shin bone, bottom) indicates osteoarthritis" class="wp-image-208503"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The narrow spaces between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone) in this 55-year-old patient’s legs indicate arthritis - Image credit: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because diagnosis, which involves symptom assessment, examination and sometimes imaging, tends to happen in the late stages of the disease, when much of the damage is already done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, osteoarthritis is thought to begin years, or perhaps even decades, before symptoms escalate and the joint degenerates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there’s a huge window of opportunity when the disease could be curtailed, if only there was a way to detect it earlier and stop it in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10477960/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;billion people projected&lt;/a&gt; to have osteoarthritis by 2050, better diagnostics and new therapies have never been more needed. But as our understanding of the disease improves, researchers are now tantalisingly close to reaching that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of progress being made,” says &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Gowler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Peter Gowler&lt;/a&gt;, research liaison manager at the charity Versus Arthritis, “yet osteoarthritis is very often dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new detection tests on the horizon, all that could be set to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common risk factors of arthritis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, when people visit their doctor with symptoms, like mine, that are painful but manageable, they get told that they probably have a ‘touch’ of arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But they wouldn’t say that for any other disease,” he says. People don’t talk about a ‘touch’ of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/the-discoveries-bringing-an-end-to-heart-attacks"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; or a ‘touch’ of multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, the doctor’s diagnosis is a well-meaning guess. Although clinicians know what osteoarthritis ‘looks’ like in its final stages when the cartilage is well worn, there’s currently no test that predicts the progression of early knee pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know there are things we can do to help prevent the disease. These include maintaining a healthy weight relative to your height and body type (ask your doctor if you are unsure what this means for you) and keeping active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27333572/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regular running&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to strengthen the knee joint and make osteoarthritis less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also know there are risk factors that make the disease more likely. These include being older, being female, being overweight and having had a previous joint injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I score three out of four here, but while this checklist tells me I’d be wise to adopt preventative measures, it still doesn’t tell me if I’m in the early stages of the disease or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mystery of early arthritis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the big problems we have is we don’t have a way of defining what early osteoarthritis is,” says Gowler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, the changes that occur inside the joint are subtle, but standard imaging methods, such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aren’t sensitive enough to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Aberdeen University, physicist &lt;a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/james.ross" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr James Ross&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues have been developing a new type of MRI, called Field-Cycling Imaging (FCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where traditional MRI uses a constant magnetic field to create images of the body, FCI can dial the strength of the magnetic field up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This allows us to see how different tissues respond to different magnetic fields, and see how their properties vary,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-Lionel-and-FCI-Scanner.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Photo of a person standing beside an FCI scanner" class="wp-image-208504"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dr Lionel Broche works with Ross on developing FCI scanners that can detect osteoarthritis early - Image credit: University of Aberdeen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team took cartilage samples from the knee joints of people with advanced osteoarthritis, and from healthy controls, and then &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34242886/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;imaged them&lt;/a&gt; with their benchtop FCI scanner. The machine is a prototype, so it doesn’t produce images, but it does generate graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians get excited about pictures,” says Ross. “Physicists, like me, get excited about graphs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge differences were seen in the signals from the two tissues, showing that FCI can distinguish osteoarthritic cartilage from its healthy counterpart. But Ross thinks the method is so sensitive that it could also pick up earlier changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, which is currently underway, is to see if it can. As part of the &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis-uk.org/news/2025/january/field-cycling-imaging-fci-a-game-changer-for-the-early-detection-of-osteoarthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PIOKNEER study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers will give annual FCI scans to 300 individuals who have sore knees but no diagnosed osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants will be followed for five years, during which time some, but not all, are expected to develop osteoarthritis. The hope is that FCI will be able to detect early signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An arthritis blood test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, meanwhile, researchers are developing a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj6814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt;. At Duke University, scientists analysed the blood serum (what’s left in the blood after the solids like blood cells have been removed) of 200 women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the women had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, and the other half were healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, they found differences in the composition of the women’s blood. Specifically, levels of just six different proteins distinguished the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery provides the basis for a diagnostic test, which the researchers found was &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/blood-test-finds-knee-osteoarthritis-eight-years-it-appears-x-rays?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=Detecting%20it%20before%20it%20causes%20damage&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dukedaily2024_04_29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;85-per-cent accurate&lt;/a&gt; in identifying the disease and &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/blood-test-finds-knee-osteoarthritis-eight-years-it-appears-x-rays?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=Detecting%20it%20before%20it%20causes%20damage&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dukedaily2024_04_29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;74-per-cent accurate&lt;/a&gt; in predicting its progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of the women, the test detected signs of the disease eight years before joint damage was visible on X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here then is a test with the potential to spot those individuals with achy joints who, very likely, will go on to develop osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opens up a window of opportunity in which drugs, designed to tackle the core biology of osteoarthritis, can get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the road to recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, the only treatments that exist for osteoarthritis focus on relieving symptoms, rather than countering the underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are often offered pain relief and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steroid injections into the affected joint can sometimes bring temporary relief, while studies show that taking &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis-uk.org/information-and-support/understanding-arthritis/arthritis-treatments/complementary-and-alternative-treatments/types-of-complementary-treatment/glucosamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glucosamine&lt;/a&gt;, which is found naturally in joints, can improve pain and mobility in some of those with knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone benefits, however – and when the disease progresses, the only option is surgery. Every year, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4481392/#section8-1947603515586048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around 1.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; have a total knee replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can improve mobility, but the procedure isn’t risk free. And while &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis-uk.org/information-and-support/understanding-arthritis/arthritis-treatments/surgery/knee-replacement-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;80 per cent are happy&lt;/a&gt; with their new knees, many of the remainder struggle with ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-knee-replacement.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="A model of a Total Knee Replacement" class="wp-image-208505"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Knee replacements are amazing feats of medical technology, but don’t work for everyone - Image credit: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why scientists have been devising new, disease-modifying therapies. In the last 20 years, the treatments have been tested in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35546280/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of clinical trials, yet none have made it through to the clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons for this. Some just didn’t work, and others caused unpleasant side effects. But another key issue is the growing realisation that osteoarthritis isn’t a single disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Osteoarthritis is complex,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/nidhi-sofat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof Nidhi Sofat&lt;/a&gt; from St George’s, University of London. “There are lots of different subtypes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sort of osteoarthritis that a menopausal woman develops, for example, will be different to the sort of osteoarthritis that develops in the wake of a knee injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will have a strong genetic component to their disease. Others will have an internal biology that’s inherently more inflammatory, or worse at healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these subtypes will have its own intricacies and its own bespoke biology. As a result, they’re likely to respond differently to different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes when all of the subtypes are lumped under the same label of osteoarthritis and chucked into the same clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs that could work for one of the subgroups might be being overlooked because they don’t work so well for the rest. The baby is being thrown out with the bathwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even positive results can sometimes be misleading. In one &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; for a medication called tanezumab, pain improved, but inside the joint the disease accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those taking the medicine needed knee replacement surgery sooner than was expected, prompting the FDA to pull the plug on the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important then, for new drugs not just to focus the pain caused by osteoarthritis, but on the physical changes that happen to the joint too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Towards a cure for arthritis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the focus was on cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth, slippery tissue that covers the surface of bones and helps them to move freely against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In osteoarthritis, the cartilage deteriorates – but changes also occur to the bone, the lining of the joint capsule (called the synovium) and the tissues surrounding the joint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sofat’s research focuses on bone – specifically, tiny abnormalities inside the bone, called bone marrow lesions. In osteoarthritis, these lesions &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11195245/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can form early&lt;/a&gt;, and co-localise with the pain that people feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dissecting out the lesions and studying them, Sofat has shown they display a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28705915/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole slew of molecular traits&lt;/a&gt;, including signals related to inflammation, pain, nerve and blood vessel formation, cartilage formation and bone cell activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if the bone is trying to make new joint tissue, Sofat explains, but then falling short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a mechanical component to the process, too. We already know that people whose joints are ‘a bit wonky’ – with ligament problems, for example, or spinal misalignment – are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. This is thought to be because the anomaly puts extra pressure on the joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-osteocytes.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Osteoblast bone cell.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/masondj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof Deborah Mason&lt;/a&gt; from Cardiff University has demonstrated the molecular repercussions of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She grows osteocytes, which are the most common type of bone cell, in a squishy collagen gel, and then puts pressure on them – literally – using a 3D-printed mechanical loading device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has found that one burst of pressure changes the activity of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11328832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 7,500 genes&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are related to inflammation, bone activity and pain pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies like those by Mason and Sofat are important because they highlight some of the key biological changes that underpin the disease. This is helping to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11579924/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inform drug development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason, for example, found that the activity of genes related to the neurotransmitter glutamate become altered. So, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003496724097541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;she has&lt;/a&gt; treated &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/134055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rodents with artificially-induced osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, with an injection of a drug that lowers levels of the chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? She discovered that it reduces pain, swelling and joint degeneration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we give it very early on (at onset, before they get osteoarthritis) as a single intervention, we can reduce their disease at the end stage by about a third,” she says. “We find that quite promising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the team are planning to test the drug in human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-mesenchymal-stem-cells.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Mesenchyme. Mesenchymal (stem) cells, embryonic connective tissue, 250X at 35mm" class="wp-image-208509"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future treatments could lie with a type of cell called mesenchymal stem cells, which have the potential to develop into many other types of cells - Image credit: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sofat is encouraged by a different drug, called pentosan polysulphate. The drug, which was previously used to treat bladder issues, is known to have both anti-inflammatory and cartilage-protecting properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After promising animal studies, a handful of small-scale, early-phase clinical trials have shown that the drug can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24678076/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce pain and stiffness&lt;/a&gt;, shrink &lt;a href="https://acrabstracts.org/abstract/therapeutic-effects-of-pentosan-polysulfate-sodium-on-clinical-and-disease-modifying-outcomes-in-subjects-with-knee-osteoarthritis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone marrow lesions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bmcclinpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6904-10-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow the loss of cartilage&lt;/a&gt; and improve joint function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing change at the level of the whole joint,” says Sofat, who was involved in one of the trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that, by targeting early molecular changes with medications that affect the whole joint, osteoarthritis could be prevented. Drugs could modify the disease process and patients need never develop full-blown osteoarthritis at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular solutions for arthritis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach involves cell therapy. In the UK and elsewhere, cell therapy is available for early osteoarthritis in the guise of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique involves taking a small sample of cartilage from an undamaged spot in the problem knee, then growing those cells (known as chondrocytes) in culture for a few weeks, before returning them to the joint immobilised in a scaffold-like membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(‘Autologous’ means the transplant cells come from the patient’s own tissue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-gorilla.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Vets injecting the arm of a gorilla" class="wp-image-208510"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Vets treat an elderly gorilla using stem cell therapy at Budapest Zoo, in Hungary - Image credit: University of Sheffield&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital in the UK, experienced clinicians have treated more than 600 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the first 12 months, most patients experience a good level of symptomatic relief,” says bioengineer &lt;a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/lifesci/ourpeople/karinawright/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof Karina Wright&lt;/a&gt;, who works at the hospital and Keele University. “This can be retained for many, many years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is available in a dozen or so specialist hospitals in the UK, but its use is currently restricted on the NHS to a subgroup of patients who have minimal osteoarthritis, no previous knee surgery, and a hole in their cartilage that is bigger than a 1p coin (which, at 20mm or 0.8 inches in diameter, is a little bigger than a dime). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, researchers are looking at other, cell-based options. Stem cells are attractive because they can make other cell types, and potentially be used to repair the damaged joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/10/8925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; is on a particular type called mesenchymal stem cells, which can be isolated from tissues (such as bone marrow and fat) and coaxed to make bone, cartilage and other tissue types. They also secrete useful molecules that stimulate tissue regeneration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5822967/#:~:text=Given%20the%20success%20in%20generating,82%5D%20(Table%207)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;they’re injected&lt;/a&gt; into the joint in animal models of osteoarthritis, they reduce inflammation, lessen pain, promote cartilage regeneration and improve joint function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots of preclinical evidence for mesenchymal stem cells,” says Wright. Indeed, the treatment is already available for some animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vets offer stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis in &lt;a href="https://www.fitzpatrickreferrals.co.uk/orthopaedics/stem-cell-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.celltherapysciences.co.uk/stem-cell#:~:text=Stem%20Cell%20%E2%80%94%20Cell%20Therapy%20Sciences,personalised%20medicine%20for%20every%20patient." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2023 an elderly gorilla called &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/66660675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liesel&lt;/a&gt;, who lives at Budapest Zoo in Hungary, had mesenchymal stem cell injections for her osteoarthritic knees and hip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/arthritis-cure-gorilla-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Vets wearing face masks look at a laptop screen showing an x-ray of hip joints" class="wp-image-208511"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Liesel the gorilla had mesenchymal stem cell injections for her osteoarthritic knees and hip - Image credit: University of Sheffield&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34039582/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are promising. At RJAH, for example, the &lt;a href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN98997175?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ASCOT trial&lt;/a&gt; is just winding up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright and colleagues have been comparing their tried-and-tested ACI treatment against mesenchymal stem cells and a combination of both cell types in 114 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the full results are yet to be published, Wright is optimistic. “We typically see an 80 per cent success rate with ACI,” she says, “and are seeing similar results across the whole trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely, new drug treatments and cell therapies are emerging, as are early tests to identify those most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers unravel the biology of the disease and what makes one person’s osteoarthritis so different from another’s, we move towards an era not of ‘one treatment fits all’ but of ‘which treatment fits best.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time, I don’t know if my knee pain will develop into osteoarthritis, but I do know that if I can just hang on, in the not too distant future, there will be tests and treatments that help me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington — &lt;/em&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he's "very concerned" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, with a key advisory panel set to meet in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cassidy-louisiana-senator-face-the-nation-transcript-11-16-2025/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Cassidy told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;." "I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, noted that because of the recommended hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth, "we have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccine is safe. It has been established," Cassidy said. "This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations, is set to meet next month. The draft &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; for the Dec. 4-5 meeting includes discussions of the hepatitis B vaccine, and the meeting could entail votes on recommendations. In September, the panel &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassidy has previously weighed in on the panel. In June, the Louisiana Republican called for a postponement of the vaccine meeting after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was "retiring" all 17 members of the panel, before replacing the committee members with his own picks. And in August, Cassidy likewise called for the panel to postpone its September vaccine advisory committee meeting amid a slew of departures from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves represented breaks with Kennedy, who was confirmed as the nation's top health official only after winning support from Cassidy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee after he had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he had raised about vaccines. But Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing "serious commitments" he said he'd received from the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by Brennan whether he regrets his vote to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy said "every reporter asks me that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You live life forward," Cassidy added. "Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The race to develop the next generation of weight loss drugs has taken an interesting new turn. In recent research, Eli Lilly’s experimental treatment eloralintide helped people lose a substantial amount of weight—without needing to use the same approach as existing popular medications like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month in The Lancet, Eli Lilly researchers and others &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)02155-5/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the latest phase II trial results of eloralintide. Over a 48-week span, people taking eloralintide lost up to 20% of their baseline body weight, well above the average weight loss experienced by those on placebo. Eloralintide’s early success so far is all the more notable because it isn’t a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A different mechanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eloralintide mimics the hormone amylin. Our pancreas naturally releases amylin alongside insulin into the bloodstream in response to eating food. Once released, amylin helps tell our body that it’s full, tamps down our appetite, and slows the passage of food through our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most effective weight loss drugs today, such as semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy), are long-acting mimics of the hormone GLP-1. Like GLP-1, amylin plays a part in regulating our hunger and blood sugar control. The two hormones even share some overlap in how they affect the body to carry out these functions. But they also have some key distinctions, and that’s made amylin a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8735818/"&gt;promising new target&lt;/a&gt; for obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is an existing amylin-based drug, pramlintide, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/history/symlin.html"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; two decades ago as a treatment for diabetes. But it’s the newest amylin analogues in development, like eloralintide, that have really excited scientists. These experimental drugs are designed to last much longer in the body than natural amylin, ideally boosting the hormone’s effects to help people lose weight and control their blood sugar. Much like semaglutide, eloralintide is intended to be taken once a week via subcutaneous injection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early promise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly’s phase II trial involved 263 participants without type 2 diabetes who had obesity (a body mass index over 30) or who were overweight (a BMI over 27) with weight-related health conditions. They were randomly assigned to either receive a placebo or varying doses of eloralintide. Some were given the same dosage of the drug throughout the study, while others were given gradually escalating dosages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People on eloralintide, no matter the dosing strategy, saw greater improvements in weight loss over 48 weeks on average compared to the placebo group, the study showed. People taking the highest weekly dose, nine milligrams, saw the best results, an average 20% weight loss during the study, as did people who steadily increased their dose from six to nine milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It also appeared to be safe and generally well-tolerated. The adverse events typically associated with the drug were gastrointestinal, similar to the known side effects of GLP-1 therapy. The most common adverse event was nausea, with about a third of people on the highest dose reporting the symptom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eloralintide produced clinically meaningful, dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight over 48 weeks and was generally well tolerated, supporting eloralintide’s potential use for obesity treatment,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for the future of weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLP-1s have greatly changed the field of obesity medicine in recent years. And though these drugs aren’t &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-simple-strategy-could-curb-one-of-semaglutides-worst-side-effects-2000631330"&gt;risk-free&lt;/a&gt; and can be highly expensive, they’ve already started to turn back the clock on obesity. For the first time in years, America’s obesity rate has &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;noticeably declined&lt;/a&gt; as the use of these drugs has steadily climbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are now &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-obesity-drugs-arent-even-here-yet-2000547636"&gt;plenty of obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; in development, many of which are iterations of GLP-1. Other drugs are combining GLP-1 with other hunger-related hormones, including &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisks-experimental-obesity-drug-cagrisema-shows-blood-pressure-benefits-2025-11-06/"&gt;amylin&lt;/a&gt;. Eloralintide’s results are especially tantalizing, though, since the drug is only relying on amylin. That’s important because it may mean that eloralintide can eventually become an appealing alternative for people who haven’t responded to GLP-1 therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s far too early to be sure, especially without a study directly comparing these medications in a trial. But it’s worth noting that semaglutide only helped people lose about 15% of their body weight on average in clinical trials. Eli Lilly’s existing obesity drug tirzepatide, which pairs GLP-1 and the hormone GIP, has shown weight loss rates hovering around 20%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These early findings will have to be verified by data from larger trials, of course. But if this research continues to show promise, eloralintide could open up a whole new area of obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Medically referred to as Takotsubo syndrome or broken heart syndrome, this condition involves a sudden, reversible weakening of the heart’s left or right ventricle and often closely mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. Although initially considered rare and largely benign, recent research shows that broken heart syndrome can lead to serious cardiovascular complications if it is not recognised and appropriately managed. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9821117/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlights how stress hormones, hormone levels, and the brain-heart connection create measurable effects on cardiac function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does stress affect the heart so strongly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research indicates that Takotsubo syndrome is frequently triggered by a sudden surge of stress hormones, which temporarily stun the heart muscle and impair its ability to pump efficiently. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of catecholamines are central features of this response. Other contributing factors include reduced oestrogen levels, particularly in post-menopausal women, altered brain-heart communication, and inflammatory processes involving cardiac immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This intricate interaction between neurological, hormonal, and cardiovascular systems explains why both emotional and physical stressors can precipitate sudden ventricular dysfunction. Takotsubo syndrome demonstrates that the heart is sensitive not only to physical exertion but also to intense psychological stress, making emotional well-being a crucial factor in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surges of stress hormones can temporarily weaken heart muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catecholamine release and sympathetic activation are central triggers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced oestrogen and inflammatory responses increase vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emotional and physical stressors can both precipitate the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do doctors diagnose broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of Takotsubo syndrome are often indistinguishable from those of a heart attack, including severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and changes in the electrocardiogram or elevated cardiac enzymes. However, patients typically do not have blocked coronary arteries on coronary angiography. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance can reveal the characteristic “apical ballooning” of the left ventricle, giving the condition its informal name of apical ballooning syndrome, highlighting how subtle clinical differences can significantly influence patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differentiating Takotsubo syndrome from acute coronary syndrome is essential because treatment approaches differ substantially. A recent illness, surgery, or intense emotional stress can raise suspicion for Takotsubo syndrome, guiding clinicians toward accurate diagnosis and appropriate management while avoiding unnecessary interventions, ultimately supporting safer outcomes for individuals experiencing severe stress-related cardiac events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms often mimic a heart attack, including chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary arteries generally remain unobstructed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apical ballooning of the left ventricle is a hallmark feature on imaging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate diagnosis ensures correct and effective management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the hidden risks of broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many patients recover fully, Takotsubo syndrome is not entirely harmless. Complications can include heart failure, cardiogenic shock, irregular heart rhythms, and, in rare cases, left ventricular rupture. Early complications occur in approximately twenty per cent of patients, and mortality rates can approach those seen in acute coronary syndrome. Women, especially those who are post-menopausal, are disproportionately affected, while physical stressors such as surgery or severe illness are nearly as common as emotional triggers. The wide spectrum of potential complications underscores the importance of recognising Takotsubo syndrome as a serious cardiovascular condition rather than a symbolic or purely emotional response. These serious complications highlight the need for early diagnosis, cardiac monitoring, and awareness of risk factors such as stress triggers, hormonal changes, underlying heart disease, and immune responses, which can influence prognosis, recovery time, and long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Takotsubo syndrome can lead to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and rare ventricular rupture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early complications occur in about twenty per cent of patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women, particularly post-menopausal, are most at risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical stress can trigger the condition as frequently as emotional events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is broken heart syndrome managed and treated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management of Takotsubo syndrome primarily involves acute monitoring of cardiac function and treatment of any heart failure symptoms. Physicians may prescribe beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers based on the patient’s cardiac status and existing comorbidities. Because overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is a central mechanism, treatment aims to support recovery while limiting additional stress on the heart. Long-term strategies often include stress-reduction techniques, lifestyle adjustments, and follow-up imaging to ensure that ventricular function returns to normal. Continued research into molecular mechanisms may allow for more targeted and precise therapies in the future, improving both recovery and prognosis for affected patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute care includes careful monitoring and symptom management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can support heart recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress-reduction strategies and lifestyle modifications are important for long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow-up imaging confirms full recovery of ventricular function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What remains unknown about broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite advances, many questions about Takotsubo syndrome remain unanswered. The precise interactions of the brain-heart axis, individual genetic susceptibility, and the reasons for recurrence are still under investigation. Some patients continue to experience persistent cardiac symptoms even after apparent recovery. Interestingly, Takotsubo syndrome can occasionally occur after intensely positive emotional events, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “happy heart syndrome.” Ongoing research into inflammation, microvascular function, and molecular biomarkers may ultimately allow clinicians to predict susceptibility, anticipate complications, and develop interventions that are tailored to the unique pathways involved in this complex condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;For over a century, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kopi luwak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been both admired and questioned. It’s made from coffee cherries eaten by the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asian palm civet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a small nocturnal mammal found across &lt;strong&gt;South and Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;. The civet digests the fruit, but not the bean, which it excretes whole. People collect the beans from the animal’s feces, wash and process them, and roast them into a coffee that can sell for &lt;strong&gt;up to $1,000 a kilo&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its rarity, weird backstory, and supposed smoothness have made it a favorite among collectors and curious drinkers. But up until now, the idea that the civet’s digestive system actually changed the coffee in a meaningful way was just a guess. Researchers from &lt;em&gt;India’s Central University of Kerala&lt;/em&gt;, writing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that&lt;em&gt; Kopi luwak &lt;/em&gt;does have a unique chemical profile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Wild Digestive System Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest things the researchers found was that the beans collected from civet droppings were &lt;strong&gt;larger&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;richer in fat&lt;/strong&gt; than normal ones. That might be because civets are picky eaters in the wild, they tend to go for the ripest, best-quality cherries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, led by zoologist &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://schools.cukerala.ac.in/Dept/Faculty_Preview?Id=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Palatty Allesh Sinu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, revealed that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-reveal-newly-discovered-protein-could-be-the-secret-to-reversing-aging-%e2%8f%b3/" data-type="post" data-id="73951"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/caffeine-intake-dangerous-heart-risks/" data-type="post" data-id="7529"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;caffeine levels&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;were basically the same between regular beans and those digested by civets. But there were major changes in other compounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kopi luwak &lt;/em&gt;beans had &lt;strong&gt;higher levels of caprylic acid and capric acid methyl esters&lt;/strong&gt;, which are linked to improved flavor and a creamier, milk-like smell. The team say this supports the idea that the civet’s natural digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These observations go with the hypothesis that the civet’s digestive process, comprising natural fermentation along with the enzymatic uptake, modifies the beans’ chemical composition, intensifying the flavor and adding to the distinctive sensory characteristics of civet coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Luxury At The Cost Of Animal Welfare&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the flavor might now be backed by science, the way &lt;em&gt;Kopi luwak&lt;/em&gt; is produced today often &lt;strong&gt;raises red flags&lt;/strong&gt;. What started as a natural process, collecting beans from wild animals, has turned into a commercial operation where civets are &lt;strong&gt;captured&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;caged&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;force-fed coffee cherries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As demand has grown, civets are no longer just part of the wild ecosystem. According to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-expensive-coffee-is-chemically-different-because-its-literally-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, many are kept in tiny metal cages, fed a one-food diet, and denied any natural behavior. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Map-showing-the-study-area-1200x824.webp" alt="Map Showing The Study Area" class="wp-image-109663" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Map-showing-the-study-area-scaled.webp 1200w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Map-showing-the-study-area-420x288.webp 420w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Map-showing-the-study-area-520x357.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Map showing the study area. Credit: Scientific Reports&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These conditions have drawn criticism from &lt;strong&gt;animal rights groups&lt;/strong&gt; and responsible coffee producers, who argue that no luxury drink is worth that kind of suffering. It’s worth noting that the beans used in the Kerala study came from &lt;strong&gt;wild civets&lt;/strong&gt;, not farmed ones, something that’s becoming less and less common in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Secret Ingredient That Could Redefine Premium Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the chemical differences uncovered in the study, it might soon be possible to &lt;strong&gt;identify real Kopi luwak beans&lt;/strong&gt; based on their composition. The researchers suggest this could help crack down on fakes and encourage &lt;strong&gt;more ethical sourcing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@foodporn/video/7278417839508180225" data-video-id="7278417839508180225" data-embed-from="oembed"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@foodporn" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@foodporn?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;@foodporn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would you try this? This is Luwak Coffee and it is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm Civet or Luwak. The cherries are fermented as they pass through a Civet’s intestines.😁 It has a sweeter and less bitter flavour than traditional coffee 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryou" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;#foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="coffee" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coffee?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;#coffee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="indonesia" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/indonesia?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;#indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="bali" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bali?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;#bali&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Foodporn" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7278417883980401410?refer=embed" rel="noopener"&gt;♬ original sound – Foodporn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using indicators like caprylic acid levels, sellers could prove their beans were collected ethically, from wild animals and not farms. Buyers, in turn, would get more transparency and a clearer idea of what they’re actually paying for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also called for more research into the &lt;strong&gt;molecular aroma profile&lt;/strong&gt; of these beans, hoping it could lead to better authentication tools and less animal exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study presented at the American Heart Association's scientific meetings has raised concerns about melatonin, one of Britain's most commonly prescribed sleep  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;aids&lt;/a&gt;. The findings suggest that long-term users face a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the preliminary data demands careful scrutiny before the alarm is sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/melatonin-15404"&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed in the UK for nearly two decades, with 2.5 million prescriptions issued in England &lt;a href="https://openprescribing.net/chemical/0401010AD/"&gt;last year alone&lt;/a&gt;. The drug is a synthetic version of the hormone naturally produced in the brain – the so-called "hormone of darkness" that regulates our sleep–wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, it's been &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/melatonin/who-can-and-cannot-take-melatonin/"&gt;considered safe&lt;/a&gt; for treating short-term sleep problems in adults and, under specialist supervision, for children with learning disabilities or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published only as a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;brief summary&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed electronic health records of roughly 130,000 adults with sleep difficulties over five years – half of whom took melatonin and half of whom didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who took melatonin for at least a year were roughly three times more likely to be hospitalized with heart failure than non-users (19 percent of people who took melatonin versus 6.6 percent of people who did not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term users also faced higher rates of heart failure diagnosis and death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attempted to balance their comparison by matching melatonin users with non-users across 40 factors, including age, health conditions and medications. Yet the study found only an association, not causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction matters. Correlation doesn't prove that melatonin caused heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil, as ever, lives in the missing details. Only a 300-word summary of the study exists so far, meaning crucial information – melatonin dosage, insomnia severity, lifestyle factors – remains unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methodology raises questions. It relied on electronic medical records rather than direct patient follow-up or interviews, which can leave gaps in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research drew from TriNetX Global Research Network, a large international database. But healthcare practices and record-keeping vary wildly between hospitals and nations, potentially skewing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, melatonin requires a prescription for specific conditions. But in the US, it's sold over the counter – purchases that are often not documented in medical records. This means some people categorized as non-users may actually have been taking melatonin, muddying the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The missing piece of the puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even assuming both groups were correctly identified and matched, a key question lingers: why did one group receive melatonin while the other didn't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps those prescribed the drug suffered more severe or disruptive sleep problems – symptoms that might reflect underlying health issues, including heart problems. If so, melatonin might simply be a marker of existing risk rather than the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.70107"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; in heart failure patients suggested melatonin may actually protect heart health by improving psychological wellbeing and heart function. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12829"&gt;Other research indicated&lt;/a&gt; it could ease symptoms in people with heart failure and serve as a safe complementary therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study exists only as an abstract, it hasn't undergone  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;. And information on the study's methods and results remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are noteworthy and raise legitimate questions about the long-term risks of using this supplement, they're far from conclusive. Further studies are needed to determine whether prolonged melatonin use affects heart health, and if so, how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors face a familiar balancing act: weighing treatment benefits against potential risks. Poor sleep doesn't just affect the heart; it's linked to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/sleep-disorders/sleep-and-heart-health#:%7E:text=Sleep%20disorders%20such%20as%20insomnia%2C%20apnea%2C%20narcolepsy%20and,linked%20to%20a%20higher%20risk%20of%20cardiovascular%20diseases."&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with metabolism, mental health and the immune system, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically start with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/"&gt;lifestyle changes, better sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; and talk therapy. But when these fail to improve sleep quality, short-term medication may be necessary to restore healthy patterns and prevent further health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The melatonin story isn't over. It's just beginning. Until fuller evidence emerges, panic seems premature.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269131/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Penn-led team has revealed how hydralazine, one of the world's oldest blood pressure drugs and a mainstay treatment for preeclampsia, works at the molecular level. In doing so, they made a surprising discovery—it can also halt the growth of aggressive brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 70 years, hydralazine has been an indispensable tool in medicine—a front-line defense against life-threatening &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, especially during pregnancy. But despite its essential role, a fundamental mystery has persisted: No one knows its "mechanism of action"—essentially how it works at a molecular level, which allows for improved efficacy, safety, and what it can treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hydralazine is one of the earliest vasodilators ever developed, and it's still a first-line treatment for preeclampsia—a hypertensive disorder that accounts for 5%–15% of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/maternal+deaths/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;maternal deaths&lt;/a&gt; worldwide," says Kyosuke Shishikura, a physician-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. "It came from a 'pre-target' era of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+discovery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers relied on what they saw in patients first and only later tried to explain the biology behind it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Shishikura, his postdoctoral adviser at Penn Megan Matthews, and collaborators have solved this long-standing puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx7687" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, the team uncovered the method of action of hydralazine, and in doing so, revealed an unexpected biological link between hypertensive disorders and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The findings highlight how long-established treatments can reveal new therapeutic potential and could help in the design of safer, more effective drugs for both maternal health and brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preeclampsia has affected generations of women in my own family and continues to disproportionately impact Black mothers in the United States," Matthews says. "Understanding how hydralazine works at the molecular level offers a path toward safer, more selective treatments for pregnancy-related hypertension—potentially improving outcomes for patients who are at greatest risk."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Hydralazine blocks an oxygen-sensing enzyme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that hydralazine blocks an oxygen-sensing enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO)—a molecular switch that tells blood vessels when to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ADO is like an alarm bell that rings the moment oxygen starts to fall," Matthews says. "Most systems in the body take time; they have to copy DNA, make RNA, and build new proteins. ADO skips all that. It flips a biochemical switch in seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydralazine acts by binding to and blocking ADO, which means it effectively "mutes" that oxygen alarm. Once the enzyme was silenced, the signaling proteins it normally degrades—called regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS)—remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buildup of RGS proteins, says Shishikura, tells the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; to stop constricting, effectively overriding the "squeeze" signal. This reduces intracellular calcium levels, which he calls the "master regulator of vascular tension." As calcium levels fall, the smooth muscles in blood vessel walls relax, causing vasodilation and a drop in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From preeclampsia to brain cancer: A common target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this study, cancer researchers and clinicians had begun to suspect that ADO was important in glioblastoma, where tumors often have to survive in pockets of very low oxygen, Shishikura explains. Elevated levels of ADO and its metabolic products had been linked with more aggressive disease, suggesting that shutting this enzyme down could be a powerful strategy, but no one had a good inhibitor to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if hydralazine was a contender, Shishikura worked closely with structural biochemists at the University of Texas, who used X-ray crystallography, a high-resolution imaging technique, to visualize hydralazine bound to ADO's metal center, and with neuroscientists at the University of Florida, who tested the drug's effects in brain cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the ADO pathway that regulates vascular contraction also helps &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; survive in low-oxygen environments. Unlike chemotherapy, which aims to kill all cells outright, hydralazine disrupted that oxygen-sensing loop, triggering cellular "senescence," or a dormant, non-dividing state in glioblastoma cells, effectively pausing growth without triggering further inflammation or resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the potential for other lifesaving treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the next step is to push the chemistry further by building new ADO inhibitors that are more tissue specific and better at crossing, or exploiting weak points in, the blood-brain barrier so they hit tumor tissue hard while sparing the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthews is also working to continue engineering the next generation of medical solutions by revealing the mechanics of clinically tested, long-known treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's rare that an old cardiovascular drug ends up teaching us something new about the brain," Matthews says, "but that's exactly what we're hoping to find more of—unusual links that could spell new solutions."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class="post-info"&gt;Toronto, Canada, Nov 16, 2025 /
            08:00 am&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Sixteen hundred years ago, St. Augustine was credited with saying, “He who sings, prays twice.” Today, scientific research shows that he who sings, performs, or listens to music also enriches and strengthens his brain, according to Catholic neuroscientist Kathlyn Gan.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but sacred music may produce even more beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Gan, who leads a research laboratory at the University of Toronto, delivered the uplifting news to about 50 people at an Oct. 30 talk at St. Francis de Sales in Burnaby, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;In her hourlong presentation “The Neuroscience of Sacred Music,” Gan, a former choir director and accompanist, described how research showing that music can be part of a healthy lifestyle that helps counter the mental decline that accompanies aging.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p class="my-4 lightest-grey-bg py-3 body-ad" id="div-gpt-ad-1439931607151-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Music can also help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, which, in up to 95% of cases, can be driven by nongenetic factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, deafness, brain injury, and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Not only does music stimulate the brain in special ways, but it also fosters healthy social connections when performed in a group setting, said Gan, currently a liturgical musician in the Archdiocese of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;figure class="mx-auto"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/neuro-3525.jpg?w=600" class="img-fluid" alt="Music activates different parts of the brain, strengthening pathways for memory, movement, emotion, and empathy, said Kathlyn Gan at St. Francis de Sales in Burnaby, Ontario.

                                                          &lt;p&gt;Speaking with The B.C. Catholic, she said music is encoded and integrated by multiple brain regions, stimulating neural pathways that regulate memory, movement, reward, emotion, and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p class="my-4 lightest-grey-bg py-3 body-ad" id="div-gpt-ad-1441212700470-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                    &lt;p&gt;
                
              &lt;/p&gt;
                                              &lt;p&gt;“Based on those effects, music can help us keep our minds active and foster social connections, which in turn can help us mitigate the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Gan, who earned her doctorate at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby and did postdoctoral studies at Stanford University in California, said music therapy is widely used as part of a holistic treatment approach to improve behavioral issues and encourage social connections during mid- to late-stage Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Gan noted that the CBC recently reported that doctors in Montreal have partnered with the city’s symphony orchestra to prescribe music as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;“Physicians will get prescriptions that they will give to patients,” said Mélanie La Couture, CEO of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. “The patients will call us, and we will give each patient that calls us two tickets for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p class="my-4 lightest-grey-bg py-3 body-ad" id="div-gpt-ad-1507207562539-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Even more benefits could conceivably come from listening to or singing sacred music, which Gan defines as any music — from chant and classical to jazz and gospel — that contributes to the solemnity and beauty of the Mass, promotes deeper reflection on the scriptural readings and homily, and glorifies God.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;That said, it will be challenging for scientists to prove sacred music’s special benefits because of listeners’ or musicians’ subjective perceptions of music and their varying depth of spiritual formation and understanding, Gan said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;At the very least, however, listening to or performing sacred music helps a person grow in faith and to love God, she said in her presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Along with the three degrees she earned at SFU, Gan also holds an associate diploma from the Royal Conservatory of Music and is an accomplished classical pianist who shares her talent and faith in churches and the wider community. These outings include performances with her piano students at retirement homes and long-term care facilities, as well as playing piano in music-therapy and spiritual-care programs.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                &lt;p class="mb-0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Story continues below)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;She views her music ministry as a form of prayer that challenges her not only to recognize scriptural themes and imagery but also to communicate them “in a manner that honors the historical context of the hymns and shares my own spirituality and lived experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Her studies and ministry have not only deepened her appreciation for the human mind’s complexity and capacity for mirroring Christ’s humility, compassion, forgiveness, and love, but they’ve also “encouraged my spiritual growth and enriched my faith,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

However, new findings suggest it may also play a helpful role in protecting heart health, particularly in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj-2023-075230" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A recent study published in The BMJ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that regular vitamin D supplementation may modestly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular issues, including heart attacks. While the benefits are not dramatic, they add to growing evidence that vitamin D’s influence extends beyond bones and immunity. For ageing individuals, especially those already managing heart risks, maintaining healthy vitamin D levels may offer an additional layer of support for long-term cardiovascular well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;How Vitamin D supports heart health as you age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. As people age, the risks of heart attacks, blocked arteries, and related complications rise sharply. Earlier studies had noticed that people with low vitamin D levels often had higher cardiovascular risk, but the evidence from controlled trials had been inconsistent. The latest research attempts to clear that uncertainty, showing that vitamin D may contribute to cardiovascular protection, especially in older adults and those already managing heart risk through medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D appears to support heart health by helping regulate blood pressure, reducing inflammation in blood vessels, improving arterial elasticity, and supporting proper calcium balance in the heart and vascular system. Moreover, adequate vitamin D may enhance the effects of cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure medications, reduce the likelihood of heart rhythm disturbances, and strengthen overall cardiac function, potentially lowering the risk of heart attacks and other serious events as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notable benefits of Vitamin D for heart attacks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest findings was a reduced risk of heart attacks. This effect, while still modest, was more pronounced than other cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential support for those already on heart medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were already using medications like statins appeared to benefit more from vitamin D supplementation. This suggests vitamin D might work well as an added supportive measure, especially for individuals already managing heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No clear reduction in stroke risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart attack risk showed improvement, the study did not find a significant difference in the risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible reduction in major heart problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those taking vitamin D showed a slightly lower likelihood of developing serious heart-related issues over the study period&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who might find Vitamin D most helpful&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research points to certain groups who might benefit the most:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older adults, especially those above 60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are already taking heart-related medications, such as statins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals with low sun exposure or limited dietary intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, vitamin D should not be viewed as a substitute for medical treatment or lifestyle changes. Instead, it may serve as a simple addition to broader heart-health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Important considerations and limitations&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are encouraging, experts note a few important points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The benefit, though real, is moderate, not dramatic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study may not represent people with severe vitamin D deficiency, since many such individuals were not included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D supplements are not a standalone solution for preventing heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still, given its low cost and generally safe profile, vitamin D remains a potentially useful tool in supporting long-term heart health, when taken responsibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What this means for older adults&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ageing adults, maintaining optimal vitamin D levels may offer an additional layer of cardiovascular protection. When combined with established measures like healthy eating, regular physical activity, and medication when needed, vitamin D supplementation could enhance overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should you consider taking Vitamin D&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting supplements, it’s advisable to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speak with a healthcare professional&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your current vitamin D levels, if recommended&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confirm the right dosage, as excessive intake can be harmful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, vitamin D works best as part of a broader healthy lifestyle, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating a balanced, nutrient-rich diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercising regularly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing cholesterol and blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undergoing routine medical check-ups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Having a cat as a pet could potentially double a person's risk of schizophrenia-related conditions, according to an analysis of 17 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist John McGrath and colleagues at the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research in Australia looked at papers published over the last 44 years in 11 countries, including the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their 2023 study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; "a significant positive association between broadly defined cat ownership and an increased risk of schizophrenia-related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a need for more high-quality studies in this field," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adorable-cat-helps-scientists-discover-new-virus-for-second-time"&gt;Adorable Cat Helps Scientists Discover New Virus (For Second Time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea that cat ownership could be linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="181568" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; risk was proposed in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/21.2.167"&gt;1995 study&lt;/a&gt;, with exposure to a parasite called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested as a cause. But the research so far has put forth mixed conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/128008-association-between-childhood-exposure-to-pet-cats-and-later-diagnosis-of-schizophrenia-a-case-control-study-in-saudi-arabia#!/"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that being around cats during childhood might make a person more likely to develop schizophrenia; however, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225320"&gt;not all research&lt;/a&gt; has found an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149648" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC.gif" alt="Diagram of toxoplasmosis lifecycle" class="wp-image-149648 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC.gif 700w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-642x519.gif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-513x415.gif 513w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-600x485.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149648" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toxoplasmosis is only known to reproduce in cats (1), but can be spread to humans through intermediate hosts (2, 5, 7) as well.

Meanwhile, researchers keep finding more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mind-altering-parasite-may-make-infected-people-more-attractive-study-suggests"&gt;strange effects that infections may have&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside our bodies, &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate the central nervous system and influence neurotransmitters. The parasite has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-parasite-has-been-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-rage-disorder"&gt;linked to personality changes&lt;/a&gt;, the emergence of psychotic symptoms, and some neurological disorders, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/50-year-old-theory-on-schizophrenias-voices-confirmed-by-recent-study"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a link doesn't prove &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; causes these changes or that the parasite was passed on to a human from a cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture.jpg" alt="Cat lying in kitty litter box" class="wp-image-147484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture-514x415.jpg 514w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture-600x484.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cat feces could be the source of toxoplasmosis. &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-cat-laying-in-a-bowl-on-the-floor-4ZelmqpEcOg"&gt;frosted_vulpes_ferrilata/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After adjusting for covariates, we found that individuals exposed to cats had approximately twice the odds of developing schizophrenia," the Australian team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some important things to keep in mind here, like the fact that 15 of the 17 studies were case-control studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of research can't show cause and effect, and it often doesn't account for factors that may have affected both the exposure and the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also highlight the low quality of a number of the examined studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results were inconsistent across studies, but those of higher quality suggested that associations in unadjusted models might have been due to factors that could have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225320"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; no significant association between owning a cat before age 13 and later developing schizophrenia, but it did identify a significant link when narrowing down cat ownership to a specific period (ages 9 to 12). This inconsistency suggests that the critical window for cat exposure is not well defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996413001436?via=ihub"&gt;study in the US&lt;/a&gt;, which involved 354 psychology students, didn't find a connection between owning a cat and schizotypy scores. However, those who had received a cat bite had higher scores when compared to those who had not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000505786"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, which included people with and without mental disorders, discovered a connection between cat bites and higher scores on tests measuring particular psychological experiences.

For example, in Agwu’s state of Maryland, cases are at “four to five times what they saw this time last year,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Matthew Thomas" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Matthew Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at WVU Medicine Golisano Children’s in West Virginia, said spikes typically happen in cycles. “Some years you’ll see a lot of cases, like we’re seeing this year, and then it kind of fades away, where you don’t hear about it for a while,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases higher than normal, it’s important to know the signs of the virus and what to do if you (or your kids) get sick. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the name suggests, symptoms include blisters on the hands, feet and mouth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth is a virus within the family of enteroviruses, explained &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jennifer Duchon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Duchon&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the divisions of pediatric infectious disease and newborn medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enteroviruses can present with a range of symptoms. In the case of hand, foot and mouth, “people can have symptoms like a common cold,” according to Thomas. This includes a fever, Agwu added, in addition to respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But then a common feature is that they will have a rash, typically on the hands and feet, as well as ulcers or blisters within the mouth,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blisters in the mouth are generally at the back of the throat and are often really painful, according to Duchon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the hands and feet, the rash may appear as little red bumps. “Those show up a couple days after the fever,” Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people’s hands will start to peel when the rash starts to go away, their feet will start to peel after the rash goes away,” Duchon said. “In really dramatic cases, sometimes your fingernails can fall off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease can cause blister-like bumps.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disease spreads through respiratory droplets and fecal matter and can live on surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is “super contagious,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spreads through respiratory droplets that go out in the air when someone coughs or sneezes, according to Thomas. It can also spread via the fluid from the blisters or via infected surfaces. So if a child who has the virus drools on toys at daycare, other kids could get sick from those toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also spread in stool, so particularly for our infants who are not yet potty trained, someone who’s changing diapers is often putting themselves at risk,” Thomas said. For parents or caretakers changing dirty diapers, good hand hygiene is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most children and adults recover easily at home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the virus certainly can be gruesome, and often painful, most people do recover at home with the help of symptomatic care such as fever-reducing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no specific medications for hand, foot and mouth, and since it’s a viral illness, “no antibiotics are going to get rid of it,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your children do get sick, you should “try to avoid spreading it to anyone else,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is sick with hand, foot and mouth should isolate from others so they don’t pass on the virus, while also hydrating and eating enough nutrients. The virus tends to last for about a week in most people, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having more severe symptoms, like if you’re having a lot of ulcers in your mouth, it may take up to 10 to 14 days to resolve fully,” Thomas added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people require additional care, though. If you aren’t able to hydrate, or keep your sick child hydrated, you should seek medical care, Thomas noted. The same is true if whoever is sick isn’t able to eat enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duchon added, “If you’ve had hand, foot and mouth and afterwards, or towards the end of the illness, you’re feeling really, really tired or having trouble breathing, those are things that are really serious to look for that can mean that the heart has been affected. That’s a very rare but serious complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand-washing is a good way to protect yourself from catching this virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things you can do to keep yourself from getting sick with hand, foot and mouth and other viruses that are currently circulating such as the common cold and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way to prevent it is going to be always the same thing — washing hands ... if you’re touching something that’s problematic, like stool or what have you, making sure you’re doubling down on using good hand hygiene,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re out and about, a “good alcohol-based hand sanitizer” is a fine option, too, but hand-washing with soap and water is ideal, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to avoid touching your face as much as you can, Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden campaign-cta"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join HuffPost members who keep fearless, inclusive journalism alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

In 1855, James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"}' href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Magazine&lt;/em&gt; that these wine “tears” or “legs” result from the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water. “This fact affords an explanation of several very curious motions,” Thomson wrote. Little did he realize that the same effect, later named the Marangoni effect, might also shape how embryos develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In March, a group of biophysicists in France &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02802-2" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Marangoni effect is responsible for the pivotal moment when a homogeneous blob of cells elongates and develops a head-and-tail axis — the first defining features of the organism it will become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The finding is part of a trend that defies the norm in biology. Typically, biologists try to characterize growth, development, and other biological processes as the result of chemical cues triggered by genetic instructions. But that picture has often seemed incomplete. Researchers now increasingly appreciate the role of mechanical forces in biology: forces that push and pull tissues in response to their material properties, steering growth and development in ways that genes cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Modern imaging and measurement techniques have opened scientists’ eyes to these forces by flooding the field with data that invites mechanical interpretations. “What has changed over the past decades is really the possibility to watch what happens live, and to see the mechanics in terms of cell movement, cell rearrangement, tissue growth,” said &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/"}' href="https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pierre-François Lenne&lt;/a&gt; of Aix Marseille University, one of the researchers behind the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The shift toward mechanical explanations has revived interest in pre-genetic models of biology. For example, in 1917 the Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar D’Arcy Thompson published &lt;em&gt;On Growth and Form&lt;/em&gt;, which highlighted similarities between the shapes found among living organisms and those that emerge in nonliving matter. Thompson wrote the book as an antidote to what he thought was an excessive tendency to explain everything in terms of Darwinian natural selection. His thesis—that physics, too, shapes us—is coming back into vogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ byeLF caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption standard" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE fGraOh caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-lapse movie of a gastruloid developing a head-to-tail axis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's fresh hope for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-vision-loss-may-brew-inside-the-gut-scientists-say"&gt;early detection&lt;/a&gt; and new treatments of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/a&gt;, a group of eye diseases that have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-eye-test-can-detect-glaucoma-4-years-before-current-tests"&gt;devastating effects on vision&lt;/a&gt; – and for which there is currently no cure. A new study has identified two natural molecules that play an important role in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine"&gt;agmatine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"&gt;thiamine&lt;/a&gt; (also known as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="181436" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B1), and their role in protecting against glaucoma was discovered by researchers led by a team from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists suggest that agmatine and thiamine could be used as biomarkers for earlier detection of glaucoma, allowing doctors to put preventative measures in place at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/space-can-hurt-your-vision-and-now-we-can-predict-the-damage"&gt;Space Can Hurt Your Vision, And Now We Can Predict The Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In several cases, people do not find out they have glaucoma until they are older and their eye pressure is elevated," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ophthalmology researcher Pawan Singh, from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules could also help with new treatments: boosting the levels of agmatine and thiamine in mice was shown to reduce inflammation in the retina, protect the retinal ganglion nerve cells (RGCs) that are typically damaged by glaucoma, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-eye-exercises-improve-your-vision-an-expert-reveals-the-truth"&gt;improve the vision&lt;/a&gt; of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined a fluid in the eye called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"&gt;aqueous humor&lt;/a&gt; in 19 glaucoma patients and 10 healthy people, testing for 135 different &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt;. Of those, agmatine and thiamine were found to be especially reduced in people with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Agmatine and thiamine could be potential immunomodulatory or neuroprotective drugs to treat or prevent neuroinflammatory damage to the retina during glaucoma," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg" alt="Chemical level chart" class="wp-image-181439 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels-600x462.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked for chemical abnormalities in the eyes of people with glaucoma. (Monu et al., &lt;em&gt;Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

It's often, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glaucoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372839"&gt;but not always&lt;/a&gt;, linked to elevated pressure in the eye – something that current treatments focus on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments can only really slow down the disease though. Agmatine and thiamine show promise in stopping the progression of nerve cell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eyes-can-shed-light-on-underlying-health-problems"&gt;damage in the eye&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps reverse some of the damage that's already been done. However, a lot of further study is needed before this can be used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our long-term goal is to see if doctors could one day do a simple blood test to check for these biomarkers," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can, hopefully they will be able to catch the disease much earlier, before vision loss occurs, so patients can receive treatment sooner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that ADHD involves differences in how emotional and cognitive brain circuits are physically wired during development. Although these differences are subtle, they could play a role in shaping the severity of symptoms across childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD has increasingly been conceptualized as a disorder that affects the brain’s connectivity. Many studies have focused on the brain’s outer cortical regions, such as the frontal lobes, which are involved in attention and executive function. However, less is known about how deeper brain structures, like those in the limbic system, develop in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limbic system helps regulate emotion and integrates emotional signals with cognitive processes. It is also implicated in behavioral regulation, impulse control, and mood—all areas where people with ADHD often experience difficulties. Emotional dysregulation is especially common in ADHD and can affect quality of life. Given the limbic system’s role in emotion and behavior, the researchers aimed to better understand how its white matter—bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain regions—develops in youth with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal brain imaging research allows scientists to examine how brain structures change over time. By focusing on the limbic system and using more advanced imaging techniques than in past research, the authors of this study hoped to uncover developmental patterns that may help explain why some symptoms of ADHD persist or worsen during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most research on ADHD brain development has focused on the outer regions of the brain, especially the frontal and striatal areas linked to attention and control,” said study author Michael Connaughton of the Department of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to look deeper – literally – into the limbic system, the brain’s emotional core that connects feeling, motivation, and focus. These regions have been difficult to study because of their complexity and location, but new MRI analysis techniques now let us see them with much finer detail. That opened the door to an important question: how do emotion-related brain pathways mature in ADHD as children move through adolescence?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed brain imaging data from 169 children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 14. Among them, 72 had been diagnosed with ADHD, while 97 served as a comparison group without the disorder. Each participant underwent advanced diffusion MRI scans at three different time points spaced about 18 months apart. This approach allowed researchers to track changes in brain white matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key strength of this study was that ADHD was confirmed at multiple time points, showing that participants met diagnostic criteria both early and later in development,” Connaughton noted. “This repeated confirmation is crucial for developmental research – it ensures we’re capturing stable features of ADHD rather than temporary fluctuations that can occur as children grow and symptoms change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an advanced brain imaging technique called diffusion kurtosis imaging to examine the structure of white matter in the brain. This method tracks how water molecules move through brain tissue. In healthy white matter, which consists of tightly packed, insulated nerve fibers, water tends to move in a highly organized way. When the structure is less orderly, water movement becomes more random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific measurement, called kurtosis anisotropy, captures this level of organization. Higher kurtosis anisotropy values indicate that the white matter fibers are well-organized and likely well-myelinated, meaning they are coated with a protective layer that helps electrical signals travel efficiently. Lower values suggest that the white matter may be less developed or less efficient at supporting fast communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on five major white matter tracts in the limbic system, including the cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in both cognition and emotion. They also constructed brain network models to assess how different parts of the limbic system were interconnected in each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the control group, the children with ADHD showed lower kurtosis anisotropy in both the left and right cingulum bundles. These reductions were present across all three time points, suggesting that the white matter differences were not due to temporary fluctuations but instead reflected a stable, early-emerging feature of ADHD. The pattern of white matter development followed a typical trajectory over time, but those with ADHD started out at a lower baseline and did not catch up to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with ADHD showed stable reductions in limbic system white matter microstructural organisation, specifically lower kurtosis anisotropy in the bilateral cingulum bundle, across childhood and adolescence,” Connaughton told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the overall number and efficiency of connections within the limbic system did not significantly differ between the ADHD and control groups when considered as a whole. However, when the researchers looked at symptom severity within the ADHD group, a clearer picture emerged. Children and adolescents with more severe ADHD symptoms tended to have lower network density and reduced routing efficiency in their limbic system connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What stood out most was that connectivity within the limbic system network predicted symptom severity rather than diagnosis,” Connaughton said. “This reinforces the view of ADHD as a dimensional condition, existing along a continuum rather than as a categorical divide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between limbic system connectivity and symptom severity was not explained by differences in the cingulum bundle, suggesting that both local microstructure and broader network organization may contribute to ADHD symptoms in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences observed in the study were relatively small in size, but they were consistent. “They aren’t large enough for clinical prediction, but in neurodevelopment, small differences across interconnected systems can still influence symptom severity and presentation,” Connaughton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings indicate that ADHD involves early, stable disruptions in limbic white matter development, particularly within the cingulum, and that reductions in white matter interconnecting limbic regions become more pronounced in individuals with more severe ADHD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than pointing to a single brain abnormality, the results support the idea that ADHD involves distributed, small-scale differences across multiple systems. These differences may arise early in life and contribute to how symptoms unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results don’t point to a single ‘ADHD biomarker,'” Connaughton said. “They reflect group- level trends, not diagnostic markers, and should be seen as part of a larger developmental picture that combines genetics, environment, and experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers important insights but also has some limitations. One issue is that the limbic system does not have a universally agreed-upon anatomical definition. Different studies may include or exclude certain regions, which can complicate comparisons across research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age range studied was also relatively narrow, focusing on the transition from late childhood into early adolescence. Some individuals with ADHD may show delayed brain development that catches up later in adolescence or early adulthood. Extending the research to cover a wider age range could help clarify whether the differences observed here persist, worsen, or diminish over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to track these developmental changes across the lifespan, extending our work into late adolescence and early adulthood when brain connectivity continues to evolve,” Connaughton explained. “By following individuals over longer periods and integrating imaging with genetic and behavioural data, we can begin to see how early brain differences unfold, stabilize, or adapt over time. The goal is to build a lifespan model of ADHD that helps both patients and clinicians understand why symptoms persist or remit across life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.09.022" target="_blank"&gt;Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michael Connaughton, Alexander Leemans, Timothy J.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;While companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink are hard at work on brain-computer interfaces that require surgery to cut open the skull and insert a complex array of wires into a person’s head, a team of researchers at MIT have been researching a wireless electronic brain implant that they say could provide a non-invasive alternative that makes the technology far easier to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;They describe the system, called Circulatronics, as more of a treatment platform than a one-off brain chip. Working with researchers from Wellesley College and Harvard University, the MIT team recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02809-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;released a paper&lt;/a&gt; on the new technology, which they describe as an autonomous bioelectronic implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://newatlas.com/brain/mit-injectable-brain-chips-treat-disease/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Atlas&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, the Circulatronics platform starts with an injectable swarm of sub-cellular sized wireless electronic devices, or “SWEDs,” which can travel into inflamed regions of the patient’s brain after being injected into the bloodstream. They do so by fusing with living immune cells, called monocytes, forming a sort of cellular cyborg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;After they’ve been injected, the SWEDs then follow the “natural trafficking” of the immune cells to &lt;a href="https://www.americanbrainfoundation.org/what-is-neuroinflammation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sites of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, which play a significant role in many neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Once at the target area, the SWEDs embed in the inflamed part of the brain, where they deliver “electrical modulation” — basically tiny electrical shocks — in an effort to deliver signals that otherwise wouldn’t get through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In their paper, the researchers claim Circulatronics could be used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, strokes, brain tumors, spinal injuries, and more. The team says they’ve successfully implanted the experimental SWEDs in a rodent brain, which they could then control wirelessly to provide electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;If it works out in human patients, the researchers hope Circulatronics could expand treatment of brain regions which are typically expensive, difficult, and dangerous to treat with traditional surgery. (&lt;em&gt;New Atlas&lt;/em&gt; reports that Circulatronics will probably take another &lt;a href="https://orbit.mit.edu/launchpad/ideas/cahira-technologies" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;three years&lt;/a&gt; to even enter clinical trials.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The cool part, the study’s lead author Deblina Sarkar explains in a video, is that “this technology is not just confined to the brain, but could also be extended to other parts of the body in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-63475-2&amp;amp;articleId=b2863711&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;new research from the University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; suggests a certain type of &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; could be more powerful in preventing these conditions than previously thought: vigorous-intensity activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new data found vigorous-intensity activity to be six times more effective at lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease than moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, lead author Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis tells me. In other words, for every one minute of vigorous-intensity activity you do, you would need to do six minutes of a moderate-intensity activity to have the same impact on heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diabetes, it’s nine times more effective, and for all-cause mortality and cancer it’s a little bit lower,” Professor Stamatakis adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “vigorous-intensity activity” is relative – depending on factors such as your age and fitness level, it could mean anything from a swim or cycle to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout. The telltale signs are; your heart is beating fast; you are breathing hard to the point you can’t speak in full sentences; you can’t maintain this intensity for more than a few minutes at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can reach this intensity a few times per week, you can reduce your risk of chronic illness, the University of Sydney’s study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vigorous-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The signs of vigorous intensity will be very clear. For a non-athlete aged 30 and up who doesn’t do much exercise, they shouldn’t be able to maintain this intensity for more than two to three minutes without a break. It will be a significant effort, you will be getting out of breath and your heart will be pounding. You should be able to talk, but only say a few words at a time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘You will feel slightly out of breath – you can talk and hold a discussion, but you can’t sing comfortably because your respiratory system is quite engaged. There is a certain level of exertion, but you can sustain this for many minutes or even hours.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Light physical activity is any very low-intensity activity where you are moving but your heart rate is barely raised, such as a slow walk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity like brisk walking, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity like faster running or HIIT, or an equivalent of both. These physical activity guidelines have been widely adopted by the likes of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new research, published in the Nature journal, challenges the implicit 2:1 benefit ratio of the two intensities, suggesting you might need less vigorous-intensity activity or more moderate-intensity activity than previously thought to achieve the same health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We make a lot of fuss about the intensity of physical activity in our research because, firstly, different intensities have different health effects, and secondly, the higher the intensity, the higher the health value usually is,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest study used wearable data from 73,485 UK participants to assess the health impacts of light, moderate and vigorous activity against a selection of specific health outcomes; cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health outcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of vigorous-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from moderate-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from light activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;94 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.8 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;72.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major adverse cardiovascular events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;86.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-cause mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;52.7 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;156.2 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious conclusion here is that a time-efficient exercise routine should hinge on vigorous-intensity activity. If you prefer moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, you can use these to obtain similar health benefits, but the time commitment required for the same gains will be considerably greater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, no amount of light activity, like a slow walk, can replicate “some of the core physiological responses from vigorous-intensity activity”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to light activity, some movement is better than none,” Professor Stamatakis explains. “Moving around instead of sitting down is good for metabolic disease and energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when it comes to functional capacity, and cardiorespiratory fitness in particular, you need intensity to challenge your physiology. Vigorous-intensity activity will force the heart to strengthen its muscle, improving its capacity to pump blood. Very few of these things happen with light intensity activity, even in large amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-intensity-heart-health-b2856019.html"&gt;The thing most people get wrong when exercising – and why it’s costing them results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314624"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to exercise for maximum health benefits, based on this research &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to people who don’t do any vigorous-intensity activity as part of their day-to-day routines, introducing anything – even four to five minutes per day – seems to have some effect long term,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relates to another paper he co-authored earlier this year. The research found that five to 10 short daily bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (or VILPA), such as climbing the stairs or carrying heavy shopping, can significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature death in less active populations. These bouts of VILPA can be accrued through 60-second bursts of physically challenging activities during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to achieving lifelong benefits is to make these active behaviours into a habit, Professor Stamatakis asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not talking about doing it once a week or whenever you remember, we’re talking about a daily behaviour,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those currently living a sedentary lifestyle are the most likely to see significant benefits from introducing short bouts of vigorous-intensity activities into each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone does no vigorous-intensity activity, very little moderate-intensity activity – let’s say 15 minutes or less – and a few hours of light activity per day, that’s a very sedentary individual,” Professor Stamatakis says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, they will do under 5,000 or 6,000 steps per day. A very sedentary non-bedridden person – someone who does no planned physical activity, just essential movements like going to the car to drive to work, going to the supermarket for food or going to the bathroom – will accumulate about 4,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For such an individual, if they aim to incorporate seven short bursts of vigorous activity per day, or if you go by this study the equivalent is 63 minutes of moderate activity, they will lower their risk of health outcomes like cardiovascular diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bAxvyM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314625"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealer’s choice, and why vigorous-intensity activity is not for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is not to impose vigorous-intensity activity across all populations. Rather, it aims to provide people with more strings to their bow when creating an effective and sustainable exercise routine for fending off chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are short on time, vigorous-intensity physical activity can help you maximise exercise efficiency, particularly if you use short bursts of challenging lifestyle activities like climbing the stairs and carrying heavy shopping. These acts can also familiarise you with the feeling of a workout, paving the way for more formal exercise later down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this approach won’t work for everyone. Pushing people into a type of exercise they don’t enjoy can leave a “bad taste in their mouth”, souring their relationship with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher the intensity, the more discomfort comes with it,” says Professor Stamatakis. “We know this discomfort is a reason why some people quit exercise – because they don’t enjoy it. This is especially true in the population we’re interested in, which is physically inactive people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, moderate-intensity activity is a good alternative. You will have to devote more time to it – even more than previously thought, this latest study suggests – but it could be a more sustainable and enjoyable approach for certain people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone cannot do vigorous activity, or they can’t integrate it into their day-to-day routine for whatever reason, what is the point of prescribing and advocating vigorous intensity?” Professor Stamatakis asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that a very sedentary 60- or 70-year-old gentleman may enjoy going to the park with their grandchildren or going for a slow walk with a friend and chatting – that’s absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to be considerate and respectful towards people’s preferences; you have to acknowledge their circumstances and, considering everything, support them in the best possible way to integrate activity into their days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point here is to give people as many options as possible, hoping that one of them will be the option they can stick with. It’s all about establishing habits – not doing things once a week or once a month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/polyphenols-benefits-and-anti-ageing-effects-b2831125.html"&gt;Experts say including more of this in your diet can help you live a longer, healthier life - and it’s not protein or fibre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQTWtmbDBJX3NYcUFjLUdCbzZjZ0JnRkgxMy1kTHI4b0dPc29wYVYzS3FadEtjX2hwMGJHemJoU0FsNldaRl9RcmNvbTEzVGczYjhFY2R6VWNmaUVBeHRvRU5iaHNZSEJmZ3VkOFhqb2pNalp0Vkdoc0h6aE9GUlJ6Ym5DRmpDZ0w5aGkwa3pfaXlkay0zWTBjTHFnMC02OVg3TGJvenQxbHBmc0E</guid></item><item><title>饮食不健康和久坐不动的生活方式是导致心脏病发作的主要原因-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-things-other-that-eating-unhealthy-and-a-sedentary-lifestyle-which-contribute-majorly-to-heart-attacks-in-most-people/articleshow/125362611.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks continue to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical treatments and technologies. To help prevent such lethal heart conditions, such as stroke, attack or cardiac arrest, cardiologists usually pay much attention to maintaining blood pressure, cholesterol, and other conventional risk factors within normal limits. According to Dr. Dimitry Yaranov, a well-respected heart transplant cardiologist, the key to preventing heart attacks deserves much greater dedication to fundamental life and holistic health principles. Following are the first things he would never do when it comes to preventing heart attacks, with respect to the management of hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Never neglect the cornerstone of heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yaranov insists that the building blocks of heart health include so much more than just numbers of blood pressure and cholesterol. Among the cardinal rules he lives by is never to disregard key components such as quality sleep, stress management, clean air, and gut health. These are closely related to cardiovascular health and blood pressure. Poor sleep, for example, disrupts the normal nocturnal blood pressure dip, increasing the risk for hypertension and heart disease. Emotional and chronic stress causes inflammation and raises blood pressure, silently hurting the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ignoring these factors for the sake of medication or isolated lab results does more harm than good. A comprehensive approach to sleep hygiene, mental wellbeing, and environmental quality becomes crucial in the prevention of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid extreme or restrictive diets&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While managing hypertension and heart disease, nutrition plays an important role. Dr. Yaranov cautions against extreme diets, such as very high-protein or carnivore diets, which some might assume are heart-healthy merely because they reduce carbohydrate intake. These diets can elevate LDL cholesterol and provoke systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of artery blockage and cardiovascular events, even in young and otherwise fit individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, his approach advocates for balanced diets rich in nutrients, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Such diets not only help to regulate blood pressure but also reduce oxidative stress and support the gut microbiome, a vital, often overlooked player in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Never push through chronic stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is understandable when people today try to "push through" heavy schedules and emotional loads. According to Dr. Yaranov, this attitude is not good for heart health. Stress raises blood pressure temporarily, but frequently enough to cause chronic hypertension and inflammation-major risk factors for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mindfulness, meditation, physical activity, and adequate rest are some of the effective stress management techniques that he should not miss out on in his heart attack prevention strategy. It is also important to say “no” when overwhelmed and set boundaries to reduce emotional overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Effect of gut microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging research is showing that many aspects of cardiovascular health, including blood pressure, are influenced by gut microbiome. Dr. Yaranov would never neglect gut health in planning heart attack prevention strategies. A diet high in fiber, fermented foods, and prebiotics helps maintain an appropriate gut flora balance to help modulate blood pressure and lower systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conversely, poor gut health could contribute to hypertension and vascular disease by promoting inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. It is thus important that digestive well-being be prioritized in holistic heart care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid unmonitored medication use&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While moderate consumption of alcohol may have some cardiovascular benefits, binge drinking-even occasionally-can result in subtle vascular damage and sharply raise blood pressure, increasing the risk for heart attacks. Dr. Yaranov says to avoid such patterns at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, unmonitored intake of medications or supplements that raise blood pressure can undermine heart health efforts. The communication between patients with hypertension and their health care providers should be open regarding all drugs taken by them, since certain key medications such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and some stimulants may raise blood pressure or lead to fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Embracing holistic care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of it, Dr. Yaranov's guiding principle is to treat the patients and not to get better numbers on a blood pressure machine. To offer a personalised approach that includes balanced nutrition, lifestyle interventions and promoting sleep and emotional health, judicious use of medication and regular follow-up, all of which are essential for vascular health and heart function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAJBVV95cUxQUEdMcjJqMkIzbUYxd3pyUVNnZWNweWhsY08yZlFwZ3UySER1dVJPLVVpNGZSOUJ4eXFVZUZQblZJRUk0UE1sWnJSMDkxNmx6eEJBUFRyNG5jbl92aVlzYTdRZmh6TnkwMWhFVHBXS0FHZ3ljOEJLQjRIUm9iY01aeVB3Q2IxLWVKRVcwRmxvc1dlWVpsVUdaVlB0OUFaMFJyeHZMc3hBN29vWkZTLWFsQWNCNGEwZzd1QmJ5WnI3N2dSY19iZU1zbDdlTUxub2tsM1AzcnV6dW4xdWw4LTVZQl93T2FBM0kyd0FIRlJEa2tiakEwanZxdUFGRlRyY1dzUU5PNWJyWWVmeVpjZ1pObjRlNmpOSGphZmk2eWg4RE5TZ1hRbERocGh5NjlJckNo</guid></item><item><title>阿波罗德里内分泌学家解释印度食物中隐藏的糖：即使是idli或poha也是一个问题...... |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-delhi-endocrinologist-explains-hidden-sugars-in-indian-foods-even-idli-poha-are-problem-when-paired-with-ketchup-101763286808328.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/apollo-delhi-endocrinologist-explains-hidden-sugars-in-indian-foods-even-idli-poha-are-problem-when-paired-with-ketchup-101763286808328.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered why you're feeling slaky or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/feeling-tired-all-day-doctor-warns-it-can-be-a-sign-of-iron-deficiency-suggests-ways-to-boost-iron-levels-101762345266782.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="tired all the time"&gt;tired all the time&lt;/a&gt;?

But sugar is not just in dessert — it quietly hides in many of our everyday Indian foods. From breakfast dishes to snacks and drinks, hidden sugars can easily push your daily intake beyond healthy limits, leading to sudden sugar spikes and long-term risks like diabetes, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/shark-tanks-namita-thapar-48-shares-how-she-copes-with-perimenopause-weight-gain-i-work-out-6-days-a-week-101756099137642.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="weight gain"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, and fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bhattacharya, many common foods we eat every day contain more sugar than we realise:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Breakfast items: “Popular choices like &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kokilaben-hospital-gastroenterologist-explains-how-your-morning-milk-tea-could-silently-harm-your-gut-and-liver-101761880109103.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="chai with sugar"&gt;chai with sugar&lt;/a&gt;, flavoured cornflakes, or sweetened yoghurt can cause you to start your day with 3–5 teaspoons of sugar. Even idli or poha become a problem when paired with ketchup or packaged chutneys that contain added sugar,” Dr Bhattacharya said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Snacks: “Packaged namkeens, biscuits, instant noodles, and bakery items like pav or buns often contain refined sugar to enhance flavour and shelf life,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Indian gravies: “Many restaurant-style curries and sauces — like butter chicken, paneer butter masala, or korma — use tomato ketchup, cream, or sweetened pastes that add hidden sugar,” he shared&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;⦿ Drinks: Soft drinks, bottled fruit juices, milkshakes, energy drinks, and even 'healthy' packaged lassi or flavoured milk can contain 5-8 teaspoons or 20-30 gm of sugar per serving, as per Dr Bhattacharya.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Street food: “Chaats, samosa chole, and pani puri often use sweet chutneys and syrups. Over time, these sugars add up and cause chronic calorie surplus that results in fat deposition and obesity,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/16/original/Gemini_Generated_Image_jynkdvjynkdvjynk_1763286924347.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eating too much hidden sugar can cause your blood sugar to spike, increasing the risk of diabetes, belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation.

(Made using Gemini AI)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What hidden sugars do to your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming high amounts of hidden sugars can lead to a rapid rise in blood glucose levels, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-reveals-6-signs-you-might-have-insulin-resistance-increased-belly-fat-cravings-for-carbs-sugar-thirst-101754709377512.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="insulin resistance"&gt;insulin resistance &lt;/a&gt;and type 2 diabetes, and belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation. “Hidden sugars cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels, followed by a sudden drop that leaves you tired and craving more sugar. Over time, this cycle increases the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Even if you’re not diabetic, excess sugar contributes to belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation,” Dr Bhattacharya said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to cut down on hidden sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bhattacharya, you don’t have to give up your favourite foods — just make small, mindful changes. Here is what he suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Read labels carefully: Packaged foods often list sugar under names like sucrose, glucose syrup, maltose, or dextrose. The shorter the ingredient list, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Limit sweetened beverages: Replace bottled drinks with fresh nimbu pani (lemon water), unsweetened coconut water, or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/delhi-dietician-reveals-why-herbal-tea-is-better-than-chai-during-pollution-season-suggests-which-ones-work-the-best-101763018962797.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="herbal teas"&gt;herbal teas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Cook at home: When you prepare your own gravies, you can skip the ketchup or cream and use fresh tomato puree, yoghurt, or nuts for texture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Balance your meals: Combine carb-heavy dishes like rice, poha, or chapati with fibre and protein—like vegetables, lentils, or paneer — to slow sugar absorption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;⦿ Watch portion sizes: Even traditional sweets can be enjoyed occasionally—just limit to small portions and eat them after a balanced meal, not on an empty stomach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Bhattacharya concluded: “The key isn’t to stop enjoying Indian food — it’s to make it smarter. Choose fresh ingredients, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/signalling-health-in-packaged-food-space-101756738619194.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="reduce packaged and restaurant meals"&gt;reduce packaged and restaurant meals&lt;/a&gt;, and be conscious of how sugar sneaks into your plate. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;When you take control of what goes into your food, you protect your energy levels, your blood sugar, and your long-term health — one mindful bite at a time.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

              &lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Gabi McCord paces her kitchen. Crayon drawings are pinned to the fridge, shelves are cluttered with picture frames, and little shoes sit on a rack near the door. She stirs together pancake mix, heavy cream, and a heaping spoonful of cinnamon. Then she puts bite-sized pieces on her baby's high chair tray and drizzles maple syrup on the stacks for the older two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a scene so ordinary it's hard to imagine how fragile it is. And how quickly a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-31-diagnosed-colon-cancer-despite-being-fit-and-healthy-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diagnosis would shift everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I call Gabi, it's often in moments like this, with her kids giggling on the other side of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go watch 'Paw Patrol' with your brother. I'm making us something to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shhhh,&lt;/em&gt; babe. Mommy's on the phone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love you, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabi's last few years have been a whirlwind — a surprise pregnancy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-today-newsletter-cancer-diagnosis-healthcare-ai-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer at 35&lt;/a&gt;, treatment, recovery, motherhood, marriage, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cancer-made-me-a-better-manager-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, and an uncertain path forward.

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I missed out on bonding with my son after he was born. There was a moment recently that I remember looking at him and bursting out in tears, like, 'You're my baby, You're mine,'" Gabi, now 37, said. "Cancer meant that certain things didn't quite register, and life was happening around me. I was sitting down in a cinema watching myself. Now I'm pressing the pause button and looking at each scene."&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cases are rising for people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, derailing finances and future plans at a pivotal stage of life. Dozens of patients have told us they're navigating relationships, fertility decisions, early parenthood, and career growth alongside treatment. They're paying medical bills and for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/james-van-der-beek-colon-cancer-symptom-diagnosis-screening-shield-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;all the unexpected costs&lt;/a&gt; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But young cancer doesn't just affect patients.

              &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Gabi was at a routine check-up near her Houston home when the gynecologist first mentioned that something looked off. The results of her 2023 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/at-home-pap-smear-wand-approved-fda-teal-health-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Pap smear&lt;/a&gt;, along with weeks of pelvic pain and spotting between periods, had raised concern for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up that spring, the doctor noticed changes to her cervix and paused mid-exam. Before they could do further diagnostics, she needed to take a pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The morning blurred after that. Gabi remembers stepping into a Walgreens as rain poured across the parking lot. She stood in the family planning aisle, whispering a prayer, and reached for an electronic test — the ones that spell out PREGNANT in big, unmistakable letters. It was an extra $3, but it felt worth the splurge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nine months after that positive test, Gabi and her husband, Johnathon Shufford, lived in a kind of suspended reality. She has three teenagers from a prior relationship, and this would be her third baby with Johnathon.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The couple &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-you-should-wait-to-have-a-baby-economy-tariffs-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prepared a nursery&lt;/a&gt; for their youngest child, picked a name, and held on to hope — counting down the weeks until doctors could safely perform a biopsy to find out if she had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, they welcomed a healthy baby boy. He was barely 2 months old when Gabi had a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/abnormal-pap-smear" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cervical cone&lt;/a&gt;, a procedure that confirmed her diagnosis of stage 3C1 cervical cancer. He had just hit 4 months when she returned to the hospital for a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-need-hysterectomy-struggling-emotionally-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;radical hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt; and lymph node dissection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when things became real for Johnathon. He remembers shifting from newborn pediatrician visits to the oncology ward. "It's very scary when you think about losing your wife," he said. The daily nerves he had during Gabi's pregnancy grew into a crushing devastation that he tried to hide. "I didn't want her to see me down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the couple clung to routines — grocery runs, laundry, baby bottles. Gabi would wake up early to drop off their daughter and older son at day care on her way to the office, where she worked in insurance sales. Johnathon would pick them up each afternoon and get them settled at home before his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shift-workers-struggle-find-childcare-9-to-5-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;evening shift as a truck driver&lt;/a&gt;. Her two rounds of chemotherapy and six rounds of radiation were tucked into the family schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1763149921965" data-styles="breakout-width" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="https://tbimedia.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bistudios/_00/dev_edit/graphics/2025/10/2025-10-YoungCancer-Modules/index.js" class="insider-raw-embed breakout" data-type="embed"&gt;&lt;figure data-chart="yc10"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
          
          
          
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it grew harder to relish the sweet moments of normalcy, and costs were piling up. Numbers came one by one, and were rarely dramatic on their own:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$48 for each can of formula because breastfeeding during chemo wasn't safe;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$30-plus copays&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for each visit to the oncologist, OBGYN, or neurologist; $13 for each bottle of Advil; and $2.80 for each gallon of gas burned driving back and forth to the doctor. Each expense felt small until it wasn't — until the sum began to look like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/24-year-old-diagnosed-stage-3-colon-cancer-subtle-symptom-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;a diagnosis they couldn't afford to treat&lt;/a&gt;. Even with insurance, the medical bills totaled thousands and thousands of dollars. Gabi winced when she paid $60 for the occasional manicure to feel like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receipts mirror what researchers are documenting nationwide. Medical debt is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/medical-bankruptcies" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;top cause of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; analysis with Business Insider found that working-age cancer patients can spend about $45,000 out-of-pocket in the first year of diagnosis, between treatment, lost wages,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insurance-fertility-ivf-costs-hsa-millennial-couple-infertility-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt; fertility care&lt;/a&gt;, and unexpected costs. It's the hidden math of survival: how even insured people like Gabi watch cancer quietly drain their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Many newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients are balancing motherhood alongside work and treatment, said Dr. Andrea Tufano-Sugarman, a gynecologic oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Cases are rising for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2025/2025-cancer-facts-and-figures-acs.pdf" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;women in their 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt;, she said, and "I try to brainstorm with my patients what they might need in terms of getting childcare, dinner, and the logistics of all that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Gabi, treatment was extracting its own tax. Beyond fatigue and nausea, she was going through &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/going-through-early-menopause-feels-lonely-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;early menopause&lt;/a&gt;, and feeling hot all the time made it harder to hold her kids. She struggled to fall asleep at night, prepare meals, drive to the office, and manage the rhythm of the household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she developed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/father-peripheral-neuropathy-nerve-damage-condition-navigating-fatherhood-work-health-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;peripheral neuropathy &lt;/a&gt;in late 2024, a side effect of radiation that caused numbness and nerve damage, she could barely celebrate that her cancer scans were clear. She could no longer feel her legs, and doctors couldn't predict if the paralysis would be permanent. Johnathon carried his wife up and down the stairs of their second-floor rental apartment each time they went outside. She resigned from her insurance job soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever he had a question, Johnathon watched YouTube. He asked the search bar how to cook easy dinner recipes, properly fold a wheelchair, and style his toddlers' hair in the morning. He had quickly become the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/being-sole-breadwinner-family-important-lessons-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sole earner and primary parent&lt;/a&gt;, and his own mental health started to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your spouse gets cancer, it's almost like you have it too," he said. "You may not have it physically, but mentally, if you truly love your spouse, there's going to be a lot of times that you feel really bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids — who are now 1, 4, and 6 — are too little to understand cancer and the gravity of it all. That brings Gabi some relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;When I visited Gabi in late August, she had just started walking again. She joked about her swollen feet and one of the few shoes that fit — a pair of chunky New Balance sneakers. She pointed to the compression device she uses for her legs and the glittery hot-pink wheelchair folded in the corner of her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we drove to get lunch through Houston's heat, the conversation turned to paperwork. Getting a blue &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-unemployment-hiring-workers-with-disabilities-cap-report-2022-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;disability permit&lt;/a&gt; for her car has taken months and a stack of forms thicker than her medical file. She said she constantly has to prove to the government, insurance company, and strangers that she still needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"I style my hair and wear makeup and stuff, and I do it to feel good. But the flip side of that is that people seeing me don't believe me," Gabi sighed. That's part of why she still keeps her wheelchair folded in the trunk because "it's really hard when people can't see your disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he needed help the most, Johnathon said Candice Julien and Chineva Smith — Gabi's sister and cousin — were "angels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient isn't the only person that goes through this traumatic experience," Chineva said. "Hope was literally the size of a mustard seed, just pulling us through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candice, a 34-year-old federal employee in Maryland, flew cross-country twice a month to hold Gabi's hand and sent care packages when she couldn't be there in person. Her two children are elementary age, so she traded off days of remote work, PTO, and childcare with her husband, often flying their kids back and forth to Texas. She's in thousands of dollars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-credit-card-gen-z-high-levels-debt-spending-points-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;credit card debt&lt;/a&gt; from travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chineva is a professor in Houston. The 37-year-old, who has two teenagers, spent hundreds of dollars on groceries, baby supplies, pajamas, and car seats to make sure her young niece and nephews were comfortable. A stack of diapers still sits in the backseat of her car, "just in case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout her treatment, Gabi said she had no idea how scared her loved ones felt. They laughed with her, prayed with her, picked up snacks from Target when they all grew tired of hospital food, and promised her everything would turn out all right. They privately worried it wouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five percent of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lessons-learned-end-of-life-planning-when-mother-died-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer caregivers&lt;/a&gt; developed poor mental health during their loved one's treatment and a third felt significant grief, a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10950200/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;2024 survey&lt;/a&gt; of a few hundred caregivers found. They're at a high risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder — especially women, who shoulder most of the care load in the US. Paola Zambrana of the Caregiver Action Network emphasized that caregivers also navigate a loved one's treatment around limited PTO, complex finances, and parenting responsibilities, which is "a part of mental health that isn't really spoken about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not OK, and honestly, I don't think I ever will be," Candice said, adding, "Sometimes you just have to show up."&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Cancer has shifted everyone's plans for the future. Gabi's scans have been clear for nearly a year, though she worries about what recurrence would mean for her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her marriage has become strained; she and Johnathon started couples therapy this fall. The financial impact of cancer means they &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-first-time-homebuyers-real-estate-disappearing-losing-baby-boomers-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;can't afford the down payment&lt;/a&gt; on the house they've dreamed of and will spend a few more years renting. Gabi said that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-get-medical-bills-reduced-negotiate-challenge-payment-plan-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;medical debt&lt;/a&gt; has also tanked her credit score. "Now we're having a lot of conversations," she said.

The couple feels like they're constantly getting new bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Gabi returned to an insurance sales job. She worries that she won't have enough energy for a 9-to-5, but she said she needs her own income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the chaos came a kind of clarity. If she couldn't control her body or her bank account, she could control what came next — and how she used her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabi is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Public Health, with a focus on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-struggle-afford-healthcare-medicaid-low-income-black-hispanic-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;health inequities&lt;/a&gt; that affect communities of color.

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Her sanctuary has become a garden-level room adorned with fairy lights and flowers. In this "room of peace," Gabi prays like she does in a pew on Sundays. She wraps herself in the bubblegum pink blanket she brought to every chemo appointment and updates the family calendar with holidays, birthdays, and playdates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day, I get to wake up and hold my kids," she said. "I try not to dwell on the shit that could have happened, but I look at my baby and my family and my husband, and I see what it would have been like if they had to walk behind my casket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family has their own ideas about moving forward. Chineva plans to write children's books about grief and has become diligent about her own &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/easy-at-home-colon-cancer-screening-tests-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;preventive health screenings&lt;/a&gt;. Candice hopes to live closer to her sister someday and take her on a beach vacation. Johnathon looks forward to supporting his kids' hobbies as they grow. They still ask for cinnamon pancakes three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning I visited Gabi, we stopped by the hospital for her first visit since she had relearned how to walk. She hummed along to Britney Spears while we drove down US-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are you feeling?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excited, mostly," she answered.&lt;/p&gt;
