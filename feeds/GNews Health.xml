Plastics have improved modern life in countless ways, but the ultimate price of this convenience is only now coming clearly into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reached the point as a society where researchers have begun looking beyond the environmental hazards of plastic pollution to uncover hidden connections between plastic exposure and human well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions are emerging about how microplastics might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-chewing-gum-may-be-full-of-microplastics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;affecting our bodies&lt;/a&gt; and whether this is something we should address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday items, such as water bottles, may contribute far more than trash. They could be releasing tiny plastic particles that slip into our bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies suggest that plastic particles are influencing human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/study-reveals-over-2000-genetic-markers-that-affect-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a condition linked to serious cardiovascular problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Johanna Fischer from the Department of Medicine at &lt;a href="https://www.dp-uni.ac.at/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danube Private University&lt;/a&gt; in Austria, a few recent findings have sparked new debates about what happens when microplastics flow through our bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-pieces-of-plastic-wreaking-havoc"&gt;Tiny pieces of plastic wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics measure less than 5 mm, arising from the breakdown of larger plastics or from everyday sources like car tires and synthetic clothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been detected in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food, water, and the air&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have identified them in the placenta, in certain organs, and even in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their presence has raised concerns because they might trigger inflammation or hormonal imbalances. By entering daily routines unnoticed, these microscopic bits could pose health hazards that are still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work has pointed to an unexpected culprit for high blood pressure. Their investigations indicate that common water bottles can release particles into the liquid we drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary insights, microplastics can migrate into our system, with potential effects on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-smell-control-your-blood-pressure-new-research-says-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure measurements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators also discovered these minute fragments in glass containers, which complicates efforts to avoid them altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a wider issue that stretches beyond visible waste and calls for innovative approaches to monitoring exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-linked-to-blood-pressure"&gt;Plastics linked to blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight healthy adults took part in a project aimed at exploring any links between plastics and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were asked to rely on tap water instead of bottled drinks for about a month. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; readings were collected at the outset, after two weeks, and at the end of four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that women showed a noticeable dip in blood pressure levels, particularly in diastolic readings, while men did not exhibit the same changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation might be that only three men participated. That small number makes it difficult to form broad conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the overall data hint that cutting back on plastics could influence cardiovascular health by reducing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; present in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research group emphasizes that larger trials are needed. They aim to measure the actual concentration of microplastics in the blood, providing a clearer picture of how plastic exposure might relate to changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-and-plastics-the-results"&gt;Blood pressure and plastics – the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We concluded, after extensive research, that beverages packaged in plastic bottles should be avoided,” the research team warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes observed in blood pressure suggest that reducing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-the-brain-alarming-new-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake of plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; could lower cardiovascular risk, emphasizing how these findings may fit into the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these scientists, a lower exposure to plastics seems to correlate with improvements in some blood pressure markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stating that “plastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-found-in-every-semen-sample-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;present in the bloodstream&lt;/a&gt; could contribute to increased blood pressure,” the team highlighted a potential link between microplastics and cardiovascular concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although their study involved only a small group, they view the results as a motivation to investigate these interactions further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the precise pathways remain unclear, the prospect that tiny plastic fragments might affect blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health should encourage us all to rethink these common habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because hypertension is a leading cause of heart complications, any factor that might raise blood pressure deserves scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans already face multiple risks for cardiovascular disease, so identifying one that might be avoidable is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting bottled beverages or opting for tap water in reusable non-plastic containers will definitely help reduce exposure, though additional verification is needed to confirm the long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing many different studies, it’s very clear that microplastics have infiltrated every nook and cranny of our bodies, natural environments, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sounding-the-alarm-microplastics-are-disrupting-photosynthesis-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global ecosystems at large&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular health issues that arise from the consumption of microplastics, scientists and physicians are concerned about inflammation, endocrine problems, and oxidative stress, all of which can harm overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the convenience of disposable products is tempting, making a personal choice of removing single-use plastics from our everyday lives will undoubtedly yield benefits – both for our health and the global environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8929/3/3/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

Using PET imaging, they found that dopamine levels spike in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when people switch between tasks — and the more dopamine released, the more efficiently they adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms a biochemical link between dopamine and the brain’s ability to adjust behavior in response to changing demands. The discovery may help refine treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia, which often impair flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine &amp;amp; Adaptability:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher dopamine release correlates with better task switching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Region Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; PET scans showed dopamine activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may guide treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired cognitive flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SNMMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, scientists have confirmed a neurobiochemical link between dopamine and cognitive flexibility, according to new research published in the March issue of &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging shows that the brain increases dopamine production when completing cognitively demanding tasks, and that the more dopamine released, the more efficiently the tasks are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108271"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this information, physicians may soon be able to develop more precise treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to adapt one’s thinking and behavior appropriately to a changing environment and is considered an aspect of executive function. Cognitive flexibility differs among people and is reported to be impaired in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown,” said Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in experimental nuclear medicine in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real-time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen participants were scanned with the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in a two-part block study design. In the first part, participants performed two tasks consecutively on a computer screen without rule switching while undergoing PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the PET scan, participants had to switch flexibly between two task rules. Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging analysis showed a displacement of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the task switching (higher cognitive demand) part of the study, which is assumed to be the release of dopamine. Results also showed that the greater dopamine release, the more efficient participants were in switching between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present findings emphasize the significance of dopamine in cognitive flexibility,” said Mathias Schreckenberger, MD, head of the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are consistent with the results of previous clinical studies indicating that dopamine deficiency in disorders such as Parkinson’s disease may cause behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking forward, it is expected that the results of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and thus facilitate the development of treatment strategies to improve flexibility in neurological and psychiatric disorders,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f7e8e4fde0fcc5f6ebe8e8ecabeaf7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rebecca Maxey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://snmmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNMMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rebecca Maxey – SNMMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.124.268317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Isabelle Miederer et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to appropriately adapt one’s thinking and behavior to changing environmental demands and is conceptualized as an aspect of executive function. The dopamine system has been implicated in cognitive flexibility; however, a direct, that is, neurochemical, link to cognitive flexibility has not been shown yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate how cognitive flexibility is mediated by dopaminergic signaling in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eighteen participants were measured in a PET study with 174 ± 12 MBq of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in a block design with 2 parts. While participants processed 2 tasks sequentially without rule switching on a computer screen in the first part of the PET scan, they had to flexibly switch between the 2 task rules after 100 min after injection in the second part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine release (γ) was quantified using the linearized simplified reference region model contrasting the 2 task blocks (switching vs. no-switching/baseline). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The statistical analysis of the parametric γ-images showed that the increased cognitive demand during task switching induced a displacement of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in the vmPFC (maximum T value = 13.8; cluster size: 528 voxels; familywise error rate–corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; mean γ = 0.022 ± 0.006 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, a correlation between behavioral switch costs and vmPFC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride displacement suggested that participants showing greater dopamine release were more efficient in task switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; To our knowledge, this is the first experimental PET study to show direct involvement of dopamine in the vmPFC in a task-switching paradigm, confirming model assumptions about the neurochemical basis of cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:32:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1sZUlteXlHOFp6dDFZM1JpcE9UdF95c0lfZDVWTkEteDlpeUhTQ29mRXR3TU1XSWJIcTJITUl1RkZWTmlvcjhFdGdXZWdVLWNFWU5XektoUllVRGpxOXlzRnNqVlZGb2J5SWVVUWVOa2Y2OGJE</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.’s Faulty Advice On Bird Flu - FactCheck.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9pZVJyMnE0MUdNZTBiVF9oZ0JFTndRVzFiWXdTek4yNTRjaE5Yd3daN2pma1hjYTRudXFxOW8zUGwycmZJZXhnX25QRE9VRk54cUNjTUhwSm1vdUZpcVMwQVdTM2puNXZIN3RaQzFwNTBsN3M3akQtWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo estará disponible en español &lt;a href="https://eltiempolatino.com/author/factcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;en El Tiempo Latino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent news appearances, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; has suggested allowing bird flu to spread in poultry flocks unchecked. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that’s risky because it gives the virus more opportunities to replicate, increasing the chance it could change to spread easily among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/05/qa-on-h5n1-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spreading&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. dairy cows for more than a year now and has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; several dozen dairy workers. The virus also has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/YHEcz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; flocks of chickens and other poultry in the U.S. since 2022, leading to the deaths of more than 168 million birds, infections in poultry workers and high &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/qa-on-egg-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;egg prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We’ve in fact said to [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of bird flu in an &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. The conversation aired March 4 on Fox Nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of our scientists are against the culling operation,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox News March 11. Kennedy advocated testing therapeutics in flocks and again suggested looking for birds with “a genetic inclination for immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have acknowledged that culling on its own &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-26/poultry-culling-hasnt-stopped-h5n1-bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has not stopped&lt;/a&gt; bird flu from infecting poultry. But they &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/birdflu/114731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; is risky and unlikely to yield a breakthrough in the search for bird flu therapeutics or genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone is going to say well, we should let the virus just go unchecked and follow RFK Jr.’s suggestion, we’re going to exacerbate the problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at University of California, Davis, Veterinary Medicine Cooperative Extension, told us. “There’s no scenario where that is a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why do we want to give the virus a leg up? Why do we want to give it an advantage and let it do its worst without being checked?” &lt;a href="https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/our-science/scientists/prof-ian-brown-obe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ian Brown&lt;/a&gt;, group leader of avian virology at the Pirbright Institute in the U.K., asked us. “That doesn’t feel terribly logical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letting bird flu run through poultry flocks is “not advisable and this will cause serious harm to poultry and put other animals at risk, but also humans who will have to manage the culling/clean-up, which poses a huge biosecurity risk,” &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/popescu-saskia/"&gt;Saskia Popescu&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy left out important context about the risk of bird flu. And he misleadingly claimed that vaccinating poultry would turn birds into “mutation factories,” when researchers say that vaccinating birds could be one possible way of mitigating agricultural harm and reducing risks to people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is in charge of HHS, not the USDA, so it is unclear how much his views will influence the policy on culling or vaccinating birds. On the human health side, lawmakers and scientists recently have raised concerns that HHS is threatening pandemic preparedness by pulling back &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;funding to states&lt;/a&gt; being used to control infectious disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;embarking on&lt;/a&gt; a massive reduction in HHS staff and reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reevaluating&lt;/a&gt; a contract for research into bird flu mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in a Feb. 26 Fox News &lt;a href="https://x.com/AmericaNewsroom/status/1894798813681827949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; indicated USDA might try out a pilot program to build a “safe perimeter” around some flocks to “see if there is a way forward where the immunity and the genetics and the DNA become part of this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the USDA affirmed to us via email that its policy is still to require culling. “The United States will continue to follow our established stamping out policy,” in keeping with international &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-do/standards/codes-and-manuals/terrestrial-code-online-access/?id=169&amp;amp;L=1&amp;amp;htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, an agency spokesperson said, and also will work to “develop innovative strategies (including alternative response activities) and ensure we use every tool at our disposal” to fight bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late February, the USDA &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HY0SY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $1 billion strategy to combat bird flu, which &lt;a href="https://archive.is/rSXDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; funds dedicated to developing vaccines for poultry and for improving biosecurity on farms. Good biosecurity can help prevent bird flu from being introduced to farms in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting Bird Flu Spread in Poultry Is Risky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;H5N1 bird flu — the type causing the current outbreak in the U.S. — spreads rapidly in chickens and is &lt;a href="https://archive.is/WhPDJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;highly lethal&lt;/a&gt;. USDA &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; is to kill all the birds in a flock once H5N1 is detected. This culling process, also referred to as depopulation, reduces bird flu’s ability replicate, mutate and spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Hannity, Kennedy blamed high egg prices on culling. “We’ve killed 166 million chickens,” Kennedy said. “That’s why we have an egg crisis.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But bird flu is the root cause of the bird deaths. These birds “would die anyway if they were not depopulated,” Brown said, explaining that the “lethality is pretty close to 100%.” The hens would stop laying eggs early in their infection, he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When infection is allowed to take its course, poultry “die quite a horrible death,” Brown said, so there is also an animal welfare issue with not culling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome of stopping culling, Pitesky said, would be more bird deaths as the virus spread unchecked, ultimately reducing the country’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The quicker you depopulate, the quicker you can prevent disease transmission from that facility to other facilities or to wild birds that are in that area that are then going to transmit the disease to other facilities,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping culling could increase the risk of bird flu changing in dangerous ways. “The more opportunities the virus has to replicate, the more opportunities it has to mutate and reassort with all kinds of different strains,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was also wrong to almost entirely blame bird flu cases in humans on culling. “Almost all of the people who have gotten sick were workers who were involved in the culling operations,” he told Siegel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s inaccurate,” Popescu said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 out of 70 U.S. human bird flu cases cave been in people &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; via poultry farms and culling operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been cases “related to culling, but this is also in relation to poultry exposure overall – culling is a necessary practice to avoid additional exposure (humans and animals), and frankly it’s a horrific illness for birds,” Popescu said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy Unlikely to Identify Flu-Resistant Chickens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that stopping culling in order to find resistant birds or new therapeutics was unlikely to be effective. “People have been trying to breed genetic lines that are resistant to flu for some years now and have generally failed to succeed,” Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been research into whether some birds might have genes that could provide flu resistance, Pitesky said, but this work is done in poultry being raised in villages in Africa and Asia that have more genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commercial chickens in the U.S. are bred to be as genetically identical as possible so that they will grow at the same rate, Pitesky added. These poultry are the “least ideal population” to test whether it’s possible to identify birds with genetic resistance to H5N1, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pitesky also said that before testing a therapeutic in the field, “you ultimately need some indication that it’s going to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is we don’t have anything in the pipeline right now, as far as I know, that there’s any indication it could be curative of a viral infection like this in poultry,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that there have been concerns about whether therapeutics for chickens could be cost-effective, “even if they could do the job, which I doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do think we do need to think outside the box, but that is not a viable outside-the-box scenario,” Pitesky said, referring to Kennedy’s proposal for finding resistant chickens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccinating Poultry Could Curb Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible way to protect chickens would be to vaccinate them, Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in his conversation with Hannity, Kennedy misleadingly dismissed vaccination as a strategy that could harm human health. “All of my agencies have advised against vaccination of birds because if you vaccinate with a leaky vaccine — in other words, a vaccine that does not provide sterilizing immunity, that does not absolutely protect against the disease — you turn those flocks into mutation factories,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that vaccination would reduce illness in birds and their ability to spread the virus. Bird flu vaccines do not completely prevent infection, and vaccination could favor versions of the virus that aren’t as well targeted by the vaccine. However, there isn’t evidence that vaccination would “generate some monster virus that can infect people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poultry vaccines are available, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/french-bird-flu-vaccine-campaign-helps-poultry-output-recover-producers-say-2025-02-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/02/17/bird-flu-vaccination-policies-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; Mexico, France, Egypt and China use vaccines against bird flu in poultry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “claim that poultry vaccination will ‘turn those birds into mutant factories’ is incorrect,” virologist &lt;a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/bmi-affiliated/angela-rasmussen.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Saskatchewan said in a social media &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/UQK8-UZ3T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination in China against another type of bird flu virus, H7N9, did &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/2DZB-6XUX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt; survival of flu genotypes that could evade the vaccine, she said. But researchers found that the “variants that emerged were less adapted to infect humans,” Rasmussen said, and &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/4J56-58X6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccinating&lt;/a&gt; the birds “basically stopped human infections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So yes, RNA viruses like flu can mutate &amp;amp; vaccination creates selection pressures driving their evolution,” Rasmussen &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/YJM4-JU2U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “But that doesn’t turn chickens into mutant factories &amp;amp; reduces the risk to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are policy and logistical &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/h5n1-bird-flu-egg-prices-former-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-biosecurity-vaccines-new-normal/"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinating chickens in the U.S. Brown explained, for instance, that some countries do not allow imports from countries that vaccinate their poultry. The laying industry in the U.S. does not have a substantial export business and is for vaccinating poultry. The meat industry, also called the broiler industry, exports large quantities of chicken and is against vaccination due to the trade embargoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we’ve written, USDA is funding vaccine research. In response to a March 26 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a39tYB91NJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from Forbes about Kennedy’s poultry vaccine comments, asked during an impromptu interview outside the White House, Rollins did not comment specifically but emphasized that multiple agencies would work together to curb bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://archive.is/E0l0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HV5qd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; currently consider the risk of H5N1 bird flu to the general public to be low. However, public health experts still &lt;a href="https://archive.is/ExJxs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people take precautions, such as avoiding raw milk and using caution around wild birds and other potentially infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also have emphasized that the risk level of bird flu &lt;a href="https://archive.is/5dlV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6k4.u3Jf.JV8nun8aMOP6&amp;amp;smid=url-share&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;change very quickly&lt;/a&gt; if the virus changes to more readily infect and spread among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy — who has advocated &lt;a href="https://archive.is/d1ImN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deregulating&lt;/a&gt; raw milk in the past — left out this context in talking about the food supply. “It’s not transmitted through eggs or through dairy products,” he told Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” he said to Hannity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no documented human cases of bird flu in the U.S. resulting from eating eggs, milk or meat. Birds with flu stop laying eggs early in the course of their infection, and the virus isn’t found in high amounts in eggs, Pitesky said. For eggs, “I’d be more concerned about salmonella than I would about avian influenza,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dairy is different,” Pitesky said, saying that raw milk is “dangerous,” both due to the potential presence of bird flu and due to other microbes. In cows, bird flu is found at the highest levels in the udder and milk. Pasteurization kills the bird flu virus, but it has been shown to persist in raw milk and raw milk products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats have &lt;a href="https://archive.is/f04HN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from H5N1 bird flu after drinking raw milk. “If someone is going to tell me, let’s wait until a human dies … I’m not willing to take that chance,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw meat pet foods have also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said that B3.13, the version of bird flu that spread to cows in late 2023, is “not very dangerous to humans,” adding that it “is not something that we’re deeply concerned about.” He said to Siegel that the D1.1 version of the virus, which has been found in wild birds and poultry and also recently spread to cow herds, is “more dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date, the B3.13 genotype has caused mild disease in humans. D1.1 and a related version of the virus, called D1.3, have led to &lt;a href="https://archive.is/kYP5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three severe bird flu cases&lt;/a&gt; in humans in the U.S., including one &lt;a href="https://archive.is/LrBi7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The severe cases occurred in two people with backyard &lt;a href="https://archive.is/SAl5P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; and one worker who was culling diseased poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, scientists cautioned against complacency in the response to any version of the virus. “It only needs to acquire a couple of mutations” to become more dangerous to humans, Brown said. “That risk profile might change.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologists like me are wary of drawing premature conclusions about severity,” Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in a recent New York Times &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;. She cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from small numbers of cases occurring largely in dairy workers, when people with high-risk health conditions or the very old or young might be underrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I fear that the apparent mildness of infections in the United States has confounded calls to act more decisively,” Rivers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An unvaccinated, but otherwise healthy child, died of measles in February, becoming the &lt;strong&gt;first measles fatality&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S. in a decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just two cases have occurred in people fully vaccinated, according to the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friday’s updates come after the Trump administration abruptly canceled more than &lt;strong&gt;$11 billion&lt;/strong&gt; in COVID-era public health grants, a move that state and local health departments said could harm Texas’s measles response.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Departments are already operating on &lt;strong&gt;thin margins&lt;/strong&gt; and need to balance sometimes competing public health priorities. Due to the loss, some health departments are already starting to cancel contracts and lay off workers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grants were used for information modernization, as well as to hire people to help with vaccinations, testing and disease tracking. But that work had to &lt;strong&gt;stop immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said &lt;strong&gt;grant money&lt;/strong&gt; was going to be used to help equip a new lab that is being built. The new equipment would have expanded the lab’s testing capacity for COVID-19, as well as other pathogens, like measles.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is going to stop work in its tracks that was really important for their communities,” said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“Work to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in nursing homes, for example, or to be able to track measles cases … the work has to stop, and yet the needs in the community remain,” Casalotti said.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNMGhlRlA3eFRieVdFX3F1SVBrQmR0blJlc2oxRHVkZW1wTDBDSnBLek9fOVlfWG9zQU1vT3pBNldCNmhmZW4wd19mZV9naE1BZVBFUzlQSjQ1OExLeHcxV2QwQ1ZIRVdnTUFEYnB2eDhEZUFMVHE0dXZJU1dxY3NDWjZxb2RzaTNvNmfSAY8BQVVfeXFMTUhLaTAxMWZleUtZeVg4cHIwNEVEY3BjdE1jS2F3QXUzXzZaTlhBOWNWN0RBRG5Yb3o4Y0FpSlJjYjgyUHhrTGZjNlJDOE0zaFgwM3o1Vk5CWU82dVVERHdWWjgzeGxJVU9EcTZoSWd5SWJXY01JdHZld0taUHVCOEN5MWVNeWx4SDYtXzFKdG8</guid></item><item><title>The CDC Buried a Measles Forecast That Stressed the Need for Vaccinations - ProPublica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9mTVVhZHdpUHpEUkJEZUI2bXFWZ2R2dkVfNXRfOFZISG1qQ1U1czFzRzhtLTE0d2ZCTjZISlpQdkxFdWQxU3FTQ0ppTkpiZ19ydUVOWDZLbFA0b0FLZGxYZGVKa1JkZ09ZN3FiOFc4VjdUTHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-pp-location="article body"&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
        
    &lt;/div&gt;

Forty-one patients have been hospitalized, and a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-vaccine-influencers-weaponized-measles-death-texas-rcna196900" target="_blank"&gt;6-year-old child has died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All but two of Texas' confirmed infections have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The outbreak has spread to three other states: New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, where the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization reported on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that a DNA sequence of the virus in one case was identical to those from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas, which has recorded 226 cases, according to the state health department. The county has one of the state’s highest school vaccine exemption rates at nearly 18%, according to&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" target="_blank"&gt; health department data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health for nearby Lubbock County, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News last week&lt;/a&gt; that efforts to increase vaccination there have gotten a lukewarm response and suggested that it could be a year until the outbreak is controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 92.7% of kindergarteners have had two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The two-shot regimen is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;97% effective at preventing measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-vaccination-rates-may-lower-thought-risking-us-elimination-sta-rcna198259" target="_blank"&gt;rate may be lower&lt;/a&gt; among children younger than 5, who are not fully captured in surveillance data. A &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/epdf/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307912" target="_blank"&gt;study last month&lt;/a&gt; calculated, based on a survey, that the share could be as low as 72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In large part thanks to the success of the MMR vaccine, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, meaning the virus is not continuously spreading, though there are occasional outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg" alt="One Death Reported As Texas Measles Outbreak Spreads"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Ambra Hawksley holds her son, Andrik, 6, while his sister, JaeLynn, holds his hand as he prepares to get an MMR vaccine at a clinic in Lubbock, Texas, on March 1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jan Sonnenmair / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Infants usually get their first measles shot at 12 to 15 months, followed by the second when they are 4 to 6 years old.

Carefully crafted from shaded green tea leaves, the tea is renowned for its rich flavor, smooth texture and culinary versatility, from overnight oats to cake and even jello shots. Along with its alluring sensory appeal, matcha green tea contains several key compounds that contribute to a wide range of health benefits. Below you will discover the health benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-matcha-powders-8702967" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;matcha powder&lt;/a&gt; and exciting ways to enjoy this robust—and often refreshing—beverage.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help You Feel More Relaxed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a mug of matcha may promote a sense of calm and clarity. Matcha contains an amino acid called &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/l-theanine-benefits-8662995" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, which has been found to boost alpha waves in the brain, leading to increased feelings of relaxation and calmness, says &lt;a href="https://upliftfitnutrition.com/about-lacey-dunn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacey Dunn, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine dietitian and owner of Uplift Fit Nutrition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; L-theanine also increases the production of several neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which help to reduce stress and anxiety, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Enhance Your Brain Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with being an excellent source of L-theanine, matcha also contains a small &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amount of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. Together, L-theanine and caffeine can increase memory and mental alertness, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In that way, you get the best of both worlds. “L-theanine may help to avoid the jittery and anxious feeling that comes with caffeine consumption, as well as promote a feeling of relaxation,” she says.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha may also aid in reducing oxidative stress, which can damage neurons in the brain and is linked to cognitive decline and memory impairment, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s believed that the EGCG and caffeine content in matcha may help to alleviate this and reduce neuroinflammation,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Reduce Your Risk of Cancer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making matcha a regular part of your daily routine may also aid in the prevention of certain cancers. “Matcha may help reduce cancer risk by halting the growth of cancer cells and reducing oxidative stress, which increases the risk of DNA damage and tumor formation,” says Dunn. The anti-cancer effects of matcha are attributed to a powerful catechin called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, matcha is just one part of your diet. More clinical research is needed to confirm these findings and understand its full potential in cancer prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Your Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The compounds in matcha may also tone up your ticker. More specifically, the catechins in matcha have strong antioxidant properties that help to lower inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease, says&lt;a href="https://jejenoval.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; JeJe Noval, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative and functional registered dietitian specializing in digestive and hormone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Matcha may also help to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and improve heart health through its ability to increase insulin sensitivity, reduce total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce triglycerides,” says Dunn. She adds that matcha may even have a small but beneficial effect on high blood pressure by boosting antioxidant enzymes that protect blood vessel walls from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Your Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly sipping on matcha tea may be good for your gut. The EGCG in matcha can help support gut health by counteracting harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For that reason, matcha may be a good addition to your diet in cases of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infections, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help Manage Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha may help lower blood glucose levels through its ability to improve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Think of insulin like a key, allowing glucose to enter your cells to be used, versus floating freely in the blood,” says Dunn. “When your cells are more sensitive to insulin, your body is better able to use glucose as fuel versus storing it as body fat,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The compound in matcha that is believed to regulate insulin secretion and enhance insulin sensitivity is a plant pigment called quercetin. This compound may support carbohydrate metabolism, says Noval, which may be one tool to help manage healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support a Healthy Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha’s rich EGCG and caffeine content may help slightly increase your metabolism and ability to burn fat through a process called thermogenesis, says Dunn. “This increased thermogenesis helps your body to produce more heat, which increases the calories you burn at rest,” Dunn explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This effect is likely to be small (and more research is needed), but matcha may play a role in your overall diet if you’re aiming to lose weight.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though matcha is typically safe to consume and well-tolerated by most people, its caffeine content may cause side effects in some individuals. “It may induce anxiety, irritability, insomnia or headaches in those sensitive to caffeine,” says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, high doses of matcha may affect liver enzyme function and detoxification pathways in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (This is most likely to occur from taking high doses of green tea supplements.) As a result, Dunn warns that this can interact with some medications. Therefore, if you have preexisting health conditions and are taking medications, speak with your health care provider to ensure matcha is safe for you to consume.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is matcha?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matcha is a green tea powder that is made from the leaves of the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis &lt;/em&gt;plant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What sets it apart from other green tea varieties is its unique cultivation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the growth period, the green tea bushes are covered with bamboo to shade the delicate leaves from direct sunlight. This method of sun protection prompts the tea leaves to produce higher amounts of beneficial compounds, including chlorophyll and L-theanine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These potent plant compounds give matcha its distinctive dark green pigment and robust flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the leaves have fully matured, they are carefully harvested and lightly steamed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The leaves are then ground into a fine powder to make matcha tea. Unlike steeping traditional &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-green-teas-8606079" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf, offering a more concentrated source of its many health-enhancing compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is OK and beneficial to drink matcha regularly. Matcha is a great beverage to consume in the morning, as it contains L-theanine and caffeine. The L-theanine, in particular, helps to offset the jittery feeling associated with caffeine consumption while promoting a sense of calm and mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to confirm matcha’s effects on weight loss, it may help increase your metabolism and ability to burn fat through a process called thermogenesis. However, matcha is not a magic bullet for weight loss and should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_5-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although matcha is safe to consume for most people, its caffeine content may cause several side effects, including headaches, anxiety, irritability and insomnia in those who are sensitive. Additionally, high doses of matcha may negatively influence liver enzyme function and the metabolism of certain medications. Therefore, it may be helpful to talk to your health care provider before making matcha a regular part of your dietary regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed in a cozy coffee shop or the comfort of your home, matcha contains several key compounds that make it ideal to add to your routine. From L-theanine to EGCG, matcha offers potential benefits for brain, gut and heart health and may aid in weight management and improve your blood glucose levels. If you have existing health concerns, be sure to consult with your health care provider before incorporating it into your daily routine.&lt;br&gt;

Longevity is one of three "transformational innovation opportunities" that will drive equity markets in the next decade, a team of strategists said in a note Wednesday. The other two are artificial intelligence and power and resources. "The combination of ever-increasing lifespans and a demographic shift toward an older population creates a range of investment opportunities," the UBS strategists wrote. One area that is already established in the space is retirement living, which is growing at a 4% compound annual growth rate until 2030, they said. The oldest baby boomers are rapidly approaching their 80th birthday and that is going to increase demand for senior housing options, such as independent living, assisted living and nursing homes. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp;amp; Care predicts that 200,000 additional senior housing units will be needed in 2025, an additional 500,000 units by 2028 and another 775,000 units by 2030. Senior housing stocks UBS sees two real estate investment trusts that will benefit from the trend, and they pay solid dividends. Ventas , whose portfolio includes senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities and medical office buildings, has a 2.8% dividend yield. Analyst Jonathan Woloshin likes the diversity in its real estate holdings and geographic locations. Ventas has 1,400 properties across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. VTR YTD mountain Ventas The ongoing recovery in senior housing, which took a hit during the Covid pandemic, has led to an uptick in Ventas' senior housing occupancy levels, he pointed out. New senior housing supply is now at its lowest level since the first quarter of 2013, he noted. "The increase in occupancy is leading to stronger pricing power and margin improvement," Woloshin said. In addition, the inconsistent management execution seen in recent quarters has abated and ventas' shares are closing the valuation gap with the company's largest peer, he added. Shares are up about 16% year to date. Welltower also has a diversified portfolio. The company boasts more than 1,500 senior housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. It pays a dividend yield of about 1.8%. "WELL has a strong senior housing portfolio located in a number of high-barrier-to-entry markets, something that continues to benefit the company in a post- COVID-19 world," UBS analyst Thomas Parmentier wrote. "In addition, senior housing occupancy gains have bolstered WELL's stock price." WELL YTD mountain Welltower The stock, which is up 21% so far this year, is trading at a "significant premium valuation" to its peers, he pointed out. However, he thinks a premium is justified given Welltower's strong operational performance and growth. "WELL is in solid financial shape, in our view, with an investment-grade balance sheet, a good management team, manageable debt maturities, and solid access to liquidity," Parmentier said. "We believe the dividend is safe and could increase should operating results continue to improve." Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

It staged the trial in conjunction with six NHS hospitals in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Shiva Tripathi, an NHS pain consultant and the chief investigator of the trial, said if the drug is approved by regulators and becomes available it would be “a gamechanger for chronic lower back pain on the similar levels as [how] antibiotics made a difference to infection. Because if we can get these 25% of the patients with chronic low back pain back to work, back to no medications, back to no more disability, then I think [that] will be the massive gamechanger for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the randomised controlled trial involved only 44 patients – 22 in Britain and 22 in Spain, Denmark and New Zealand – so PP353 will have to undergo further trials, and be endorsed by the medicines watchdogs, before doctors can offer it to patients to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The patients had all had severe back pain for at least six months, and in some cases more than five years, that had not responded to conventional treatment, such as painkilling medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Persica said that a big advantage of their treatment is that the patient has two injections four days apart rather than undergoing surgery or taking tablets for a long time. Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/18/only-10-of-non-surgical-treatments-for-back-problems-kill-pain-says-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt; that most of the 56 ways of trying to alleviate back pain which researchers studied – ranging from massage and acupuncture to painkillers and physiotherapy – brought little or no real relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;PP353 is a combination of three substances that are already widely used in medicine: linezolid, an antibiotic; iohexol, a contrast agent or dye; and a thermosensitive gel. It is injected into the lower back in order to banish an infection that has developed around the discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Steve Ruston, the firm’s chief executive, said: “Our first patient trial produced really positive results. [It produced] significant reductions in pain and disability and [patients also got] clinically meaningful benefit and statistically significant benefit. The patient benefit potential is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you can reduce the pain and disability that people are living with in the way that some of our [trial] patients have responded, it will transform their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Market research shows that 2 million people in the US and 250,000-300,000 in the UK could benefit, he added. “Millions of people around the world can benefit from this. But low back pain is not just a first-world problem; everybody gets low back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The drug is different from other back pain treatments, Ruston added, because it targets the underlying cause of the problem rather than just its main symptom – pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/low-back-pain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Low back pain&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world’s commonest health problems. Six in 10 people in the UK develop it at some point. It is expected to grow as a problem worldwide because of the ageing and growing population. It is often hard to diagnose the cause and even harder to treat successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many patients in the trial experienced a drop in the amount of pain they were suffering within a month of the injections and were still feeling a lot better after a year, Persica said. However, it reduced, but did not remove, the need to keep taking painkillers, Ruston added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But Dr Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist at Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London, who specialises in chronic pain, voiced scepticism about PP353’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Modern medicine has largely failed people with chronic – in other words, long-term – back pain. But there is little evidence that interventions using surgery or injections, or even taking medicines, makes much difference for the vast majority of people with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“People with chronic low back pain are understandably desperate for anything that can help. There’s also a huge industry in supplying technologies and medicines that claim to help, but little evidence that these do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Promising holistic approaches, such as cognitive functional therapy, often don’t get a look in, particularly when services are overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That being said, if there is a subgroup of people with chronic low back pain that can reliably and safely benefit from a simple pair of injections, then that would be fantastic news – but it seems unlikely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQTzlldDZ2MHBrU2h1V0dUMUFxV2hBV2t5MXhlQkF3dGF2cllyOWVqUTNxYW11dWdodktZcGxUTnFmQTliUmZabmh2a0NGYmpvN0pkWngtOFFsZnBTZDNBYjU1eHJpekFBWEJRTmlaYU9kSXNHWFJIRjFKak1QV0piQ2x2cGk2R3k2Z1QxN19jSFVTV29pc0ZBWHlSeU9PeGI4</guid></item><item><title>It’s Considered an Old-Timey Disease.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2f91a004tvrm01n4s93zr@published"&gt;Tuberculosis has been crawling its way back into the spotlight. In 2020, after a &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/us-tuberculosis-tb-rates-rising"&gt;three-decade decline&lt;/a&gt;, TB cases in the U.S. began climbing again. Last year, that number &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/tuberculosis-tb-infection-cdc-d1165566b838bd8a838975e4e5e13b79"&gt;was at its highest since 2011&lt;/a&gt;. There has been a &lt;a href="https://www.kumc.edu/about/news/news-archive/tuberculosis-outbreak-in-kansas.html"&gt;TB outbreak in Kansas&lt;/a&gt; since January 2024, with over 100 people infected and two deaths. Recent data show that Europe saw a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-calls-immediate-action-report-shows-10-rise-child-tb-infections-european-2025-03-24/"&gt;10 percent rise in childhood infections&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, with more than 7,500 cases. What with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World Tuberculosis Day&lt;/a&gt; this week, and the release of John Green’s new book &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/john-green-tuberculosis-book-fault-in-our-stars.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week, TB, which is often thought of as an old-timey disease, might seem to suddenly be a concern once again.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001w3b72hcriri8h@published"&gt;In reality, though, tuberculosis never went away. It regularly kills over a million people a year and infects millions more. It is literally the world’s &lt;em&gt;deadliest infectious disease&lt;/em&gt;—yes, you read that right. It was bumped out of first place by COVID-19 for a while, but it returned to the top last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001x3b72k4wp4hod@published"&gt;We don’t hear much about TB in the U.S. because it’s largely under control here, but it’s a huge threat in other regions, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2023/tb-disease-burden/1-1-tb-incidence"&gt;Southeast Asia and Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There are treatments for TB. And yet, the federal government’s &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160826"&gt;recent cuts to foreign aid&lt;/a&gt; mean that many people across the world will no longer be able to access treatment (on top of all the people who already lacked access to treatment). “We can cure virtually everyone with tuberculosis,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “We have the capacity to do that.” As Slate’s Tony Ho Tran wrote eloquently in a piece about &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/john-green-tuberculosis-book-fault-in-our-stars.html"&gt;Green’s new book&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s a decision to let people die.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001y3b72sv68pd1m@published"&gt;That decision also increases the risk for Americans, most of whom have long been lucky enough to not have to think about TB. Let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001z3b72y1ihguzc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;cases rising in the U.S. right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw00203b72k5yu573n@published"&gt;Any time there’s turbulence in the world, the risk of transmission increases. That’s true of most diseases, but especially for TB, which requires long courses of treatment to work. Whether due to armed conflicts, refugee migration, or a global pandemic, “if populations are in turmoil, public health breaks down,” says Schaffner. “And tuberculosis control programs come to a screeching halt.” That’s what happened in 2020, when COVID brought the world, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10381217/"&gt;TB control programs&lt;/a&gt;, to a stop. When those initiatives stall, infected individuals can’t receive their treatment, and they can’t be monitored and supported while receiving their treatment. That leads to more transmission, which means more infections—which increases risk even in places where the disease has been under control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw00213b72ca63f3bh@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m realizing I don’t even know what tuberculosis &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00223b72i0m775m6@published"&gt;Fair enough! It shows up in movies and books as old-fashioned and romantic—think poets wasting away by the seaside of “consumption” (TB’s historical nickname). The wasting-away part is true: “For the most part, TB is a &lt;em&gt;smoldering&lt;/em&gt; disease,” says Schaffner. It kills slowly. But it’s definitely not romantic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00233b72rfn46kgj@published"&gt;Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that, after infecting a person, tend to hibernate in the body. It can stay there for five, 10, 20 years, without causing any symptoms. This is known as latent infection, and it’s not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00243b72gpqm325q@published"&gt;Eventually, though, the bacteria wake up, and that’s when active infection starts. At that point, the person with the infection is now contagious. The bacteria start eating away at the lungs, destroying tissue. From there, it can move to other parts of the body. Symptoms—prolonged cough, chest pain, weakness, fever—may start off mild. Depending on the person’s age and health, they can suffer from active infection for more than a year, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/tuberculosis-death-usaid-trump/682062/"&gt;losing weight&lt;/a&gt; due to lack of appetite and extreme abdominal pain, until their lungs collapse or fill with fluid—or a few other terrible possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="6" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00253b72ej1rwvi1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there are treatments available, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00263b72teahaxe3@published"&gt;Yes. “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/health/tuberculosis-tb-treatment-vaccine-diagnosis.html?unlocked_article_code=1.7E4.N_z-.-t1g_6WlN_mQ&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare"&gt;TB is curable and preventable&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;World Health Organization’s website&lt;/a&gt;. However, treatment isn’t a straightforward one-and-done kind of thing. It involves six months of a multidrug regimen; using just one drug can lead to the bacteria’s becoming resistant such that they simply do not respond to that drug. In some cases, if treatment is implemented incorrectly, a person’s bacteria can become resistant to multiple drugs, which then makes it very difficult to treat. Multidrug-resistant TB is considered a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tackling-the-drug-resistant-tb-crisis"&gt;pretty serious public health issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00273b729ym04k8z@published"&gt;Crucially, you don’t want something happening in the middle of TB treatment that disrupts a patient’s access to drugs. The Trump administration’s funding cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which among many other things supports TB treatment programs, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives"&gt;are just that kind of disruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00283b72lyx3f5w4@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yikes. What about preventing TB in the first place? Is there a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00293b72c3a5g2e3@published"&gt;There is one, but it’s not very effective for adults or adolescents. For babies and small children in countries where TB is common, it can help protect against death and more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002a3b72yx7ikgoo@published"&gt;Finding a new, better TB vaccine is one of the holy grails of vaccinology, says Schaffner, along with better flu and COVID vaccines and an HIV vaccine: “These are at the top of the list of every vaccinologist’s Christmas list.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002b3b727vbstzhm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we treat &lt;em&gt;latent &lt;/em&gt;TB, then? Get ahead of things, instead of waiting for the infection to become active?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002c3b72dnh2w94j@published"&gt;We can! And that’s the ideal situation: Find everyone with latent TB and treat them before&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they become contagious and experience symptoms. “That’s actually part of the plan of every state’s TB program,” says Schaffner. “And we need to do more of that.” You can test for TB with an easy skin test; there’s also a newer blood-test option. The good news is that if you do have latent TB, you don’t have to wait until it becomes active to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm"&gt;receive treatment&lt;/a&gt; (which is still a regimen of multiple drugs over several months).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="14" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabz002d3b72r3vvm0gj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, I’m ready to get tested! Point me to the nearest TB testing stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabz002e3b72jj3nqghu@published"&gt;If you’re near the &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;outbreak in Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, you may be contacted by public health authorities to get tested. In those cases, “please cooperate with the public health authorities, because it’s to your own benefit,” says Schaffner. But in general, we don’t do mass TB testing in the U.S. because there’s no real need. Despite being deadly, TB is not contagious in the way that measles or COVID is—TB typically &lt;a href="https://ehs.unc.edu/topics/infectious-diseases/tuberculosis/"&gt;requires &lt;em&gt;prolonged &lt;/em&gt;exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Certain populations are at higher risk of TB, Schaffner says, including people in low-income areas, people who have been in prison, people with HIV infection, or people raised in countries where TB is more common. Screening is more important in those communities. Other populations, like health care workers, are regularly tested for TB.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002g3b72s9eh6itz@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But with TB rates rising in parts of the world …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002h3b720au1fykt@published"&gt;Right. People in the U.S. are extremely fortunate to not have to think about tuberculosis on the regular. As the richest country in the world, we have a responsibility to help those who are less advantaged. So we should care about the rising cases for humanitarian reasons. But TB in other parts of the world &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/health/usaid-funding-disease-outbreaks.html"&gt;does also concern&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. directly. “Germs don’t need a passport,” says Schaffner. “Whatever’s over there can be over here in 24 hours.” This is true of any infectious disease, and something we saw very clearly with COVID-19. Again, TB is not at all like COVID—and the primary reason to worry about TB is because of the destruction it causes globally, not because of the risk it poses to you personally. But the more TB spreads, the higher your chances of being near an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002i3b72rgsqy3dp@published"&gt;Undoubtedly, the cuts to USAID funding—which, in addition to funding prevention, testing, and treatment services, has been the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives"&gt;third-largest TB research funder&lt;/a&gt;—will lead to more illness and death. It might not be immediately apparent in the data, says Schaffner, because TB is a relatively slow-moving disease. But many lives &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/health/tuberculosis-kenya-us-cuts.html"&gt;are already being affected&lt;/a&gt;. As WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/tuberculosis-returns-top-infectious-disease-killer-who-says-2024-10-29/"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;: “The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and perhaps pass away when they were one or two years old," according to Dr Jamie Duckers, consultant at the All Wales Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But the latest data... suggests if you're born now with cystic fibrosis in the UK, half are expected to live to at least 64 years old - and some new data suggests many patients can expect to live much closer to normal life expectancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Advances have also been made possible through screenings, such as the heel-prick test for babies, but also as Dr Duckers said, through the rollout of ground-breaking new therapies - made possible by clinical trials such as the one Sophie took part in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a real exemplar of what can be done through research," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:57:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1mRUdidzlpNVZDLW51QXBQWHVWdWJjQzAwN215TFhaOGFsNHdpNzNmUFZMR0NMMDFWZUdBbldKUDlVS0hhb3ljSTNtNnRNY2o1YU5fdkZNOFZyUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9feGZVWk9ZM1hQb0s2eE1TRmhzaWotQ2U2WUFNY191ZG9zUkpyVTBzVnFUd0lyazdUajM1LWtkSUJieThIVmN3TXBxcTRoQ2VmRm0zdUdoSTdySF96c0pn</guid></item><item><title>My Daughter Has a Rare Condition That Requires a Specialist.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4kf00233572gv9tpkgm@published"&gt;My 14-year-old, “Kim,” was recently diagnosed with a condition that is not life-threatening but that does need to be managed by a specialist. There are not many specialists, as the condition is relatively rare. She must see this specialist every 4-to-6 weeks for at least a year or two. Our family gets our health insurance from my husband’s employer; if the doctor is in-network, the copays are very affordable. A handful of in-network specialists are within a two-hour drive of our house, and they are all male doctors. The problem is, Kim refuses to see a male doctor, as her condition may require occasional physical examinations on a private area. I totally get Kim’s feelings; I prefer female doctors if they will see me naked, but I will see a male doctor in an emergency or if there are no other options.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4pd00243572j1572s0l@published"&gt;There are one or two female doctors out-of-network that are driving distance, but paying out-of-pocket for monthly visits (not to mention testing if these doctors use only out-of-network labs) will be cost-prohibitive without cutting the budget elsewhere. I am unsure what to do and feel there is no good answer. It does feel wrong to make Kim see a doctor she feels uncomfortable with. On the other hand, I do not want to lessen our contributions to retirement accounts, college funds, and other savings. My daughters (I have two other teens) do one non-school-sponsored extracurricular (music lessons, dance classes, etc.). I do not want this to impact my other girls, and it feels unfair to ask Kim to choose between flute lessons or a female doctor. Forgoing medical care is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4s9002635721t61i3q3@published"&gt;I have considered the remote possibility that Kim feels uncomfortable because of a nonconsensual sexual experience, but she maintains that nothing like that has happened to her. I have told her that these male doctors will allow her to have a female nurse or patient advocate in the room with her during the exams and that I (her mom) could go in the examination room with her if she wants me to. But Kim still protests when I bring up seeing the male doctor. What do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4zx002a35725ahtri01@published"&gt;You’re right, there’s really no good answer here. Either Kim will have to get past her discomfort with male doctors, or there will have to be significant financial sacrifices made to accommodate her. I think you should let your daughter know that there are likely to be times in her life when a female doctor may not be an option, such as on a trip to the emergency room; it’s also possible that if she continues to have to manage this rare condition, there may not be female specialists available in the future—it would be best to help her get past this aversion now.&lt;/p&gt;

Reiterate your promise to be in the exam room with her, and alert the practice about your daughter’s anxiety, so that the doctors and staff may be extra sensitive. Gently explain to her that she simply cannot forgo this care and that she has no choice but to allow a man to treat her.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since last year, when her friend had to drop out because she got long-COVID, my daughter has become obsessed with it. First, she was just obsessively reading articles on health and wellness, but now she’s sending me studies from medical journals about how getting COVID affects all these organs and aspects of the body. Worse yet, now she’s bought this high-end respirator that looks like some kind of space alien mask and refuses to be around people if she’s not wearing it. She’s even talking about changing her major to epidemiology and abandoning her dream of being a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e59e002e3572ilfe5er6@published"&gt;I’m worried that she’s alienating herself from her peers and making herself a target for social ostracism. We were reasonably cautious during the pandemic when she was in high school, but I don’t bother masking anymore since we’ve had the virus a few times and it didn’t seem so bad. Now, however, my daughter has me reconsidering the choice to stop masking since she’s constantly telling me about some horrible outcome that someone she read about had from it. I don’t want her to be right about this, especially since this choice is almost certainly hurting her socially, but the more I’ve researched it myself, the more I think she may have a point. How can I help her balance these fears without letting her get totally alienated from her peers for being the weird girl in the mask?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us stopped taking COVID seriously a couple of years ago, but it is still very much out here; furthermore, long-COVID sufferers are experiencing devastating symptoms, and we still don’t know all the long-term effects of even a short course of the virus. It seems unreasonable to me to be concerned about the social impact on your daughter when it sounds like she’s taking wise steps to protect herself from what could be a devastating illness, particularly when you consider what happened to her classmate.&lt;br&gt;Ask yourself, does she have meaningful friendships? Has her social life suffered since she started taking COVID more seriously, or are you just assuming that the respirator turns people off?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2ko4c00363572vj3pwh6i@published"&gt;As a compromise, you could encourage her to continue masking up but ask her to consider a less obtrusive N95 mask for situations in which she needs to interact with people, such as at school or at family functions. But honestly, it sounds like she knows what she’s doing here better than a lot of us do. If your daughter’s concern about this starts to turn into a true fixation or obsession, in the sense that it is damaging the rest of her life, get her to a therapist to parse out sensible protection from problematic anxiety. But for now, I’d say let her take care of her own health as she chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

He says everything about her is better and he’s never been happier. I broke up with him, hoping he would realize his abusive ways need to change. Instead, he got this girlfriend and now messages me multiple times a day about how he hates me (with awful insults) and loves her. I’m so heartbroken! He claims to have gotten a job, but all the years I was with him, he never worked once. He says he’s gonna marry her, but would tell me I don’t deserve it. I don’t understand why he can do all these things for someone new who won’t even give him a place to stay, but not me? What’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

He’ll only see him if I’m not there, but if I say fine, he gets mad at me and accuses me of wanting to go be with other men during that time. I’m at my wit’s end. Should I wait and hope this passes and that he will come to his senses? Do I write him a letter about how sad I am? Should I contact his mother or aunt? I used to tell his dad about how his son was behaving, and he would set him straight, but he died recently. I just want this whole ordeal to end.&lt;/p&gt;

He abused you during the relationship and continues to abuse you via text message. There is nothing wrong with you that is preventing your ex from treating you the way you deserve to be treated. He is not a good guy, and you know that. Instead of agonizing over what he may or may not be doing for his alleged new woman (whom he may be fabricating just to get under your skin), you need to be focused on taking care of yourself and your child. Why would you want a man who mistreats you, doesn’t work, and uses his relationship to you to determine if he sees his son or not?&lt;/p&gt;

I am assuming that this guy doesn’t voluntarily give you money for your child. If you could use some additional support, consider going through the process of having him forced to pay child support through the court system. As far as facilitating visits goes, see if you can coordinate through his mother or aunt so you don’t have to deal with him harassing you about what you’re doing during that time. Let this man know that you are interested in allowing him to have a relationship with his son, but that you will only be willing to do that if he can both treat you with respect and be consistent. If he is unwilling to accept these terms, then do away with visitation.&lt;/p&gt;

Has your son been a witness to how his father talks to you? If not, would you want him to see that? If so, have you considered the impact that may have on his relationships with women in the future? Would you want your son to grow up to be like his father? You have to (quickly) dry your eyes and move past your interest in this guy. The only thing he can do for you is step-up and be an active father to your child. If he refuses to do that, then you need to eliminate him from your life altogether. But the longer you hold on to the fantasy of having him as a partner, the longer he’ll be able to hurt you, and that will certainly impact your child in ways you do not want.&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8hgd000v26p2d046fslg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On March 10, Dr. Nisha Acharya got a letter from the National Institutes of Health terminating her grant to study the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine recommended for all adults 50 and older in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400022e6b7o1s5hy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The grant was canceled after a change in NIH policy to not “prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” according to the termination letter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400032e6baq6nlbmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The policy shift was no surprise: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, now leads the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400042e6bbpuppzvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What was surprising about her grant cancellation is that she’s not studying vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400052e6b38c6vl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rather, in a written description of her research, Acharya said, “I had the words ‘hesitancy’ and ‘vaccine’ in the same sentence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400062e6bu2xdo68n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She thinks her funding was caught in a dragnet of NIH grant cancellations driven by haphazard, error-prone word searches rather than careful review of the research in question. HHS has not clarified how it is selecting grants for termination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400072e6bqjuoqrpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few weeks, the NIH has canceled at least two dozen grants to researchers who were looking at ways to increase vaccination rates or fight vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400082e6bz48qah1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The changes come as scientists and universities are already reeling from cuts to funding for research about &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/nih-climate-change-funding-propublica/index.html"&gt;climate science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut/index.html"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and many other topics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400092e6b2qgxdyat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Acharya, the cancellation wipes out just over three years of funding on her current grant that she says is worth almost $2 million in direct and indirect costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc4000a2e6bfqqz8e2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, she plans to lay off three full-time employees who were working with her to analyze large amounts of data related to the vaccine. Acharya, a clinician scientist at the University of California at San Francisco, will keep her job seeing patients, although the grant paid about 35% of her salary, which she used for time to conduct research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000b2e6b7y31dpyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t have a way of continuing this work,” said Acharya, who is planning to appeal the decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000c2e6b6zj0kf30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy, a lawyer, testified that he was “pro-safety” and “pro-good science.” He denied being anti-vaccine and has said he wants people to know the risks and benefits of the vaccinations before they get them, a principle called informed consent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000d2e6b0nz7wey1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s what Acharya wants, too. She believes that studies on vaccine hesitancy are valid and worthwhile and should continue to be funded — but it’s not what she’s studying.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000e2e6blya06h2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not anti-vax. I am pro-science, whether it’s positives or negatives,” she said. “I understand that with any medicine, any vaccine, there may be things that are very good and things that people may need to be cautious about. That is the goal, right?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000g2e6b6c7xkf79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya is an ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, who studies inflammatory diseases of the eye. Until March 10, she was studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine, particularly as it relates to an infection called herpes zoster ophthalmicus: shingles in the nerves around the eye. This complication is painful and can lead to blindness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000h2e6ba64nln49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 1 in 3 adults will have shingles at some point in their lives, and Acharya said that 10% to 20% of those cases will involve shingles of the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000i2e6bemutwkr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The clinical trials that test vaccines can tell researchers whether a shot will generally be effective at preventing the more severe complications of an infection. Clinical trials can also catch common safety issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000j2e6bqt1ceztv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But rare side effects and adverse events from vaccines often aren’t picked up until they’re launched across the population and used by hundreds of thousands of people of different ages and sexes and with different underlying conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000k2e6bmtv0zu06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya was studying all those questions related to the Shingrix vaccine, which landed on the US market in 2018. It is recommended for all adults 50 and older to prevent painful bouts of shingles, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000l2e6bovuprocr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya said she saw an opportunity to gather more data. “Those trials that led to FDA approval did not include people who had had shingles already. They don’t really include people who are sick or had a lot of medical problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000m2e6bm25zahx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to really understand how well the vaccine is working for different age groups, for different people, maybe people who have different comorbidities or different conditions, like who are immunocompromised, people who already have had shingles, already have had shingles on the eye. There’s all these questions that we have no data for, no information,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000o2e6bvrbgvysk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She applied for and won a grant through the NIH to study these questions. It’s a highly competitive process that requires months of work to prepare and submit, and goes through rounds of review from peers before it’s awarded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000p2e6bslbb4tyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After her first five-year grant, Acharya was able to show that her work had produced important findings: for example, that the vaccine was safe and effective at preventing shingles – including around the eye – in people who had not had it before. So the NIH awarded her another round of five-year funding to continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000q2e6b951m3r2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she wanted her second round of research to dig into a question that made her fellow ophthalmologists hesitant to recommend the vaccine to their patients: Many of them had seen people who got the vaccine experience a dangerous reawakening of the virus in their eyes. Was it a coincidence or a real risk?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000r2e6ba70vd6g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m in a very specialized field, and we actually have a little bit of concern in this very specialized subgroup of people who already have shingles in the eye,” Acharya said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000s2e6bvm3ux9ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya wanted to see whether it was true that the vaccine could trigger another bout of shingles inflammation. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2814944?resultClick=1" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, she showed that it could — an important safety consideration. GSK did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sxw9zu00003b6moim18g87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Acharya urged more monitoring of patients. She imagined that this data might eventually be used to refine recommendations about who should get the vaccine. But it was just the first study; more research is needed for such a change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000t2e6bo048trak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, her grant was cancelled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rwq6e000013b6m9x1dmuol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t answer specific questions about how it was deciding to terminate grants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000v2e6b2katgn8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities. At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science. As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” an HHS official said in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000w2e6bdwbs0v6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya calls it “ironic” that her grant was flagged. “I never got to explain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000x2e6bg699um14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She says the program officers overseeing her grant at the NIH knew her work well, and “they didn’t have any part in this decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000z2e6b0qleb9n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter gives her 30 days to appeal the termination if she believes that it was made in error, and the appeal goes directly to Dr. Matthew Memoli, who has been acting director of the agency while new NIH Director &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-hearing-nih/index.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Bhattacharya&lt;/a&gt; was awaiting confirmation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What really makes Acharya sad is the effect of the funding cuts on her colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500122e6bju799pyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t save them,” she said. “I’m trying to call people and try to get jobs for them. I’m trying to set up interviews and stuff, but it’s really hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500142e6brqqrl23s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Universities have lost so much federal research funding that many are coping with their own grant cancellations and doing their own belt-tightening. There’s a &lt;a href="https://chancellor.ucsf.edu/news/uc-hiring-freeze-and-financial-outlook" target="_blank"&gt;hiring freeze&lt;/a&gt; at UCSF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not these people’s fault that they ended up being in a research group that was good, it was so promising, and their careers would have been made, and now it’s gone, and they’re gonna be out of a job,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Adenosine is a molecule that helps regulate bodily functions like sleep, blood pressure, and heart rate—and when caffeine blocks these receptors, the body responds by making you feel more awake, focused, and energized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The downside? This impact can also lead to physical sensations like increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and muscle tension—all symptoms that may mimic anxiety.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-coffee-can-cause-anxiousness" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why Coffee Can Cause Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Can coffee cause anxiety even in non-anxious people? The short answer: usually no, but there are exceptions. “In the general population, you don’t see people who generate anxiety disorders if they drink about one to three cups of coffee per day,” says &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Astrid Nehlig" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Astrid Nehlig&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a neuroscientist and research director at &lt;a href="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="INSERM" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;INSERM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Strasbourg, France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, if you feel like you are the chillest person in the room yet feel on edge after drinking coffee, there are a few instances related to genetics variation, metabolization, and the amount/frequency of coffee intake—in which experts say coffee &lt;em data-node-id="16.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; certainly trigger anxiety—even in non-anxious people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Gene Variation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Nehlig, who is also the editor-in-chief of &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Epilepsy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em data-node-id="18.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  explains that a particular &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genetic variation" data-node-id="18.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; exists that can mess with how your body regulates dopamine and wakefulness, making you more sensitive to caffeine. However, the variation is “quite rare, affecting only about 5 percent of the population, ” she notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;On top of that, having this gene variation also makes you a "slow caffeine metabolizer," Nehlig says—which means your body takes longer to break down caffeine. You would likely only know that you have this genetic variation if you have done genetic testing via your doctor or an at-home genetic testing health kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="metabolization" data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;Metabolization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The metabolization factor, or how fast the body breaks down the caffeine in your coffee, affects your sensitivity to coffee. Usually, the half-life of caffeine is between three and five hours. However, “The population is evenly distributed between fast and slow metabolizers of coffee, and how long the half-life of coffee remains in their system can be a determinant of how sensitive people are to caffeine,” says Nehlig. This is why some people can drink multiple cups of coffee in a short time without issues, while others start feeling jittery or anxious after just one cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Fast caffeine metabolizers break down caffeine quickly, so they can have two to three cups over six hours without much buildup in their system. On the other hand, slow caffeine metabolizers process caffeine more slowly, so it stays in their system longer. As they continue drinking coffee, the caffeine accumulates, making them more likely to experience side effects like anxiety and jitteriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="caffeine-consumption-level-and-frequency" data-node-id="23" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Caffeine Consumption Level And Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The last and most common instance in which coffee can cause non-anxious people anxiety is the amount of caffeine consumption. As a general rule, “If you drink too much coffee or too much caffeine in other forms, then it’s contraindicated for you and you will start raising anxiety,” says Nehlig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Coffee naturally has a larger concentration of caffeine than some other caffeinated drinks. The exact amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee depends on the coffee variety, region it comes from, brewing method, and serving size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The recommended amount? The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;FDA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites 400 milligrams per day—which is about four or five cups of coffee—as a safe amount for adults. “In most people, it's just finding the right level under which they have no anxiety,” says Nehlig, who adds that no more than 200 mg per sitting and no more than 400 mg a day of caffeine should be exceeded regardless of the source of caffeine including teas, matcha, sodas, and energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="27" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;How much caffeine is in these common drinks (12 oz.), according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="27.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="28" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0.0"&gt;Decaf coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 to 15 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;Green tea: &lt;/strong&gt;30 to 50 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;Soft drinks&lt;/strong&gt;: 23 to 83 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;Matcha&lt;/strong&gt;: 35 to 130 mg &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.4.0"&gt;Black tea&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 to 48 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.5.0"&gt;Energy drinks:&lt;/strong&gt; 80 to 200 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.6"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.6.0"&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;: 113 to 247 mg (depending on brewing method)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ever wondered why drinking coffee affects you differently than drinking matcha or green tea? The bottom line is that coffee in and of itself is probably not causing your anxiety.

But in practice, both Nehlig and Dr. Sultan say there isn’t enough research to recommend adding L-theanine supplements to coffee for this purpose—mainly because there’s currently no research that proves a benefit, or explores the implications of combining these chemical compounds. “It's true that tea is making you less nervous, but there is twice or even three times less caffeine, which might already be an explanation,” says Nehlig. So, the L-theanine may not have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Instead, Dr. Sultan recommends drinking L-theanine from sources that naturally contain it already like tea and matcha rather than adding an L-theanine supplement to coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-enjoy-your-coffee-sans-anxiousness" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;How To Enjoy Your Coffee Sans Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Our experts reiterate that caffeine itself doesn’t usually cause anxiety but can make it worse if you’re already prone to it. However, if you do think your caffeine intake is bringing out anxiousness for you, consider cutting back or kicking the habit entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If coffee makes you feel jittery, try channeling that energy into movement, like a quick walk. If you’re especially sensitive, Nehlig recommends switching from Robusta (which has twice the caffeine of Arabica) to a lower-caffeine Arabica variety like Bourbon Pointu.

Vitamin A at very high doses — high doses that you would never administer by yourself at home — but high-dose vitamin A administered in the hospital has shown to reduce both mortality and duration and severity of [measles] illness,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of truth in the statement he made is that giving vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil as like a panacea for all the people in Texas ... is unequivocally wrong,” Patel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil as a measles treatment has not been studied, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joel Bervell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Joel Bervell&lt;/a&gt;, a recent medical graduate and medical myth-buster on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same as vitamin A supplementation,” Bervell explained. “I think the reason why he was talking about cod oil in the first place was it has high levels of vitamin A, but the amount of vitamin A that’s in cod oil can vary widely, and relying on that instead of vaccines can be risky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementation for children just generally can also be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a blanket statement, I would never give my kids cod liver oil because we know the supplement industry is not very well regulated,” Patel explained. “I don’t like giving my kids any supplements, because the truth is, you have no idea what’s in them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, taking too much of any vitamin, including vitamin A, can lead to complications and toxicity, Bervell said. “It can cause ... liver damage to fatigue to hair loss and headaches.” According to Texas Public Radio, the hospitalized children who are now being treated for vitamin A toxicity have abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A also can interact with other medications, which can lead to more problems, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vitamin A isn’t going to prevent someone from getting the measles, and it’s also not proven to help with symptoms for patients who aren’t hospitalized, according to Patel. Ingesting high amounts of vitamin A or cod liver oil can lead to real health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope RFK knows that what he says is what parents are going to do,” Bervell said. “If they’re believing that either vitamin A or cod oil is a replacement for vaccines, that’s going to do their children, and the rest of communities in these areas, more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting the measles vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is what actually works when it comes to protecting yourself from the measles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and your loved ones from measles, your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine if you haven’t already, Patel stressed. The typical guidance is for children to get the first dose of the two-dose shot at 12 months, but children as young as 6 months can get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in any pocket of the country that has had a measles case, I would 100% get my child vaccinated early if they were over 6 months,” Patel said, adding that she also encourages people to get their kids the shots early if they are traveling internationally somewhere with measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second dose of the measles vaccine is typically given to children between 4 and 6 years old, you can also get their second dose early as long as it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at least 28 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;at least 28 days&lt;/a&gt; since their first dose, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first dose, you’re 93% protected against the measles. After the second dose, you’re 97% protected,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults who don’t know their vaccination status or older adults who could have waning measles protection, Patel recommended that you get your titers drawn. This is done via a blood test that measures antibody levels in your blood. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this option to get set up with a test. If your measles antibody levels are low, you can get another MMR shot for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical experts think there needs to be a larger focus on vaccination by the current administration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous years when we see measles outbreaks, health officials have said we need to have an increase in public health information out there about why people need vaccinations,” Bervell said. “I haven’t seen that to the same degree with this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. continues to call vaccination a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="personal decision" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be making sure that we understand the importance of vaccines right now,” Bervell said, and added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration need to be more focused on putting accurate information out about why the measles vaccine, specifically, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Ingesting high amounts of vitamin A or cod liver oil can lead to real health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope RFK knows that what he says is what parents are going to do,” Bervell said. “If they’re believing that either vitamin A or cod oil is a replacement for vaccines, that’s going to do their children, and the rest of communities in these areas, more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting the measles vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is what actually works when it comes to protecting yourself from the measles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and your loved ones from measles, your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine if you haven’t already, Patel stressed. The typical guidance is for children to get the first dose of the two-dose shot at 12 months, but children as young as 6 months can get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in any pocket of the country that has had a measles case, I would 100% get my child vaccinated early if they were over 6 months,” Patel said, adding that she also encourages people to get their kids the shots early if they are traveling internationally somewhere with measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second dose of the measles vaccine is typically given to children between 4 and 6 years old, you can also get their second dose early as long as it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at least 28 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;at least 28 days&lt;/a&gt; since their first dose, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first dose, you’re 93% protected against the measles. After the second dose, you’re 97% protected,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults who don’t know their vaccination status or older adults who could have waning measles protection, Patel recommended that you get your titers drawn. This is done via a blood test that measures antibody levels in your blood. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this option to get set up with a test. If your measles antibody levels are low, you can get another MMR shot for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical experts think there needs to be a larger focus on vaccination by the current administration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous years when we see measles outbreaks, health officials have said we need to have an increase in public health information out there about why people need vaccinations,” Bervell said. “I haven’t seen that to the same degree with this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. continues to call vaccination a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="personal decision" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be making sure that we understand the importance of vaccines right now,” Bervell said, and added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration need to be more focused on putting accurate information out about why the measles vaccine, specifically, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

                                &lt;p&gt;Sixteen people in Yakima County have active cases of tuberculosis, according to Yakima Health District officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven cases are being monitored by the Yakima Health District and nine are being monitored by Indian Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies are working to identify and test anyone that may have been exposed to the disease, Stephanie Ruiz, Yakima Health District spokesperson said in an email. The first case in the county was confirmed in September, but not all active cases are linked to the same outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are in the Lower Valley, but specific cities and locations are not released to protect patient privacy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severity of cases can vary, Melissa Sixberry, director of disease control for the Yakima Health District said at a Board of Health meeting on Wednesday. Some people may experience a mild cough, but others may take a long time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a large number compared to what we normally would be managing," Sixberry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis patients must have their treatment observed daily, which can cause a strain on health resources, Sixberry said. The county has been using video visits, but Indian Health Services must go to the patient to do it in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Treatment can go anywhere from four months to 12 months," Sixberry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people can receive their treatment at home, Ruiz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis, or TB, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory disease caused by a bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and spread through the air when an infected person coughs or speaks, according to the CDC. Without treatment, it can be fatal. Some people can have the disease without symptoms, called inactive TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of exposure is low unless you have prolonged exposure to an infected person, Ruiz said. Anyone with concerns should speak with their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In other news&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakima County has had 12 flu deaths since the season began in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Activity is still high," Sixberry said in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no pediatric deaths in the county, but there have been elsewhere in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with additional information from the health district.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

D. Abrol, orthopaedics and joint replacement surgeon, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals said, “Many people believe calcium alone is enough to keep bones strong, but that’s only part of the story. Without &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/vitamin-d" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, the body struggles to absorb calcium, making even a calcium-rich diet ineffective.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Importance of calcium for bone health:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Calcium is the foundation of strong bones, helping to keep them dense and resistant to fractures. Since the body cannot produce calcium on its own, it must come from food. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are excellent sources. For those who avoid dairy, green leafy vegetables, almonds, and fortified foods like plant-based milk and cereals provide good alternatives. When the body doesn’t get enough calcium, it starts pulling it from the bones, weakening them over time,” Dr S. D. Abrol explained. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/world-osteoporosis-day-2024-everyday-habits-that-can-weaken-your-bone-health-expert-tips-for-stronger-bones-101729341825438.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Osteoporosis Day 2024: Everyday habits that can weaken your bone health, expert tips for stronger bones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/28/original/strong_bones_1743165283530.webp" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Here's how you can improve bone health.(Unsplash)" title="Here's how you can improve bone health.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Here's how you can improve bone health.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Importance of Vitamin D for bone health:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orthopaedic surgeon explained that just calcium is not enough for optimal bone health. Vitamin D is needed for proper absorption of calcium in the body. “Vitamin D ensures that calcium reaches the bones and keeps them strong. Sunlight is the best source, as the skin naturally produces vitamin D when exposed. However, with more time spent indoors, many people don’t get enough sun, leading to a deficiency. In such cases, foods like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products can help bridge the gap.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/lifestyle-tips-for-youths-bone-health-avoid-these-modern-living-habits-to-prevent-osteoarthritis-in-young-adults-101705992745153.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle tips for youth's bone health: Avoid these modern living habits to prevent Osteoarthritis in young adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simple steps to take for stronger bones:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating calcium-rich foods, spending time in the sun, and staying active can help keep them strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple exercises like walking or jogging also make a big difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplements can help, but they should only be taken with a doctor’s advice.

Future studies will need to clarify this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite swathes of studies suggesting intermittent fasting — which &lt;span&gt;shot to prominence in the early 2010s — does work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, experts remain divided over its effectiveness and the potential long term health impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some argue that fasters usually end up consuming a relatively large amount of food in one go, meaning they don't cut back on their calories — a known way of beating the bulge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They even &lt;span&gt;warn that it may &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13210375/Fasting-16-hours-day-RAISES-risk-dying-heart-problems-double-20-year-analysis-finds.html"&gt;raise the risk of strokes, heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or early death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the new study, one group of male mice undertook an intensive form of intermittent fasting from the age of two months, allowed to eat what they wanted for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours of water only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other group followed no dietary restrictions. Both were housed together without any contact with females.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were then introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite swathes of studies suggesting intermittent fasting — which shot to prominence in the early 2010s — does work, experts remain divided over its effectiveness and the potential long term health impacts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists found that among the sexually active male mice, serotonin was present at unusually low levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Serotonin relies upon the amino acid tryptophan to be converted by the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But tryptophan can only be obtained through the diet or released via the breakdown of the body's own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As such, when levels of tryptophan are low, less serotonin will be produced. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ehninger said: 'The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited, the usual regulatory restraint was diminished.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.03.001"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers also said a similar effect was observed among younger mice who had started intermittent fasting aged two months but had only followed the diet for six months before being introduced to females. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They too, were more sexually active than mice of the same age who followed no dietary restrictions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the effect was absent in other groups – both young and old – that fasted for only a few weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Yu Zhou, an expert in neurobiology at Qingdao University, added: 'For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ehninger said: 'In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting — possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research also comes amid concern about a global sex crisis — or rather, lack of sex crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent survey revealed more than a quarter (27 per cent) of Britons are now &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-12752131/The-Great-British-SEXODUS-quarter-Britons-say-theyre-having-sex-used-15-havent-got-frisky-year.html"&gt;having less sex than they used to&lt;/a&gt;, with one in six admitting they haven't got frisky the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a Royal College of Occupational Therapists &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13063789/Britons-having-sex-week-average-one-three-admitting-break-partner-failed-impress-sheets-survey-finds.html"&gt;poll of 2,000 adults last year&lt;/a&gt;, men and women typically have sex 46 times a year — once every eight days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some have far less frequent amorous activity, with a tenth reported having sex less than once a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sex and intimacy have been linked to several health benefits, including improving the condition of your heart, reducing stress and even boosting mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:19:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Food Poisoning While Traveling: What You Should Know - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPbS1RMHR5Smc3NE9HUVZmZXV6dkhxT2owQUNyalJfaDBtX0FlX2R5NjJoNU1Hc0RCTmRDTkVjbTNGd3VaWGFTNDhyY2NFXzNUeENEM19ibHdfS294blhyRTEzajgyRE5aUVEwMnFiM0l1RS1vRWlkVllhMld2NV9SNHo5Um9leTAzdm9BTmEzTlZQZ01l?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Two cases involving possible food poisoning among tourists have raised concerns about what travelers can do to prevent and treat food-borne illnesses — not just during off-the-beaten-path adventures, but in and around resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While the cause of the recent &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/sport/miller-gardner-death-investigation-spt/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of the former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, has not been confirmed, Miller, along with other members of the Gardner family, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teen-son-ex-yankees-star-brett-gardner-not-die-asphyxia-costa-rica-off-rcna198037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;is reported to have experienced gastrointestinal distress after eating a meal while on vacation in Costa Rica.&lt;/a&gt; And a lawsuit filed this year in Toronto in connection with the food poisoning-related deaths in 2023 of 8-year-old Stephen Gougeon and his mother, April, alleges, among other things, that the Dominican Republic resort where they stayed did not take sufficient care in food handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In general, gastrointestinal illnesses among tourists — &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/travelers-diarrhea" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;travelers’ diarrhea and food poisoning&lt;/a&gt; — is especially likely to occur in countries where the water supply is unsafe. But there are also many cases of food poisoning, and hundreds of deaths, in the United States every year, and these infections can occur anywhere there are lapses in how food is handled. Raw or undercooked meat, fish and shellfish can be contaminated, and the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of high-risk foods&lt;/a&gt; includes raw eggs and unpasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Travel presents additional concerns. “People may be in places where the tap water is not necessarily safe, and they don’t have control over how food is prepared or handled,” said &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.adamratnermd.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/hassenfeld-childrens-hospital" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone&lt;/a&gt; in New York. “When you’re home, you have some control, and you have U.S. and local health department standards. It can be harder to assess safety somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents should be especially vigilant. Babies and young children are vulnerable to dehydration, which is generally the most dangerous aspect of gastrointestinal illnesses; other groups at high risk include pregnant women, older people and anyone who is immunocompromised. But even younger adults and adolescents may not realize how serious the symptoms of food poisoning can be, and when it is important to get medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;L&lt;/abbr&gt;ess than a year&lt;/strong&gt; after COVID-19 upended life as we know it and killed the first of what would become more than 7 million people, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" aria-label="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and other regulators around the world authorized the first mRNA vaccine. Co-developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the vaccine was based on new biotechnology that uses the body’s own machinery to produce disease-fighting antibodies. Authorization for a second mRNA vaccine from Moderna followed shortly after. The speed with which they were developed and distributed was unprecedented; The mumps vaccine had taken four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed was only possible thanks to the more than $330 million in federal NIH grants that had supported three decades of underlying research into mRNA. Much of the heavy lifting of discovery and even testing had been done by the time the Biden and Trump Administrations &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." aria-label="spent over"&gt;spent over&lt;/a&gt; $30 billion to develop, purchase and distribute the vaccines. Today underlying mRNA technology, which helped save &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" aria-label="millions of lives"&gt;millions of lives&lt;/a&gt;, prevent hospitalizations and mitigate instances of long Covid, is now also being used to tackle a wide range of diseases — bird flu, cancer, heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite those COVID successes — and Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" aria-label="ongoing attempts for take credit for them"&gt;ongoing attempts for take credit for them&lt;/a&gt; — the president’s administration and base are now attacking mRNA. And they’re doing it in a way that might threaten not only next-generation vaccines for the pandemics to come, but U.S. biotechnology leadership in a market estimated to be worth almost $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about mRNA vaccines is widespread, false claims that they are deadly, change people’s DNA or somehow enable mind control. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" aria-label="though widely debunked"&gt;though widely debunked&lt;/a&gt;, these conspiracies have inspired concerted efforts around the country to end federal funding for the development of vaccines and other treatments based on mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kentucky lawmakers don’t want mRNA vaccines given to minors. Idaho legislators want to ban their use for the next 10 years; Texas legislators want to ban them entirely. And, under the leadership of one of the &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" aria-label="biggest spreaders of mRNA vaccine misinformation"&gt;biggest spreaders of mRNA vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has begun a review of its investments in related vaccine research as part of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" aria-label="a looming gutting of the Department of Health and Human Services"&gt;a looming gutting of the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; that will see over 10,000 jobs cut in addition to 10,000 workers who’ve already taken a voluntary layoff. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that efforts to pull funding for mRNA vaccine research would hamstring scientists preparing for outbreaks of new diseases with pandemic risk like avian flu. “Removing federal funding of mRNA vaccine technology would compromise pandemic preparedness greatly,” he said&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“There are multiple projects aimed at using this vaccine platform against potential pandemic threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the American biotech industry, which currently has the lead in a market that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" aria-label="could be worth"&gt;could be worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; over $70 billion by 2032, that’s bad news. Already, the Department of Health and Human Services is said to be reevaluating a $590 million contract with Moderna to develop vaccines against bird flu and other flu viruses with pandemic potential. The NIH has already terminated one grant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" aria-label="studying the immune effects of mRNA vaccines"&gt;studying the immune effects of mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and researchers fear more cuts will follow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If threats to mRNA technology from American lawmakers escalate and slow its development, it could lead to a loss of American leadership in pharmaceuticals as a whole, Pitchbook Analyst Kaz Helal told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, he explained, “if the FDA approves, the world follows.” But should the U.S. slow or abandon entirely the development of new vaccines, that development will almost certainly continue abroad in Europe or China. That, Helal said, “might be a long-term disaster for the U.S.” diminishing its stature and power in biotech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes mRNA therapies so promising is exactly why they were so successful in their first use against COVID 19: They can be created or adjusted and scaled far more quickly than conventional vaccines. mRNA therapies are simply faster and cheaper to produce than antibodies or other proteins. And they don’t remain in the body for very long, reducing the risk of side effects. They work by injecting bits of mRNA, which contain genetic instructions for your body to make a particular protein. In vaccines, they stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies against disease, elegantly turning the human body into a factory for the medicine that heals it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government recognized the promise of mRNA years ago, and has funded several programs working on next generation vaccines for Covid and related coronaviruses, as well as flu viruses, that could emerge as pandemic threats. The NIH has been funding projects to develop mRNA vaccines and treatments for diseases like HIV, Oropouche fever, and cancer. Trump’s first administration invested in developing better vaccines with an &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" aria-label="executive order"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that led to the funding for mRNA vaccines. But his second now threatens to slow or even stop that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will directly impact entrepreneurs building companies off the government’s research. Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, which is developing a universal flu vaccine using mRNA technology, depends in part on funding from the NIH. He told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; his company could continue its work without federal support, but much more slowly, forfeiting the rapid progress that was so crucial during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other mRNA biotechs may not be so lucky. Helal noted that if NIH decides to stop funding mRNA research, venture emerging from smaller universities without the large endowments or industry connections of places like Stanford and Harvard will inevitably struggle — ultimately leading to fewer new companies, and fewer advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash against mRNA vaccines will likely impact other therapies being developed from the same science. A recent study found that an mRNA treatment helped keep &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" aria-label="pancreatic cancer"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; from returning after surgery.

Astrazeneca and Moderna have seen &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" aria-label="positive results"&gt;positive results&lt;/a&gt; in an mRNA drug they’re co-developing that regenerates damaged tissue in the heart. If a bill pending in the Texas legislature were to pass, all these medicines &lt;a href="https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" aria-label="would be banned"&gt;would be banned&lt;/a&gt; within the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. pulls support for mRNA therapy development, it likely won’t impact drugs that are already undergoing clinical trials, Helal said, because drugmakers will simply sell them in Asia and Europe. Big pharma companies could also shift mRNA development to friendlier places like Denmark or Germany, and just wait four years for the next administration to see if things change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But four years is a long time — potentially long enough to seriously damage American biotech’s lead. “Europe will be a solution,” Helal said. “But the risk is that it will challenge U.S. dominance in terms of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

Pictured are cows at the USDA's National Animal Disease Center research facility in Ames, Iowa (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies is deadly virus that is transmitted through saliva from infected animals like dogs, racoons, bats, coyotes and foxes. Most people get it from an animal bite or scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease moves along the spinal cord and travels to the brain, causing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early symptoms in humans include fever, headache, agitation, confusion and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients suffer agitation, restlessness, hallucinations, seizures and twitching, excessive salivation, and a fear of water or air blowing in their face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is almost always fatal once symptoms start. Only 20 cases of humans surviving rabies have been recorded in medical literature worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 5,000 animal cases of rabies are reported each year, and about 60,000 Americans seek care for potential exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than 10 Americans die from rabies every year, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;India, however, experiences 18,000 to 20,000 human rabies deaths per year, the majority of which are in children under age 15. India accounts for over one-third of the world's rabies deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only way to cure or prevent rabies is with a series of four to five vaccines, which must be given as soon as possible after someone believes or confirms to have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the central nervous system. Once symptoms appear, it is almost always fatal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows which animals are most likely to be infected with rabies in certain areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though both the CDC and World Health Organization state raw milk is not a confirmed method of rabies transmission, the drink has been blamed for rare cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1996, as cow in Massachusetts was diagnosed with rabies after being bitten by a rabid raccoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the cow was euthanized, 14 people drank raw milk from it after it was infected and fell ill. All of them were vaccinated and survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two years later, 66 people drank raw milk from another cow infected with rabies through a raccoon bite. They all survived after being vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's still unclear if rabies can spread through raw milk, pathogens like Salmonella, E coli, and listeria have all been found in the drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends all milk be pasteurized, which involves exposing it to mild heat, to kill any potential pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:20:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOLW9vVWxBcmV6TzJSeGQwVk4yQzcwbXZzZkltZGd0UmViRDlodUNmVHNnVXRDUzZra3NjT3puNU1CaU5GUjAxdTRYN01ZUGJDU3FKSVhIRTdnWkxVZnJwTTIzVHVWZndER1djV05feHY3UU4wUGlvY24za2owcHJzeG9scXpVSE0zNHFXamZHcVVFMlXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnd3bXhnS2F5OXhaVzdaaGUxSTVSc3h1YzllZnR4WjdselJvWmduV25zYWpjSWJ2Q2M4ckJhbGg5Tzl2MjJsOEs3R0ZHUnZyRl9UaGhIcm1mT003dWc4Z0txTm5sMVBKMmZPWkpyUlhXZjJFendueUs1UFotU1N3TXlLLVVMZi1zTF9lOFNVVlNfUW16dmtVaEc</guid></item><item><title>Colon Cancer Awareness: What you should know to prevent and detect colon cancer - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPLTl5ZlhkZFQ2T2FwTDZtemtNZmdCdkNVRGQtWDV1c3FYN18yREktNVVkOGtaZGJvVzRleURfX1pldXZNSm5POWhaZHhHWE00TFN6a281U2VSVUpjWC16THdKR2U4TFBaOElMRWpLa3BGbThvOVhBQk8wQVh4OW5DS3pfV2xLVWk2cFFEcnN4UXFaNFp2RHdNOWZWWDc0ZUhvall6eFVlQWpXOEF4QmRxejdtVGxBZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In fact, colon cancer has a 90% survival rate when detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding your risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer can affect anyone, but certain factors can increase your risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Most cases occur in individuals aged 50 and older.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history:&lt;/strong&gt; A family history of colon cancer or polyps can increase your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal history:&lt;/strong&gt; Previous polyps or inflammatory bowel disease heighten your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Diets high in red and processed meats, smoking, heavy alcohol use and lack of physical activity can contribute to an increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just older adults who need to be vigilant. Colorectal cancer incidence has been steadily increasing in younger Americans for the last several decades, with the sharpest rise seen in the incidence of rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, 11% of all colon cancer and 15% of all rectal cancer diagnoses were estimated to occur in individuals under age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waiting for symptoms is too late," said Christine Hachem, M.D., interim medical director of gastroenterology and digestive health for Intermountain Health. "Screening occurs when you have no symptoms and feel well. Early detection is critical to catching colorectal cancer and saving lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rise is alarming because younger patients often have more advanced cases by the time they're diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors contributing to this trend may include environmental exposures, dietary habits, and sporadic genetic mutations, Hachem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Younger individuals face unique barriers when it comes to colon cancer screenings, such as a lack of awareness about the need for screening, fear or discomfort associated with the procedure and challenges in navigating the healthcare system," said Priyanka Patel, M.D., gastroenterologist for Intermountain Health. "It's crucial for everyone, regardless of age, to understand their personal risk factors and discuss them with their healthcare provider to determine the best screening plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated national guidelines make it possible for more people to be screened with a colonoscopy and stool-based testing starting at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonoscopies are considered the gold standard for colon cancer detection. It not only detects abnormalities, but removes precancerous lesions. Intermountain Health makes it easier to schedule a colonoscopy with an online system, ensuring you have access to this vital screening option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Issara/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most patients a colonoscopy is then only needed once every 10 years, or once every five years if your doctor determines you have an increased risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier screening may be recommended for anyone with a personal history of polyps or family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have inflammatory bowel disease (with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) or other chronic conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract, talk with your doctor or a gastrointestinal specialist to determine when and how often you should be screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't delay your screenings," Hachem said. "It could save your life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other easy and convenient screening options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health offers home-based tests that are both effective and convenient, allowing you to get what you need, when you need it, without leaving your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are 45 to 75 years old with average risk may qualify for Intermountain's on-demand colon cancer screening kits. This is an option that allows you to get a test kit in the mail and send it back to the lab for testing without the need for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple, non-invasive test detects hidden blood in the stool, an early sign of colon cancer. You can complete it at home, and if the results are positive or abnormal, a follow-up colonoscopy may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cologuard:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the FIT with a DNA test, Cologuard detects abnormal DNA markers in stool samples. It's also non-invasive and can be done at home. A positive or abnormal result will require a follow-up colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why choose home-based tests?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home-based tests like FIT and Cologuard offer several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; Complete the test at home without a doctor's visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive:&lt;/strong&gt; No preparation or sedation required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for those who may have difficulty scheduling or accessing colonoscopy appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Act today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your risks and exploring your screening options are vital steps in preventing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are 45 or older, you can order an at-home colon cancer screening kit to have a test kit mailed to you without needing a doctor's visit. If you have risk factors, like a family or personal history of colon cancer or polyps, talk to your healthcare provider about getting screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Intermountain Health's on-demand services, &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/virtual-care/on-demand" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To schedule a colonoscopy, or to find a physician &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/gastroenterology/colon-cancer-screening?utm_source=WebPage&amp;amp;utm_medium=NewsMedia&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2025&amp;amp;utm_id=IH_ColonCancer&amp;amp;utm_content=Canyons" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/gastroenterology/colon-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;www.IntermountainHealthcare.org/colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewards received may be considered income and subject to tax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

But during the pandemic that progress was reversed, and the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/01/as-texas-outbreak-grows-californias-measles-vaccination-rate-struggles-to-recover-after-pandemic/"&gt;recovery since then has been slow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rates around the Bay Area continue to be higher than the state overall, in Santa Cruz County just over 91% of kindergarten students had received the recommended doses of the vaccine that provides immunity to the measles virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2023-2024KindergartenReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data released this month from the California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County is right at the threshold, but every other Bay Area county has higher than the statewide vaccination rate, though some local counties have increased their rates in the past two years, others have dropped. Alameda county has seen MMR vaccine rates drop nearly a percentage point in two years, while rates in San Francisco and Contra Costa have increased the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2023-2024 school year, California schools reported that 96.2% of kindergarten students were vaccinated against the measles — a slight drop from the previous school year, when it was 96.5%, and lower than two years before when it was 96.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s rates are still well above the nationwide average, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to have dropped to 92.7% for this past school year&lt;/a&gt;. The recommended threshold for vaccination coverage to prevent a measles outbreak is 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santa Cruz County deputy public health officer Dr. Karissa LeClair Cortez said numbers for the current school year in the county indicate another slight drop, to 91.1%, though data for all counties is not yet available from the California Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For any schools that have more than 10% of students that are conditionally admitted or overdue for immunizations, we reach out to those schools and actually do visits there to provide guidance, resources and support,” LeClair Cortez said. She also said Santa Cruz County has more students doing independent study, who aren’t required to get vaccinated, than other nearby counties, which could contribute to the low rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do worry that children and the community are at risk because of these low vaccination rates,” LeClair Cortez said. “We know that it’s out there, it’s a matter of when it will come to our local community, unfortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been over five years since the county’s last measles case, in 2019, but with measles spreading quickly in several active outbreaks around the country, the chances of it finding its way there are higher now. And there is an ever-present risk of travelers bringing it back from places where it has yet to be eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2014, there was a serious measles outbreak that started at Disneyland. Over 100 cases were associated with that outbreak, the vast majority among the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response to the Disneyland outbreak contributed to a steep increase in vaccination rates among California kindergartners over the following years. Several laws, &lt;a href="https://archive.senate.ca.gov/member-archives/2017-18/richard-pan-d-district-06" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;many authored by former state senator Dr. Richard Pan&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged vaccination and limited families’ legal recourses for avoiding otherwise-mandatory vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination rate statewide was 96.5% the year the pandemic hit, up from the low 90’s in the early 2010’s. Then schools closed, and the pandemic disrupted the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of all the vaccine preventable diseases, measles is kind of the canary in the coal mine, because it’s the most contagious of all of them,” Pan said. He is now a lecturer of public health and health policy in the Department of Public Health Sciences at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of measles cases were reported each year before the vaccine was introduced, leading to tends of thousands of hospitalizations, and 400-500 deaths a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after decades of vaccination campaigns, in 2000 measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really concerned that we’re going to lose that measles elimination status,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s outbreak in Texas has contributed to two measles deaths, one confirmed and one under investigation still, the first in the country in over a decade. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Over 300 cases are associated with the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kansas-measles-cases-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;23 reported in Kansas in recent days&lt;/a&gt;, and 10 in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all these cases circulating, “then what happens is the wildfire catches,” Pan said. To avoid a measles wildfire growing out of control “you clear the brush, you protect zones, that’s what vaccination is about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several sparks have landed in California so far this year, with &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;eight measles cases reported already, according to this week’s update from the state health department&lt;/a&gt;. All the reported cases have been related to travel, and none have yet to lead to local spread, though officials reported possible exposures at Los Angeles International Airport early this month, and in &lt;a href="https://edsource.org/updates/measles-exposure-possible-at-tuolumne-county-high-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a high school and emergency room in Tuolumne County&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long run, people realize the value of vaccination,” Pan said. “The problem is, how many people have to die or become disabled before that message finally sinks in?”&lt;/p&gt;

and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They investigated the sensitivity of the cochlea within the ear, looking at how it transmitted brain signals in response to different amplitudes and frequencies of sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is already well known that people generally have better hearing in their right ear, compared with their left, and that hearing usually declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they were surprised by their findings on the effects of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis revealed that hearing is more influenced by sex than age, with women showing an average of two decibels more sensitive hearing than men across all the populations studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study could go some way to explaining the root of many domestic disputes - that men 'simply didn't hear' a request to do chores (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is generally considered to be a very subtle difference in loudness, the researchers said it is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Turi King, co-author from the University of Bath, said: 'We were surprised to find that women had two decibels more sensitive hearing across all the populations we measured, and this accounted for most of the variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be due to different exposure to hormones during development in the womb, due to men and women having slight structural differences in cochlear anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As well as having higher hearing sensitivity, women also perform better in other hearing tests and speech perception, indicating that their brains are also better at processing the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't really know why this might be but given the detrimental effect of noise on overall health such as sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease, having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found a person's environment was the second most significant influence on their hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in forest areas had the highest hearing sensitivity and those living at high altitudes had the lowest, the team discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggest that people living in forests could have higher sensitivity because they've adapted to an environment with lots of non-human sounds, where vigilance is essential for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said men have slight differences in the structural anatomy of their cochlear compared to women, which could go some way to explaining the findings (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or, it could be due to being exposed to lower levels of pollution, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living at higher altitudes may have reduced sensitivity due to a number of reasons including the impact of lower atmospheric pressure on measurements, potential sound reduction in high altitude environments or physiological adaptations to lower oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found a difference between urban and rural populations, with those living in cities having a shift towards higher frequencies, possibly due to filtering out low frequency traffic noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patricia Balaresque, who led the study at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research in Toulouse, France, said: 'Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;Scientific Reports.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-0824a240-0bda-11f0-9357-ff7b58c0218e"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-de0eb710-5485-11e8-81b7-97b4bee0046f" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5715317/DO-MEN-THINK-THEYRE-SMARTER-WOMEN.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study has revealed men think they are smarter than their peers, even when compared to women whose grades prove they are just as smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) made the discovery after asking college students enrolled in a 250 strong biology course about their intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, students were asked to estimate their own intelligence compared to everyone in the class as well as the student they worked most closely with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts were surprised to find that women were far more likely to underestimate their own intelligence than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When comparing a female and a male student, both with a grade point average of 3.3, the male student is likely to say he is smarter than 66 percent of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A female student is likely to say she is smarter than only 54 percent of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, when asked whether they are smarter than the person they worked most with in class, the pattern continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Male students are 3.2 times more likely than females to say they are smarter than the person they are working with, regardless of whether their class partners are men or women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:39:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQd1lkSkhpYmRQeXhfTFA1MklCNW5tVC1PcmJFMDFFWmhDZUtHNTBtMWZlUHpQU0ZHTnFIcm5rZkN0TmowV0J5YVNYSmdiV0ZvQ0Vsb3FIb0hqbkM3LVZMQmRFWE5rbk9pRUxVZjR0LUROcDJlbDIzZWFYN2tIMnpKal96QllDSUxTYmxUOHdhYndZWkdYeXZPUmhfMm1laXJ3NHA0ZWRB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9EbVgxZEdxRDViTU5ta0FwTWNXdEJkdXdINkVYalN1aTFVZU5SeHFhMmw0aWlvd0xIbUE1RllaWFZpYmZ5QUFVMDhjQkQ2ZmtRa0hvYko2R29lMTZrbXB3dHZ2MmlweEU5RWRMbW9jdWJlWFZ2Yk42WE5IUTB4emlTVkpqWXBKLTFETlJUYk0xanhFSGxnbTFfNUpWRi11N2ktRnBZdFhoY0t6bw</guid></item><item><title>Human retinal stem-like cells with potential to repair vision loss discovered - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOZ0ZSTlM0Y25jSUtMZ2p3S1lZOFZRYnlEZ0Q5RFJnazhybDhldWNHMHh5OHVNTm1pWEpObDZtSnJwOVQxWGJITGp3YUxlN2Z0QVpNVVZqbTc1UGJNeEpsdzc2cnZzakgtRV9UalBNZkZrMjgwcXRMOUhLQ1N4OUxhbEs3dnA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wenzhou Medical University and collaborating institutions have identified a population of human neural retinal stem-like cells able to regenerate retinal tissue and support visual recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Vision loss caused by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+degeneration/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide. Conditions such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinitis+pigmentosa/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt; and age-related macular degeneration involve the irreversible loss of light-sensitive neural cells in the retina. While current treatments may slow progression, they do not replace damaged tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have explored whether stem cells could be used to regenerate the retina, but the existence of true retinal stem cells in humans has remained uncertain. In fish and amphibians, the outer edge of the retina houses stem cells that regenerate tissue continuously. Whether a comparable system exists in the human eye has been debated for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Identification and characterization of human retinal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; capable of retinal regeneration," &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp6864" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used single-cell and spatial transcriptomic methods to investigate the presence and identity of retinal stem-like cells in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined human fetal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal tissue&lt;/a&gt; from four donors at 21 weeks of gestation, using spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus sequencing to identify and localize cell types in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; and chromatin accessibility to detect populations with stem cell–like properties. Additional samples from donors between 16 and 22 weeks of gestation were used to confirm the location of these cells in the peripheral retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distinct population of neural retinal stem-like cells was identified in the peripheral retina of human fetal tissue. Located in the ciliary marginal zone, these cells showed molecular features consistent with self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into all major retinal cell types. Similar cells appeared in the same anatomical region of retinal organoids, with overlapping gene expression profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following injury in organoids, stem-like cells migrated into the damaged area and produced new retinal cells. Gene activity during the repair process matched patterns observed during natural fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mouse+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mouse model&lt;/a&gt; of inherited retinal degeneration, transplanted cells remained viable for up to 24 weeks. Donor cells integrated into the host retina, developed into mature retinal types, and formed connections with neighboring cells. Treated animals exhibited improved retinal structure and stronger visual responses compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human retinal stem-like cells demonstrated the capacity to regenerate tissue and restore visual function across both fetal tissue and retinal organoid models. In both injury models and transplant experiments, the cells demonstrated the ability to restore retinal structure and contribute to visual function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Post-transplantation, the cells remained viable for at least 24 weeks, differentiated into photoreceptors, ganglion cells, and bipolar cells, and formed functional synapses with host tissue. Treated mice demonstrated improved retinal morphology and performance in visual function assays across multiple time points. No intraocular tumors were observed following transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to previously studied retinal progenitor cells, this population showed broader differentiation capacity and longer-term viability. Transplanted cells contributed to retinal structure and restored visual function in mice, without adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that retinal organoids may serve as a source of human stem-like cells for future research and therapeutic development. Further studies will be needed to assess safety, immune compatibility, and effectiveness in models that more closely resemble human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They theorised that the benefit may also lie with dairy's influence on healthy gut bugs, which could be explained by the high quantity of calcium within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Calcium may help protect against cancer by binding to potentially harmful substances in the gut and promoting the death of abnormal cells,' Prof Stebbing explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Cancer Research UK data, 54 percent of all bowel cancers could be prevented by living a healthier lifestyle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Stebbing's recommendations come amid a global epidemic in bowel cancers among under 50 year-olds — many of who are otherwise fit and healthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review of 50 nations found cases in the under 50s were on the rise in over half of all nations surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, the number of younger patients with the disease has jumped 50 per cent  over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England was also found to have one of the fastest rises globally with the rate of the disease growing an average of 3.6 per cent each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts aren't entirely sure why the rise exists, but they suspect poor diet, including the increased popularity of ultra-processed foods, and a lack of exercise could be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, nearly 45,000 Brits are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter what age you are or how tough your exercise plan is – whatever physical activity you are doing is probably helping your brain, according to the largest and most comprehensive 'umbrella' review to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the massive data crunch, children and adolescents experienced the greatest benefits from exercise in memory, while the highest gains in executive function, which relates to planning and problem-solving, were seen in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="156536" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when considering cognition in general, every age group showed similar results. What's more, those benefits did not differ based on exercise intensity, duration, or session frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even video games that require physical movement showed positive effects on the brain. In fact, some of the best outcomes on cognition and memory were attributed to 'exergames', such as Pokemon Go, as well as mind-body activities, like Tai Chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an encouraging finding, as it suggests that engaging, low-impact activities can offer real cognitive benefits," &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/media-centre/Releases/2025/exercise-of-any-kind-boosts-brainpower-at-any-age/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and health researcher Ben Singh from the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most forms of exercise appear effective," SIngh and his team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;, "including light-intensity activities, exergaming, and mind-body practices such as yoga and Tai Chi, making exercise an accessible and versatile intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xtAZpskai0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-55895-0_11"&gt;meta-meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; covers 133 systematic reviews, encompassing 2,724 randomized controlled trials and more than a quarter of a million participants. It brings together an incredible amount of information to explore the relationship between exercise and cognition like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, numerous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;even short bouts of physical exercise&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-few-minutes-of-exercise-today-could-do-wonders-for-your-brain-tomorrow"&gt;do wonders&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-is-linked-to-larger-brain-volume-in-memory-and-learning-regions"&gt;memory and learning&lt;/a&gt; in the short term, and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;in the long run&lt;/a&gt; as well. In the past, however, reviews have tended to focus on how certain types of activity, like high-intensity or low-intensity exercise, might impact specific individuals, such as older adults, children, or those with cognitive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-boosts-cognition-for-people-with-adhd-study-reveals"&gt;disorders&lt;/a&gt; or neurological &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While each of these reviews has provided valuable insight into the impact that exercise can have on cognitive function and memory," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the new meta- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="156536" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, "…there is a need to comprehensively evaluate the impact of all exercises on general cognition, memory, and executive function across all populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team could only identify &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01554-4"&gt;one other umbrella review&lt;/a&gt; out there, and it focused only on healthy individuals, finding the effects of exercise on cognition were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new review considers both healthy and unhealthy participants of all ages who were included in randomized controlled trials. These trials are designed to reveal real effects, not just associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Singh and his colleagues reviewed 107 meta-analyses, they found exercise significantly improved general cognition, and this was true across all age groups and exercise modalities. Only when they split cognition into memory and executive function did they start noticing differences between these subgroups and modalities of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best cognitve outcomes, for instance, were associated with exercises that place emphasis on complex movement patterns, like yoga, Tai Chi, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_game"&gt;exergames&lt;/a&gt;. These are low-intensity exercises, and yet they could be giving our brain a unique workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the umbrella review admit that many trials they included assessed cognition in a way that looks for impairment rather than assessing variation between individual levels of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the current results are 'ceiling effects'. In other words, some individuals could benefit more from exercise, but all individuals show improvements up to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review provides robust evidence for healthcare practitioners to confidently recommend exercise as an effective intervention for enhancing general cognition, memory, and executive function in patients of all ages and health statuses," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the umbrella review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the evidence base highlights the need for further high-quality studies to confirm and refine these findings, this review provides strong support for the role of exercise in promoting cognitive function and overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;&lt;i&gt;BMSJ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Measles typically causes a red, spotty rash that starts on the face and spreads downward. Other symptoms can include fever, headache and fatigue and are often accompanied by red eyes and congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="Article__related sans"&gt;&lt;a href="/article/50798/state-of-shelby-county-herd-immunity-as-measles-spreads-to-tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;What to make of measles: The situation in Shelby County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shelby County Health Department has activated its emergency plans and will contact any person who may have been exposed to the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nick Hysmith, head of the infectious disease division at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, said it will be important to know the age of the patient and whether the person was vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot depends on the details of the case as to what the response is going to look like,” Hysmith said, including if the patient is in a high-risk population – an area with a low vaccination rate, in a daycare setting or has a compromised immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing where the case is and what population they are in, and if they had been traveling, those are huge pieces of information that will really shape what we do over the next several days and week,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="Article__related sans"&gt;&lt;a href="/article/50356/memphis-shelby-county-covid-19-pandemic-2020-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In their words: Memphis-area leaders reflect on start of COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case of measles in Tennessee was confirmed March 21 in Middle Tennessee. Health officials have not released any information about the patient, except to say the person is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, the Shelby County Health Department said the risk to the general public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think these bodies will release information as soon as they can, particularly if there really is independent and unique action that needs to be taken,” said Dr. Stephen Threlkeld, director of infectious disease at Baptist Memorial Hospital &amp;amp; Health Care Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rest assured, there will be more cases. We would be making a mistake only to worry about daycare if this happens to be a daycare case. I think we probably need to focus on doing all those things that are low-hanging fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to know about the measles vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Check with your health care provider to determine your vaccination status,” said Dr. Michelle Taylor, the department’s director and health officer. “The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, called MMR vaccine, provides the most effective protection available against measles when two doses are administered to children at the recommended ages of 12 to 15 months, with the second dose given at ages 4 to 6.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who were not vaccinated as children should get at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Those at high risk because they work in education or health care should get two doses 28 days apart, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People unsure if they were vaccinated as children should ask their health care provider if they should be vaccinated now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in infectious disease, he said, are not surprised there is now a case in Shelby County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This intensifies our need to actually take action and just think about it,” Threlkeld said. “When a case is actually in the community, it’s time to learn about the disease, to be able to recognize the disease and take any steps that are appropriate to avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="Article__related sans"&gt;&lt;a href="/article/50308/memphis-company-hera-health-solutions-vaccine-nano-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Memphis company develops vaccine nano-tech to be used by US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelby County has maintained at least a 95% MMR- immunization rate among kindergarten children for five years. But there are pockets in the city, often based on school attendance zones, where vaccination rates dip into the 70% range or lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those areas are more prone to outbreaks, local physicians say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine now is given in two doses, which, when combined, provide 98% immunity. People who were born after 1957 but before 1989, when the CDC recommended the two-shot dose, usually got only one shot, which had an efficacy of 92%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in dosage occurred because there were outbreaks in 1989, Threlkeld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those outbreaks show that the 92% efficacy of the one vaccine was not high enough to reach the 95% vaccination rate, which would be herd immunity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, the vaccine also was not a live, attenuated vaccine as it is now. People who believe they got the inactive vaccine should be revaccinated now, along with people who only got one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="Article__related sans"&gt;&lt;a href="/article/49808/experts-watch-bird-flu-h5ni" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Experts watch bird flu – H5N1 – with hands over eyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have plenty of vaccine at the present time, but there has been such an increase in demand that there may be some shortages developing here and there,” said Dr. Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The companies say they’re working hard to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 have little reason to worry, Schaffner said, because the disease is so contagious, “the chances are overwhelming that you acquired the measles infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hysmith is encouraged by the county’s high vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should remain vigilant,” he said. “I am hopeful that we can all come together as a community and get a handle on this. ... We should be able to put a stop to any ongoing outbreak pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/articlecontent&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Memphian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQT0I0aHVLR2ZYQ1JXVlZFaDRRWlpHNl9TR0ZzczYtOTlOZUJnQTNUcWZhMlYza0l5cnNFMlNBVGJPQTR3UUlIU2c4dVpQLVRkWjVjcVpjQzZCMmtaelBYWEJzbnhITkU5eDVNREc5cHNKVUxfM0x6a25MU19kTTl0bENJcThqYjcyOFpDQnAtbXBPa2dRV3A2Y0hURVA</guid></item><item><title>Jamie Nesvold Obituary March 26, 2025 - Carlin Family Funeral Service</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1KdVBxbUFXVmsxSjlsRnJlQ19IWnY4aDF5YldQX0pYa2c4NkFvTldpRHhtWXBUT2phaGJsUnVPNEctSC01c3FkcGMxOEE0VHdabUlFMWRZakdRZ0VDY29mQkxycU8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="obituary-text-main"&gt;

From Google DeepMind, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which was &lt;a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; on a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’d &lt;em&gt;pray &lt;/em&gt;for the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solving &lt;a href="https://predictioncenter.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to the &lt;a href="https://alphafoldserver.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaFold server&lt;/a&gt; and produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to her &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00911-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt;, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8072fff0-011e-478b-9806-217adef6217e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element  element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel Prize, and revolutionised drug discovery.’&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: EMBL-EBI/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In this &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn6354" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent Science study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Through &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; testing (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Solving a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9326" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old problem&lt;/a&gt;: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; the cancer protein &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C%20CDK20" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDK20&lt;/a&gt;, prevented liver cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Helping to design a “molecular syringe”, which delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05870-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;therapeutic protein payload&lt;/a&gt; into human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are companies built on AlphaFold, too. If AlphaFold is solving the lock, then &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaProteo&lt;/a&gt; provides the key. AlphaProteo uses AlphaFold’s structures to design molecules that can bind to and modulate other proteins. This has been used to generate molecules that have never been made before – to target Covid-19, cancer and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also from DeepMind, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaMissense&lt;/a&gt; tackles the problem of missense mutations – minor changes to genes, with uncertain functional impact. Despite their prevalence, we only know whether about 2% of these changes are pathogenic. AlphaMissense models the structure of the mutations using AlphaFold: if the protein structure changes, it’s probably pathogenic. This could transform the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We don’t know yet whether drugs designed using AlphaFold will pass successfully through clinical trials, and none have been tested in humans yet – only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the future, AlphaFold could enable new medicines to be discovered by individuals, could find drugs for undruggable targets, and could unlock the secrets of molecular life. (Just the other day, AlphaFold &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01093-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helped to solve&lt;/a&gt; the structure of the sperm-egg bridge that forms during fertilisation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If the first generation of drug discovery was the nature generation, which gave us aspirin (from willow tree bark), and the second was the biotech generation, which gave us Ozempic, then we’ve now moved to the third generation: the AI generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNMWI0aThhVnA4YUNoLUNCRUtkRlg5SUxMOVlycUltNXpNWHQyNjFlRFVkOFF4MlhnNXI2UWZfWllZS2x2cXVzbUZQM2VxY0hiSUtXVFQzeG1vMTZLU0Ewb0FqRk9IWEZLUmh3SjRLVzhyT1dTVk12VGpaX0hoZzNSU00tdVhOS0ZEMjY5Um1XOU80RGVUYU1YQmRmNmQtY21TSERfbnVTWldiSzQ</guid></item><item><title>5 Things Weekly News Quiz - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNY1ZDVjM1MUtzcG9PZmFoejBJelBkUDl3Y0JBczhoNkJuS1dTQU43TE5ZNUh1cV93WVVrbm1XN0p6T3NXRFU5cElvR3hkVDY4eFA2dWxieGEtSXIyTHZpb3dHWEgwSGw5SjFzMGVJLXpXTFNNT3RYdkRzUzAtd2JxMHR6SGVQQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="games-text"&gt;

Doctors discovered bile duct cancer that had 'spread everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was more advanced than we could possibly imagine,' said Ms Ainsworth, a London-based lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though Jonathan was a doctor, he didn’t get checked immediately, he waited until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once you know that there’s something wrong, get yourself checked out as soon as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earliest signs that something was wrong began in 2019, when Mr Ainsworth — a keen runner who was 'always training' — started complaining of a pain in his stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He did little about it for several months, until he noticed he had begun to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-b7098980-0bbf-11f0-88c0-cb8b99931380"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jonathan Ainsworth, 59, was 'fit and healthy' and 'always running and training' before he was diagnosed with deadly bile duct cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he eventually spoke to a doctor, he was referred for a scan which revealed severe inflammation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting for the referral, the infectious disease specialist decided to take his own bloods, with the results showing something 'wasn't right'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went off to St Mary’s Hospital and they said that he had cancer,' said Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 2019, doctors revealed he had bile duct cancer, which affects around 3,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease impacts the tubes in the digestive system that carry bile; a fluid that helps the body digest food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 20 and 25 per cent of those diagnosed at the earliest stages will survive for more than five years, compared to between two and five per cent of those who are diagnosed later, when the cancer has spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the position of the bile ducts within the body, it easily migrates to other nearby organs, like the pancreas and the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bile duct cancer can be symptomless, particularly in its earliest stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when it does cause problems, signs include changes to your bowel habits, itchy skin, high temperature, abdominal pain and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite being a doctor, he left it 'too late' to seek medical help for his stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;His widow, Thelma Ainsworth, spent years struck with guilt about not pushing her husband to see a doctor sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Some also notice yellowing of the skin and the white of the eyes — known medically as jaundice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within three weeks of Mr Ainsworth's diagnosis he had 'gone', leaving her widowed with two young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon afterwards, she found that she started blaming herself, believing it was her fault for her husband's untimely death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since the diagnosis and for many months, maybe years afterwards, I blamed myself,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[I thought] that it was somehow my fault...because I didn’t get him to check himself out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, it 'all came to a head' while she was trying to write a children’s book — something she had wanted to do for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She discovered that her grief acted as a 'blockage' to her creative writing and decided to start journaling to help her process the difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These notes became the inspiration for her first memoir,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://mybook.to/IAmAWolfTonight"&gt; I Am A Wolf Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers used a novel, unobtrusive method to track speech in real life, offering an objective window into how social interaction and cognition are linked in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was driven by a long-standing question in aging research: how do social relationships and communication impact cognitive health in older adulthood? While previous studies have shown that staying socially active can help preserve thinking and memory skills, the methods used to measure social engagement have varied widely. Researchers often rely on broad questionnaires that ask people to recall how often they’ve socialized, attended events, or talked with others—approaches that can be affected by memory errors, personal bias, and inconsistent definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these issues, the research team wanted a more direct and objective way to measure social activity. They chose to focus on one simple but revealing indicator: how much people actually speak during their day. The idea was that speech—especially spontaneous, everyday speech—is a strong signal of real-time social engagement. The researchers aimed to see whether this measure of speech could be meaningfully linked to specific cognitive abilities and life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in this topic because social engagement has been shown to be important for maintaining cognitive abilities in older adults, but measuring social activity objectively has been challenging. We wanted to explore using advanced technology to unobtrusively measure older adults’ real-life speech as an indicator of social activity, and examine how it relates to various cognitive abilities,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Neff-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Patrick Neff&lt;/a&gt;, group and scientific project lead at &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.uzh.ch/en/team/directors/neff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 83 healthy older adults living in Switzerland, aged 65 and up. Participants were part of a larger research project that monitored daily life using wearable sensors. Each person wore a small custom-built recording device, the size of a button, called the “uTrail.” This device captured 50-second audio snippets every 18 minutes during waking hours over the course of four weeks, producing a detailed sample of each person’s real-world speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_226801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226801" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-226801" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_580/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1024x580.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-300x170.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-768x435.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_750/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-750x425.jpg 750w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1140/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1140x646.jpg 1140w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1418/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003.jpg 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226801" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;uTrail clip-on device. [&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1011177/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Röcke et al.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;To analyze this large amount of data, the researchers used a machine learning algorithm called Vocalise, which was trained to identify each participant’s voice using a short, clean sample recorded in a lab. This allowed the team to automatically detect when a participant was speaking and for how long—without needing to transcribe or listen to every recording. They then calculated each person’s total “speech ratio,” or the amount of time they were talking as a percentage of the total recording time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a series of cognitive tests in the lab at the beginning of the study. These tests covered a range of mental abilities, including working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind), processing speed, verbal fluency (ability to name words quickly based on prompts), executive functioning, episodic memory, and verbal knowledge. In addition, participants provided detailed sociodemographic information, including age, gender, education, income, partner status, number of people in their household, feelings of loneliness, and a self-rating of their hearing ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical approach called Elastic Net regression, the researchers examined which variables were most strongly linked to how much people spoke in their daily lives. Three cognitive abilities stood out. People who scored higher on working memory, processing speed, and semantic fluency tests were more likely to speak more often throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels of working memory, processing speed, and semantic fluency were associated with more speech in everyday life for older adults,” Neff told PsyPost. “This suggests these cognitive abilities may be particularly important for engaging in social conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More broadly, our study demonstrates the value of using naturalistic data to gain insights into real-life behavior and cognitive functioning. By unobtrusively recording participants’ speech in their daily lives, we were able to capture authentic patterns of social interaction that may not be apparent in traditional lab-based studies. This approach provides a more ecologically valid picture of how cognitive abilities relate to social engagement in older adults’ everyday experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some sociodemographic factors also predicted speech behavior. The most powerful predictor was whether someone had a partner. Older adults without a partner—whether single, divorced, or widowed—tended to speak significantly less than those in a relationship. This supports the idea that partners play a key role in daily social interaction during later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprising finding was that people who rated their hearing as better actually spoke less. One possible explanation is that those with hearing difficulties may overcompensate by talking more to avoid the challenges of listening, or may find themselves in more one-sided conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that better subjective hearing status was associated with less speech in everyday life,” Neff said. “This was unexpected and may indicate that those with poorer hearing engage in more one-sided conversations where they do most of the talking. This could be seen as some kind of compensation strategy of individuals with bad hearing to engage with their (social) environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found no meaningful link between age and daily speech. In other words, within this relatively healthy sample of older adults, age alone did not determine how much someone talked. This may reflect the fact that all participants were cognitively intact and relatively high-functioning, so age-related decline may not have been strongly present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other big surprise was to see that age really did not have any influence on the amount of uttered own speech,” Neff explained. “Here, we might have a bias of very active and healthy older adults participating in the study (selection bias).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our partly surprising results highlight the importance of keeping an open and exploratory mindset when examining real-world data. These findings may reveal complexities in older adults’ social and cognitive functioning that are not captured by conventional research methods. Overall, this study showcases how innovative technologies and naturalistic observation can enhance our understanding of cognitive aging and social behavior in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the innovative methods and rich dataset, the study has limitations. The sample was limited to 83 people and skewed toward healthy, well-functioning older adults. That means the findings might not apply to those with cognitive impairments or more diverse backgrounds. The machine learning method, while powerful, also comes with technical constraints. For example, the software only detected speech in five-second chunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the recent developments in AI in the last two years, we already transcended the technical options of the time when this study was conducted and analyzed,” Neff noted. “We’re currently working on a follow-up paper, where we a) further analyze own vs. other speech and their interactions as well as b) further elements of the auditory scene (environmental sounds, noises, media consumption etc.).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our long-term goals are to further refine methods for unobtrusively measuring social activity in daily life and to conduct longitudinal studies examining how cognitive abilities and social engagement influence each other over time in older adults. We also aim to explore potential interventions to enhance social activity and cognitive functioning. The focus here is on real life data collection and application, using techniques like semantic activity analysis and transdisciplinary teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82144-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive abilities predict naturalistic speech length in older adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Patrick Neff, Burcu Demiray, Mike Martin, and Christina Röcke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:10:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNal9qUE9IWHBQMHRCM3NRTmhxNndiWGJHVmgxbG5QdkllekNsMFFWNV94TjcwWnMtMV9tYWFuYThEZDZIYk9wcnhBeDk0eTVtc0xjZkRpQUd3U1BtSVRwaVc3VGZvVmVkOFlBRFlVVlEwdnp3WjlRaldWUHEzU2N2VlZ3WnJpNFlYYTFyT21uS0hmYUJMQjdZenNYWmRMU2k4eVBLQmVLNkdkQ1FLRWRtVGdncG0xSXFI</guid></item><item><title>Why We Need to Embrace Stress - Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta - Podcast on CNN Audio - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNRlFZQmdOYnU4VFFvUkc0MW5MMldkMVZLUGhqdGVKNi01b090SVRSbHR5bEU3TWxLU2NSUHU3bFdzQWY1RnFueTRIajVPdDZhZlRBVkJWNVNLSDk0VFhxVTJCWk85NzIxc1JIN2UwT3k5NTJ6bVh3dUItZC1UTzlWQ21LSi0zVHdNN3Rlb3JnQ2UtYllUaVk1WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              By the time she was just eight years old, Sharon Bergquist had already lived a lifetime of stress and trauma.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              (Chanting in the protests)
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:09

              She was a young child growing up during the Iranian Revolution.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There was genuine fury here. Thousands of Iranians, most of them young, rampaged through the streets of Tehran, shouting "Down with the Shah, Death to the Shah."
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:22
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In 1979, really beginning 1978, the rapid pace at which the country went from a very peaceful situation to just utter, just turmoil.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              7000 have been killed. Emotions over the dead and the rumors of dead are high.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:42
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Protests in the streets. Food being rationed. It really became very evident that we were not safe. So we left everything and fled as quickly as anybody could get out of a country. I vividly remember being at the airport, we were the last plane to leave before Khomeini came. The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there, and how we got onto the runway, every step of it. The plane stopped in Kuwait. Because we are Jewish, they threatened to kill my father. It was a layover because they were trying to take as many people out of Iran as possible and then take us to our final destination, which was England. The airlines had to intercede on our behalf. So to save my father's life. And at every juncture, they separate men from women and children and threatened to kill the men.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Now, that type of stress, I think, for so many of us, is just unimaginable. But thankfully, Sharon and her family did make it safely to their final destination and eventually settled in Atlanta, Georgia. But even then, Sharon faced and overcame a new series of setbacks.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In eighth grade, I could not write a paragraph in English without a lot of struggle, it would take me all night. I graduated valedictorian.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Wow.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:14
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But what is really amazing to me, and the reason I wanted to sit down with Sharon, is how she reflects on all of this today.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:22
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I view it as a gift to have encountered that in early life, because it puts so much in perspective later in life of what is considered a quote, bad day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Sharon says it was those early experiences in childhood, combined with the support of her parents, that made her more resilient. She went on to attend Harvard Medical School, and today she's a stress researcher and a practicing physician who continuously uses what she learned to now help her patients.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:56
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And what I've learned from it is something that can help other people because ultimately it triggered this obsession for me, of why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences and others don't? And the amazing part of it, is that what we need to become resilient is in all of us. Like, there's nothing special about me or my family. We all have this gift in our DNA to become resilient in the face of stress. Most people just don't know how to summon that ability.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:36
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              She's got a new book called "The Stress Paradox", and in it, Dr. Bergquist goes so far as to say that certain types of stress can help us, help us prevent disease, help us even with aging.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:55
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Look, it's a bold claim and flips a lot of what we've known about stress right on its head. So today I'm going to ask Dr. Bergquist to make the case for why stress can be a good thing. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:17
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Just going back to childhood for a second, how much of your career then your focus on stress, you're writing a book about stress does go back to what you experienced as a child?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the seeds of it were there. I think in retrospect, when I connect the dots, I think that influence is huge. I don't think I made that realization until in my professional career, I became really interested in this question of is all stress harmful? Because I work with a lot of professionals that are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do, and I would put myself in that category, and so I could not help but wonder, is that a bad thing or is that a good thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a good question, because as you're saying that, I'm thinking that kind of describes me.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I live a pretty high stress life, but I'm generally pretty engaged, energetic and happy.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:20
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:20
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But I would describe myself as stressed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I would, now knowing what I know, call that good stress. Which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as stress. So for me, it's led to a complete reframing of our relationship with stress. I think I can now say with a comfortable level that, that type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting. We release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In response to stress, you're saying.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:04
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In the response to stress. And that biochemical response is so different than the simplistic stress response that we think of,
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:14
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Cortisol and adrenaline...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly. Our stress response is so much more complicated, and different types of stress trigger a different biochemical response. The stressors that are harmful are generally ones that are not predictable, and they're just unavoidable because there's so much uncertainty that leads to some of the harmful effect that is downstream. And often these stressors are not brief and intermittent. They're much more a chronic, continuous, and those are generally the ones that are harmful. When you look at resilience as this muscle, a lot of childhood events, for example, people have dealt with a lot of different forms of adversity in childhood, and there's a lot of literature on how childhood adversity can lead to long term harm throughout life. But that's your passive resilience. When you choose your stress, you are shapeshifting, an active form of resilience, because resilience is incredibly dynamic, just like building muscle is. So when we take on these good stressors, interestingly enough, the hormones we're talking about here, the dopamine for the reward for doing something meaningful, the serotonin, that joy that comes from accomplishment. The oxytocin from contributing to the greater good. That is the trifecta that mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress so we don't have to fear it all.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:51
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So at the same time, you have stress, you're also building more resilience. It's like a workout I guess, if you're thinking of it from a muscle metaphor.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:00
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Resilience is a muscle. And our ability to shape our resilience and to shape the downstream effect of that passive resilience from those childhood exposures. Is like when we could not have ever imagined. So I think that we all have this ability to choose some stressors, these good stressors, and that helps us handle the types of stressors that are unavoidable. And it's really a shifting from kind of playing defense of always trying to curb the chronic stress, fight, wrangle, draw boundaries around stress to one that is playing offense, right? So we are just going to become stronger so we can handle more stress in the future.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:50
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you don't stress yourself at all that that's bad. I mean, you're not going to get out of bed in the morning. You're not going to study for an exam, things like that. But the idea that there's all these biochemical processes that are happening in your body, that wouldn't be happening if you never challenge yourself at all. I think is is the point that you're making. You need this.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:08
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think it's because we understand stress so much better now. In the last two decades, we have cellular and molecular based technology that is looking at what happens down to a very granular level in our bodies. The stress response we're all familiar with is fight or flight, right? The release of catecholamines, the cortisol. But we have this layer of stress responses in our cells, we actually have seven cellular stress responses. And these stress responses in our cells activate our ability to moderate inflammation. So how we understand stress has changed so much. And the key really is that our stress responses are there to help us. They're there to help us adapt to our world. They've, for our entire human history, been how we have survived and thrived. But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives. At no time in human history, until the last hundred years, have we removed the natural stressors that were in our environment that were built in like food scarcity, needing to survive on edible plants, needing to have moments of intense exercise, exposure to extremes of heat and cold, mental challenges that forced you to think beyond the horizon. We have increased our lives in a way that have made our lives very comfortable, and we can get a lot of gratification very instantly. We can have access to food 24/7. The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in, and the ultimate need of our physiology to express the genes that activate the cellular stress responses. We are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:41
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's, it's it's interesting. I think anybody who says, hey, I'm going to read a book about stress, they're probably thinking I'm going to read a book about how to mitigate or reduce my stress. And in some ways, doctor, you're making the argument that go out and find yourself some.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah!
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But the right amount of stress. The point is the right amount of stress, maybe even more so than calling it good stress or bad stress, because good or bad are attributes that are very much dependent on how much you're getting.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That is such a critical point. This science of what I'm calling good stress is hormesis, it's the science of good stress from this Greek word, to excite is how hormesis was derived, and it is mild to moderate stress followed by recovery. It is not, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I would actually say that that is not good stress. The goal is to do stress with the small s, not capital S, and it's those little incremental exposures that ultimately make us stronger. Cortisol is not a good or bad hormone. Cortisol is just telling our body we need energy. You know, exercise can evoke it or we can evoke it through job situations we don't like, financial hardship. I mean, these chronic stressors that lead to your baseline level of cortisol being elevated, which is a very different scenario. So it's not that our body has a moral code. It can our body is just responding to the inputs. And if we can just change the inputs, we change the output.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Now, I want to jump in for a second and make sure you got that, Dr. Bergquist is saying that when we choose to challenge ourselves with intentional bouts of stress that can help us become more resilient to future stressors that may be outside of our control. And to be clear, although we've been talking mostly about psychological stress, Dr. Bergquist also points out that challenging our bodies can be beneficial as well. Like fasting, for example, or intermittent high intensity exercise, hot or cold therapy like saunas. They can all be ways to harness the power of good stress.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Finding tools that are accessible that awaken our natural defense against chronic disease. And I mean mental and physical chronic disease, anxiety, depression, diabetes, heart disease. To me, the fact that we can all access our body's innate defense mechanisms if we just knew how. And that stress is, interestingly, the most powerful lever for doing this became something that I felt more than just my patients needed to know about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Coming up after the break, Dr. Bergquist helps us create a life full of good stress.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              For me, doc, and I think for our a probably a lot of people, I could experience the same stress on a Tuesday and feel defeated by it, whereas on Wednesday I'm emboldened by it. And I don't always know why that is. It could be that I slept well the night before, I had a good meal, I don't know, but it's the same exact stress. And one day it crushes me and the next day I feel fueled by it. How do I summon? How does anyone summon the resilience when they need it the most?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The recovery is a really big part of this day to day variation. So you hit the nail on the head. It is how much you slept the night before. It is also a combination of what did your body go through that same day, right? If you also exercised that day, you ate fairly healthy. All these variables impact day to day resilience. So how much stress a person can handle is not just different person to person is different for the same person from day to day. So I think we can all just make note of what helps us on the days that we can sail through it. Um, the recovery piece, of course, is critical, but looking at other factors, you know, did exercise play a role? Did the amount of sunlight and how you sync'd your circadian biology make a difference? What was that first meal like? I think we could drill it down. I think most of us don't spend the time, you know, doing that kind of human experiment to figure it out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:35
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But so what do you tell somebody in that situation who comes in who's probably a pretty high stress individual and yet loves, loves what they do? How do you guide them, doctor?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:47
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the key is strategic recovery because our bodies are designed for brief, intermittent stress. That is how we grow. But our bodies need that period of recovery. So when we go through brief intermittent stress in stress mode, our bodies are getting the signal down to ourselves to become more efficient. We do a lot of repair housekeeping functions. It is in recovery that we actually reconfigure and reshape our bodies in a way that helps us handle future stress better. If you go through a period of stress and you don't allow yourself that recovery, you miss that opportunity to actually grow from that exposure to stress. So the key for people who are driven and high functioning is the stress is okay. Do not fear it. Embrace it, but plan for the recovery. And I think that that is ultimately the blueprint of how we become our strongest self, right? Stress. Recover. Repeat. Stress. Recover. Repeat. Because our bodies work through bioplasticity. And in the brain that's neuroplasticity. And we know that when we are exposed to cortisol in a mild to moderate range for a brief transient time, that tells are synapses to make stronger connections like we bind different receptors in our brain depending on the amount of cortisol. The short term, we bind mineralocorticoid receptors. That sends a signal to grow within the communications between our neurons at a high amount. In the chronic state of stress or a very intense amount of stress, cortisol starts to bind the glucocorticoid receptors, which actually prune those synaptic connections. So you want to straddle this kind of Goldilocks amount of stress followed by recovery. So you are benefiting from the stress. And what's really fascinating is yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:08
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's really fascinating. But how do you know when it is too much stress, though?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think intuitively we know. When it's bad stress, we feel exhausted, depleted. We feel we're on the verge of burnout. We want to escape. When it's good stress for energized, for motivated. We're creative. Like we just feel like it's effortless. I think we just have to tune in to our bodies, and I think we just have that knowing. And I think that that's a really good framework for every type of stress. You know, we've been talking so much about psychological stress. I will extend that to the physical stressors in the foods we eat, the type of movement, I mean, stress in a technical sense is anything that challenges your body. And whether your health habit is health promoting or taking away from your health is ultimately how do you feel afterward?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:07
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you feel like you've you've, you're in a bad stress or call it too much stress for sort of keeping this Goldilocks metaphor that what do you, what do you, you want to make sure that you're going into the stressor as sort of ready as you can be, having slept the night before, eating and all that. But if you're in that situation now where you feel like it's too much stress intuitively, you know, what do you, what do you do in that moment?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think that is your signal that you need recovery. Like when you reach that point where you feel that, you know, if you picture your cortisol level as the metric, if you just feel that is just so high that you're not even functioning effectively, you need to step away. I mean, it could be a walk outside. It could be connecting.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I read this book, which I really loved. I'm sure you've read it as well. It's my second favorite book next to yours, the the it's called "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers", Robert Sapolsky. And the point that Robert makes, I'm sure, and you read in the book is like for zebras, you know, they can be chased and while they're being chased, they're the cortisol levels and all this stress stuff goes way up. And then as soon as they're not being chased, milliseconds later, their stress levels come back down. They're happily grazing, whatever. We humans don't quite have that luxury, in part because of this phone that I'm holding up and just all the various things in our lives, so we don't get a break from it. It's that relentless nature of it. Have you seen that worsening in your own practice?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, in primary care, 60 to 90% of visits are stress related.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. Across the country, national surveys. And I would echo that that would hold for my practice.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              60 to 90% stress related.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Stress related illnesses that may manifest as headaches, irritable bowel. It comes in different forms, but that stress plays a big role in the manifestation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And has that gotten worse over time?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think that it ebbs and flows. I do think that we are at a period of heightened stress right now. I think, um, that is clearly a big contributor to a lot of illnesses that we're seeing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Too much TV, too much politics.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Haha. It is and too much information and very hard to know how to put the information in a larger perspective of whether it's just current state or whether it's just that we now have the awareness about a lot of things that our parents dealt with, but we just didn't have the same level of awareness.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right? So, it's the access to that information.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. I mean, look I say this in part in jest, but also someone who works in the news business, it's a lot. Um, it's a fire hydrant of information and a lot of it's not good. And I think just to be completely immersed in that all the time, even as someone who's in the business from a medical standpoint, you can recognize that that's not good. Finding breaks from that. By the way, are your parents still living?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              My mom is. My dad passed away November of 2022. He was a man of very few words, but what he would choose to say always carried a lot of weight because it was always very thoughtful and reflective. And the book truly is dedicated to him. It's in his memory because he had this unbelievable acceptance, stoicism and resilience and handled everything that came his way with unbelievable calm. And I now term that resilience because we know at a biochemical level that people who have that kind of resilience emit an energy that invites calm instead of chaos, that attracts rather than repels, that inspires instead of evokes fear. And my father had that. And for me, this is a way of breaking down, defining and putting terms to what is it about people like that, that become this, you know, people would describe my father as whatever corner of the room he was at, that is where you could find peace and serenity. And people would just gravitate towards him when, you know, people were in a scenario at a party or an event where they needed that sense of calm. And I feel that now I understand what is it about people who have that and the amount of synchrony in their body, in their soul that emits that type of energy. And I think we're all capable of it, and I think that we can get to that point if we are willing to go past our comfort zone, even for brief amounts of time, again followed by recovery, because that is the path of getting there. That is how we create this positive, virtuous cycle in our world. And I hope that everyone makes that investment in themselves, because ultimately it's an investment in other people.

Why? Because when I parked my car at the grocery store, I made the mistake of twisting around to grab shopping bags from the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I felt a zing of pain in the middle of my back. Uh oh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db415-H.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that over a third of U.S. adults have experienced back pain during a three-month period — but few treatments actually work, according to a new &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/well/lower-back-pain-treatments-nsaids.html" title=""&gt;study that analyzed hundreds of trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So I thought it might be helpful to focus on how to prevent back pain in the first place. I’ve asked orthopedic doctors for their best tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7b752b55"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skip the “B.L.T.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;My car incident “is what we euphemistically call the B.L.T.,” or the bend, lift and twist, said Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins III, a neurosurgeon in New York City who specializes in spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doing all three actions at once, whether by shoveling snow or extracting a child from a car seat, “maximizes the stress on the disc, making it more likely to rupture,” Dr. Jenkins said. “As a spine surgeon, I would never do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you are about to B.L.T., take a beat and try to do each motion separately, Dr. Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When lifting an object, make sure both feet are planted and your weight is evenly distributed, said Dr. Gbolabo Sokunbi, a spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. Then lift from your legs instead of your arms and back, he said. Keep heavier items close to your body when picking them up, which puts &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="back.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74707-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;less strain&lt;/a&gt; on your spine, Dr. Sokunbi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Jacobs recalled the last significant outbreak of measles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 100 deaths nationally — including 89 in 1990, with 20 percent of those who died being from San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just something that affects children,” Jacobs noted during a presentation Thursday to the Manteca Rotary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local death toll included three adults, two of who were nurses caring for children with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 55,000 people sickened by measles in the United States between 1989 through 1991. That was the highest number in the nation since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of March 25, the California Department of Public Health has confirmed eight cases statewide. They have been in Tuolumne, Placer, Fresno, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Mateo counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 341 measles cases have been confirmed with two deaths so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 285 measles cases during all of 2024 in the United States. There were no deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s worse than COVID,” Jacobs said given there is no effective way to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the MMR vaccine that targets the prevention of the spreading of measles, mumps, and rubella) has proven extremely effective at helping prevent people from contracting measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by the Centers for Disease Control indicates for people who have not been vaccinated, the likelihood of getting measles after an exposure is all but certain, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is the fact those with measles are contagious before they show signs of being sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The MMR vaccine is effective. Two doses provide 97% protection against measles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Measles is very contagious. Measles spreads when someone infected speaks, coughs, sneezes or breathes. It can linger in the air up to two hours after the infected person has left.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Unvaccinated people are at high risk. Roughly 90% of those unvaccinated and exposed to measles will contract the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although measles were listed as  eradicated in the U.S., in 2000, the growing number of people not receiving the MMR vaccine has grown as the years have gone by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles begins with a fever that lasts a couple of days. It's followed by a cough, runny nose, pink eye, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash usually appears on the face, along the hairline and behind the ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it affects the rest of the body. Those infected can spread measles about four days before their rash starts to  show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  CDC recommends two doses of MMR vaccine for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Children: one dose at 12 months of age and another at 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Older children, adolescents and adults without documented doses of MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while those born before before 1957 likely had measles disease and developed life-long immunity and do not need MMR vaccines, Jacobs noted doubling down with shots now “doesn’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those vaccinated between 1963-1968 may have received a measles vaccine that was found to have lower effectiveness. Those who had two doses of measles vaccine are not considered to be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs said the best source of information is through public health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To contact Dennis Wyatt, email dwyatt@mantecabulletin.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Manteca Bulletin</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 08:47:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPcXhOUTJVMWRRdmlRYkhXOFN4RElvTjVOQUlnbHhqSlM1djY4aHJMdnJMU1AteS1wWVJ1MTN1UXdjMkZOTTRZWWJLNWZVRHN4bFc3dHladV9GOXBDREFTT0ZNTURvblZmLWRoTjZBTFJBbkZKOG9kc1lyWmI2R24zOGMya0ZEOTRrNk9Dd2tNRXpPVGFNYVhFMGYtQVhtM3l3Yk1uUGZuRjVtXy1O</guid></item><item><title>Tired of chronic constipation?

Dr Sethi said that he usually recommended these seeds to his patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Superseeds are regarded as the powerhouse, packed with nutritional goodness, from minerals like magnesium to gut friendly fiber. More and more seeds are being added to diets for an all rounder benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi listed out the gut benefits for each of the seeds:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Black sesame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black sesame is an underrated seed on this list, receiving less buzz on social media compared to the others. But don't be so quick to dismiss it, as black sesame has ample benefits for your struggling gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi explained, “The fiber in sesame seeds helps promote smooth bowel movement. It also contains magnesium, which relaxes intestinal muscles, improving the movement of food through the GI system. ”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flax seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flax seeds come with all-in-one benefits, going beyond gut health. Doctor pointed out hormone regulation as one of its proven benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi said, “Flax seeds are rich in fiber as well. On top of it, the lignans in flax seeds also help balance hormones and their omega 3 fatty acids, reduce gut inflammation, promoting a healthier GI system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/wholesome-delights-4-delicious-flaxseed-recipes-for-health-conscious-foodies-101706683082870.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wholesome delights: 4 delicious flaxseed recipes for health-conscious foodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are a fan favourite and have become ubiquitous in weight loss diets, appearing in everything from smoothies to puddings.

&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie; I get slightly rattled when a new TikTok fat loss trend takes off. Not just because I’ve become even grumpier about fads since I hit my thirties, but also because many fitness trends aren’t rooted in reality or research. Which brings me to the latest craze — the 30/30/30 rule. Although it’s grounded in some science, the latest fat loss method isn’t&lt;em&gt; exactly&lt;/em&gt; what it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 rule was first popularized by Tim Ferriss and then Gary Brecka. Ferriss wrote about it in his book, “The 4-Hour Body,” while Brecka took it to social media after a TEDx Talk on the topic. And so, the 30/30/30 method gained significant traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule states you should consume 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking and perform 30 minutes of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/forget-running-i-tried-this-30-minute-steady-state-workout-to-burn-calories-here-are-my-results" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/forget-running-i-tried-this-30-minute-steady-state-workout-to-burn-calories-here-are-my-results"&gt;steady-state cardio&lt;/a&gt; (SSC) like walking. Not exactly controversial, but another “rule” overpromising on fat loss nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a nutritionist, but as a trainer, I try to break down diet fads with clients. When this method came into play, I wanted to deep-dive into it. Here’s everything you need to know about the 30/30/30 method, and whether or not it could help you lose weight and burn fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-tim-ferriss-30-30-30-rule"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is Tim Ferriss' 30/30/30 rule?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the method involves consuming 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. The food you choose is entirely up to you, but it should help you feel satiated (which is common with a high-protein diet) and contain fiber. A meal of spinach, black beans, eggs and cottage cheese would count, for example. According to Ferriss, this should help you consume fewer calories by up to &lt;em&gt;30% &lt;/em&gt;across the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video (which I'm now obsessed with), Ben and his wife, fellow coach Sohee Carpenter, agree that while protein is great and 30 grams is a “solid guideline” to aim for, consuming within 30 minutes of waking isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And only steady-state cardio? Also unnecessary. After all, why would 30 minutes of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; exercise type completed &lt;em&gt;first thing&lt;/em&gt; in the morning be the perfect formula for &lt;em&gt;everyone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the thing with magic number formulas,” Carpenter says. “They are catchy and easy to market, but they are rarely scientific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that eating a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/study-suggests-you-may-need-more-protein-after-cardio-than-you-think-heres-the-real-number" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/study-suggests-you-may-need-more-protein-after-cardio-than-you-think-heres-the-real-number"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt; alongside regular exercise is proven to support healthy and sustainable fat loss. But those sexy-looking numbers are pretty much made-up. And although the approach admittedly promotes a sustainable method for fat loss, the outcome won’t ever be the same (or guaranteed) for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there's no such thing as a unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-30-30-30-rule-for-weight-loss-the-science"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the 30/30/30 rule for weight loss: The science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/counting-macros-for-beginners-how-to-track-your-macros-for-fat-loss-and-muscle-growth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/counting-macros-for-beginners-how-to-track-your-macros-for-fat-loss-and-muscle-growth"&gt;macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; (carbs, fats and protein), carbs serve as your body’s primary source of fuel for energy during exercise.

She explains that “protein slows digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream” when consumed alongside carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can help reduce sharp blood sugar spikes and crashes, and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; research &lt;/a&gt;even suggests an increase in protein could help improve blood glucose regulation and stabilization. We know insulin resistance can inhibit weight loss and contribute to stubborn fat, so a high-protein diet could promote faster weight loss by helping to balance your blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the focus on exercise, your diet is also largely responsible for overall body composition — your fat-to-muscle ratio. Even if you spend months building muscle, your&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-calculate-your-body-fat-percentage-and-why-it-matters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-calculate-your-body-fat-percentage-and-why-it-matters"&gt; body fat percentage&lt;/a&gt; is determined by factors like lifestyle (sleep, diet, exercise),&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/slow-metabolism-this-could-be-the-secret-to-better-workouts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/slow-metabolism-this-could-be-the-secret-to-better-workouts"&gt; metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and genetics, and will subsequently help determine muscle definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the thing with magic number formulas,” Carpenter says. “They are catchy and easy to market, but they're rarely scientific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, let's discuss timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s little evidence suggesting the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-is-the-best-time-to-drink-a-protein-shake-and-its-not-when-you-think" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-is-the-best-time-to-drink-a-protein-shake-and-its-not-when-you-think"&gt;best time to consume protein&lt;/a&gt; is within 30 minutes of waking for fat loss. For some, it could even cause digestion issues. Sure, cramming 30 grams of protein into your morning is hardly a bad way to start the day — it could help reduce calorie consumption later by keeping you fuller — but overall protein intake is the most important number, preferably spread across the day, not how quickly you consume it after waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting isn’t for everyone, so if you like to eat straightaway, go ahead, just don't clock watch while you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend protein with every meal and consuming roughly 1 to 1.5 grams per kilo of body weight daily, or up to 2 grams if trying to build muscle. An&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/legacy/fnic/dri-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.nal.usda.gov/legacy/fnic/dri-calculator/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; online protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; can help you estimate your recommended protein intake if you're unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-30-30-30-rule-is-eating-in-the-morning-better-for-fat-loss"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30/30/30 rule: Is eating in the morning better for fat loss?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front-loading your day with protein could keep you full and promote healthier choices throughout the day while balancing your blood sugar and helping you to hit your daily protein target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, you don’t need to cram your protein into a 30-minute morning window. Some people prefer eating before exercising, while others may wait until they’ve finished a workout to consume food, as it makes them feel unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deciding the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/should-you-eat-before-or-after-a-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/should-you-eat-before-or-after-a-workout"&gt;best time to eat for your workout&lt;/a&gt;, there are benefits for both fasted versus fed-state training, but you won’t damage your chances of losing fat if you don’t eat within 30 minutes of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research, like this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l42" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l42" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study published in the BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that “breakfast might not be a good strategy” for some on their weight loss journey and could even have the opposite effect, although the research did have limitations and needed further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-30-30-30-is-exercising-in-the-morning-better"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30/30/30: Is exercising in the morning better?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no magic number on the timing of exercise for weight loss, either, despite fasted morning training being hailed as the best fat loss tool around. The most sustainable method to promote fat loss through exercise is through consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;best time to exercise&lt;/a&gt;, morning workouts could help you feel energized, boost your mood and improve decision-making throughout the day. For some, exercise in the morning means ticking that box before life commitments take over. Gentle movement after eating could also aid digestion, improve energy levels and contribute toward overall energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s widely thought that more vigorous exercise styles should be minimized close to bedtime (within a few hours), as this could inhibit &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;; the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol may even impact sleep latency (how long it takes to drop off into your slumber).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23851" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23851" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; supports the “promising role” of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity performed in the morning for weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, exercising in the morning doesn’t work for everyone. For some (like me), exercising later in the day when energy levels are higher leads to better performance, pre- or post-feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor is finding the time to exercise whenever it works, whether that means bite-sized workouts during the day — known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts"&gt;exercise snacking&lt;/a&gt; — or exercising later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the&lt;em&gt; type&lt;/em&gt; of exercise you do, there are benefits to all exercise, whatever you enjoy. The recommended guidelines state you should aim for a mix of resistance training and moderate to vigorous activity in your weekly routine, upward of 150 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy kicking it up a gear, there’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10048683/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10048683/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that HIIT &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;SSC can promote fat loss; HIIT is considered more efficient and can kickstart the afterburn effect known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/epoc-what-is-it-and-5-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism-and-burn-calories-fast" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/epoc-what-is-it-and-5-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism-and-burn-calories-fast"&gt;EPOC&lt;/a&gt; (Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption), when your metabolism elevates for a short time post-exercise. But it doesn’t make steady cardio redundant, which is credited with improving cardiovascular health and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t enjoy SSC, resistance training builds lean muscle mass, which is more metabolically active than fat. The more lean muscle and less fat you have, the better potential for your metabolic health. In short, there are benefits to all movement, especially when that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415300/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415300/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;exercise is combined with a high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pairing food to your workout, it’s worth remembering that your body has different uses for fat, carbs and protein to support exercise efforts (read: &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-eating-before-a-workout-boost-fat-loss-or-should-you-train-on-an-empty-stomach-we-asked-the-experts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-eating-before-a-workout-boost-fat-loss-or-should-you-train-on-an-empty-stomach-we-asked-the-experts"&gt;Can eating before a workout boost fat loss or should you train on an empty stomach? We asked the experts&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-are-there-any-risks-to-following-the-30-30-30-method"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any risks to following the 30/30/30 method?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 rule isn’t extreme (thankfully), so there are no real contraindications. However, those pregnant or dealing with a pre-existing illness or health condition should always consult a qualified medical professional before starting a new exercise or diet regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-30-30-30-method-my-verdict"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 30/30/30 method: My verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 method is rooted in some “good” science and encourages building healthier habits, but the numbers aren’t the most important factor here. To paraphrase Carpenter: they just market well. Forget 30 minutes and forget 30 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, pairing high protein intake with daily exercise can contribute to fat loss and help build lean muscle mass. If you enjoy eating and exercising first thing in the morning, there are benefits to this, too, like keeping you full and energized and front-loading consumption before the day takes over. However, following the method won’t necessarily make the weight fall off as promoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 30/30/30 method doesn’t work for your lifestyle, it's not that deep. Overall movement output and protein intake matter most, alongside a modest calorie deficit (consuming fewer calories than you burn) if your goal is sustainable fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend plenty of fiber (around 30 grams per day) to promote healthy digestion and keep you feeling satiated alongside the other macronutrients your body needs — fats and carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

Studies have worked on understanding the impact of walking in keeping one healthy including cutting down the risk of developing non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/daily-physical-activity-even-light-intensities-linked-lower-cancer-risk" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; evaluated the cancer risk reduction associated with light intensity activities such as doing errands and performing household chores. Researchers are saying this to be one of the first studies of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers examined more than 85,000 adults in the United Kingdom. The participants wore wrist accelerometers that tracked total daily activity, activity intensity, and daily step count over a period of one week. The researchers then looked at the relationship between the daily averages and incidence of 13 cancer types, including breast and colorectal cancer, previously associated with physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily physical activity reduces cancer risk by 26%&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 2,633 participants had been diagnosed with one of the 13 cancer types. Individuals with the highest total amount of daily physical activity had a 26% lower risk of developing cancer than individuals who had the lowest amount of daily physical activity," the researchers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Higher daily step count, but not the pace of the steps (step intensity), was also associated with a lower risk of cancer. Compared with cancer risk in those taking 5,000 steps per day, cancer risk was 11% lower for those taking 7,000 steps per day and 16% lower for those taking 9,000 steps per day. Beyond 9,000 steps, the risk reduction plateaued. The researchers suggested that less physically active individuals may lower their cancer risk by incorporating more walking, at any pace, into their daily routine," the researchers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate walking into your daily routine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the easiest and most effective ways to stay active and improve overall health.

As &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/12/alcohol-consumption-industry/" target="_blank"&gt;more Americans drink less&lt;/a&gt;, one question that has come up is whether casual drinking, or drinking alcohol infrequently, increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2SOVDF7K5BHHDWZLSOPAAOXFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The answer is “probably,” though at a very low level. Cancer risk is not binary: Having one drink, or smoking one cigarette, will not cause cancer. In general, the more you’re exposed to a risk factor, the higher your likelihood of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WBT2M2NOZBANNDSEOVN7LWRE4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read his full response below.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Medical disinformation connected to the West Texas measles outbreak has created a new problem. Children are being treated for toxic levels of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock confirms it is treating children with severe cases of measles who are also suffering from vitamin A toxicity. According to the hospital, they have admitted fewer than 10 pediatric patients who were all initially hospitalized due to measles complications but have elevated levels of vitamin A that is resulting in abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the CDC to update its measles guidance to promote the use of vitamin A. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, recommended in an article published March 2 on FOX News to take vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate and severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a March 4 interview on Fox News, Kennedy suggested that therapies such as the use of cod liver oil — which contains vitamins A and D — were "working" in treating measles patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports from the West Texas area that cod liver oil is in high demand and a big seller at area pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hospital is informing the public to reduce consumption of vitamin A and has warned that excessive amounts of it may result in significant adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that taking vitamin A will prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has administered vitamin A in Africa to reduce mortality during measles outbreaks. This is a strategy in a part of the world with widespread malnourishment, and vitamin A deficiency compromises the immune system. However, malnourishment is not a problem in West Texas or in other locations where the measles outbreak has spread in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 320 people in Texas have contracted measles in recent weeks. Forty people have been hospitalized in the state, and one child has died in the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
