European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer Research Centre and the University of Copenhagen, using algorithmic concepts similar to those used in large language models

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one of the most comprehensive demonstrations to date of how generative AI can model human disease progression at scale, and was trained on data from two entirely separate healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Details of the breakthrough were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09529-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Medical events often follow predictable patterns,” said Tomas Fitzgerald, a staff scientist at EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). “Our AI model learns those patterns and can forecast future health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool works by assessing the probability of whether – and when – someone may develop diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease and many other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Named Delphi-2M, it looks for “medical events” in a patient’s history, such as when illnesses were diagnosed, together with lifestyle factors such as whether they are or were obese, smoked or drank alcohol, plus their age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool also looks at anonymised patient record data to predict what might happen over the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool was trained and tested on anonymised patient data from 400,000 people in the UK Biobank study and 1.9 million patients in the Danish national patient registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health risks are expressed as rates over time, similar to forecasting a 70% chance of rain at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ewan Birney, the EMBL interim executive director, said patients might be able to benefit from the tool within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You walk into the doctor’s surgery and the clinician is very used to using these tools, and they are able to say: ‘Here’s four major risks that are in your future and here’s two things you could do to really change that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I suspect everyone will be told to lose weight, and if you smoke you will be told to stop smoking – and that will be in your data so that advice isn’t going to change remarkably – but for some diseases I think there will be some very specific things. That’s the future we want to create.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said the advantage of the new AI tool over existing ones – such as the Qrisk method of calculating risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade – was “we can do all diseases at once and over a long time period. That is the thing that single disease models can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team said: “Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Moritz Gerstung, the head of the division of AI in oncology at the German &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research Centre, said: “This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNYkc3SlFfRF9GRWotblI0c0tRbFNxNkJEN1FsOXAzbGM5cVNIYzlxMU1OLW1RNzZ6RHRBc2NCZXlxNVlnLWZyMmZxYmtsejZ4d1FZSjFUM0hjY2p2QjQzM2hyUndfVzJsR3hmbmpZNy1pWVpKbGVwU0Q0cXR5cGhONjR6SFVRTWhiNzMtSl9nQlpUQ1I0MXhpRHNYb0ZVSEdLc2QwaFB4YzVPdEFnOWJxNDZHdlRKWTRXVGMyU1pSNjFkZjA</guid></item><item><title>《每日野兽》（ The Daily Beast ）假查理·柯克（ Charlie Kirk ）射击游戏因儿童色情被</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/pick-up-cold-and-flu-fighting-essentials-during-this-cvs-wellness-sale/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="cheatsheet__cheatsheet-articles-container__item__article-container__article--body"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph scouted-cheatsheet-link"&gt;Fall is nearly here, bringing crisp air, colorful leaves, and—unfortunately—the start of cold season.

class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to cancer, early detection is not just a dull public health slogan – it can literally save millions of lives. The secret sauce? Getting to know your own body and keeping those detective senses sharp for any little anomaly that pops up. Forget the stereotype that only lumps or drastic physical changes matter. In fact, being your own health detective opens the door to catching sneaky early symptoms and, with a bit of luck, tackling problems before they snowball.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="3757471395" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-3820"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Your Senses Seriously: It’s Not Just What You See&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several scientists want to set the record straight. It’s not just about visible or tangible changes. The sense of smell – yes, your humble nose – could be a surprising ally in early detection. For women in particular, attention should be paid to vaginal discharge, because any alteration in odor or consistency could potentially be an early warning sign of cervical cancer. But don’t fret needlessly! We’re not talking about minor fluctuations that happen from month to month. The real red flag is any unexpected or persistent change that sticks around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected persistent lump or bump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in vaginal discharge (odor or consistency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other bodily anomalies you can notice yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Early Detection Matters: Advice From Dr. Nikki Kanani&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General practitioner Dr. Nikki Kanani hammers home a crucial point: “By detecting risk signs at an early stage, any abnormal cell can be treated quickly before it has a chance to potentially develop into cancer.” Seems simple, right? But here’s the twist: in the early phases of many cancers – including cervical – there aren’t really obvious symptoms. That’s right, no grand announcement, no dramatic pain, not even the dreaded spontaneous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does that mean? It’s the perfect recipe for procrastination. After all, if nothing feels wrong, why go for a test? The answer is plain: because science says so. In the case of cervical cancer, the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to catch trouble before it begins is a regular &lt;strong&gt;smear test&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as a pap smear). This preventive test uses a swab to detect abnormal cells on the cervix before they have a chance to become cancerous. This may not sound like a blast, but the consequences of skipping it are far less fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those inclined to put off their test, Dr. Kanani offers gentle but firm encouragement:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“We know it can seem embarrassing and you can easily postpone it, but accept your invitation because having a check-up could save your life.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Numbers and The Enemy Behind the Curtain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, around 3,000 women develop cervical cancer, and 1,000 die from it. And who’s the villain in most cases? Persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) – a very common virus, often transmitted via sexual contact. The cold truth is that cervical cancer rarely shouts its presence in the early stages. That’s what makes regular screening so powerful: it spots abnormalities before things get out of hand, often before any symptoms would raise a single eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 3,000 women develop cervical cancer annually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly 1,000 deaths per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most cases linked to long-term infection with high-risk HPV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about statistics, though. It’s about creating a habit of self-awareness, noticing not only what you see but what you &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt;. The takeaway couldn’t be clearer: if something seems strange and it sticks around – whether it’s a lump, a lingering odor, or any other bodily weirdness – consulting a health professional promptly could make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Listen to Your Body (And Don’t Ignore That Check-Up Reminder!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap: Saving lives from cancer may be as much about your own senses as about science. Knowing what’s normal for your body allows you to spot early, subtle changes – whether they be visible, tactile, or olfactory. For women, changes in vaginal discharge, especially in odor or texture, are not to be ignored. But don’t wait for dramatic symptoms; when it comes to cervical cancer, they likely won’t show up at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful tools in the fight against cervical cancer? Observation, regular screening, and a dash of courage to accept that invitation to have a smear test. So, take a sniff, don’t be shy, and remember: embarrassment lasts minutes, but early detection can mean the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Let's skip the toxic positivity about aging. Yes, sixty is the new forty, wisdom is beautiful, and plenty of people run marathons at seventy. But bodies change. Physics doesn't care about inspirational quotes. After sixty, certain things that once required no thought become negotiations, then struggles, then impossibilities—unless you're among the genetic lottery winners who age like fine wine while the rest of us age like milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't doom and gloom. It's recognition. Because pretending these changes don't exist doesn't make them disappear; it just makes people feel like failures when biology does what biology does. Sometimes the kindest thing is honest acknowledgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reading menus in mood lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants seem to have collectively decided that ambiance means darkness. After sixty, those &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-presbyopia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presbyopic changes&lt;/a&gt; that started in your forties accelerate dramatically. Even with reading glasses, deciphering a menu in candlelight becomes archaeological work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself using your phone's flashlight, angling the menu toward the single tea light, or just ordering what you remember from last time. The waiter's recitation of specials becomes crucial because at least sound waves don't require &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542189/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;accommodation reflex&lt;/a&gt;. It's not vanity keeping you from stronger prescriptions—it's that even the strongest readers can't compete with restaurants' commitment to atmospheric obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Getting up from the floor gracefully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember dropping to the floor to play with kids or pets? After sixty, the descent might still be manageable, but the return journey requires strategic planning. You need something to push against, pull up on, or roll toward. The graceful pop-up is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about strength—it's about &lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Proprioception" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt;, balance, and joint flexibility all declining simultaneously. Your brain still remembers how to stand quickly; your knees laugh at the suggestion. You develop new strategies: always sit in chairs with arms, avoid floor-sitting cultures, master the art of the assisted rise without making it obvious you're struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Hearing conversations in busy restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background noise becomes foreground chaos. After sixty, presbycusis doesn't just reduce volume—it specifically attacks the frequencies that separate speech from noise. Restaurants become acoustic nightmares where everyone sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start choosing restaurants based on acoustics rather than food. Booths over open tables. Early dinners when it's quieter. You become expert at lip reading and context clues. "Did he say 'grape' or 'great'?" becomes a constant internal dialogue. You laugh at jokes a beat late, hoping you guessed the punchline correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Sleeping through the night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bladder becomes an alarm clock nobody asked for. After sixty, you're up at least twice, sometimes more. It's not just about prostate enlargement or weakened pelvic floors—though those contribute. Your entire sleep architecture changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep decreases, REM becomes fragmented, and your &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; shifts earlier. You wake at 3 AM with stunning regularity, then can't fall back asleep. By evening, you're exhausted but somehow still awake at midnight. The eight-hour uninterrupted sleep becomes as mythical as unicorns, existing only in memory and mattress commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Remembering why you entered a room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doorway effect—that phenomenon where crossing a threshold erases your purpose—intensifies dramatically after sixty. You stand in the kitchen, spatula in hand, wondering what culinary mission brought you here. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;working memory&lt;/a&gt; that once juggled multiple objectives now drops balls constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not dementia (usually). It's normal cognitive aging where processing speed slows and attention divides less efficiently. You develop coping mechanisms: retracing steps, saying purposes aloud, making lists for three-item grocery runs. The young laugh at their occasional senior moments; after sixty, senior moments become the default setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Recovering from a night of drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-drink maximum isn't puritanism—it's survival. After sixty, what used to be a mild morning headache becomes a two-day recovery period. Your liver processes alcohol more slowly, dehydration hits harder, and sleep disruption cascades into the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the person nursing one wine glass all evening, adding ice cubes nobody judges anymore. The days of "rallying" are over. Now, a wild night means staying up past ten, and the price for exceeding your new, pathetic tolerance is paid with compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Maintaining muscle without constant effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcopenia is cruel. After sixty, you lose &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4066461/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3-8% of muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; per decade, and that's if you're trying. Skip the gym for a month, and your body interprets it as permission to begin decomposition. What took years to build disappears in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfairness stings: you need muscle more than ever for balance and bone protection, yet maintaining it requires twice the effort for half the result. Young people grow muscle thinking about weights; you lift religiously just to slow the inevitable slide toward frailty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Regulating temperature normally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're freezing, then sweating, then freezing again. After sixty, your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;thermoregulation&lt;/a&gt; becomes as reliable as weather predictions. Your internal thermostat breaks, leaving you layering and unlayering like a neurotic onion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot flashes aren't just for menopause anymore. Night sweats soak sheets. Cold penetrates bones. You understand why Florida exists, why grandparents keep houses at 78 degrees, why that cardigan becomes permanent. Your comfort zone shrinks to about three degrees, and you're never actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Seeing clearly at all distances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive lenses become necessary evil. But after sixty, even they can't solve the &lt;a href="https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/article/presbyopia-understanding-the-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;accommodation problem&lt;/a&gt; completely. You need readers for books, different readers for computers, distance glasses for driving. Your nightstand looks like an optometry display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part? The constant swapping. Reading a menu requires one pair, seeing the waiter another. Working means computer glasses, but checking your phone needs different magnification. You develop a glasses hierarchy, chains around necks, pairs in every room. Clear vision becomes situational rather than standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Trusting a fart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one nobody discusses, but everyone experiences. After sixty, the sphincter muscles weaken, sensation dulls, and what feels like gas might not be. That confident release you've performed thousands of times becomes Russian roulette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You develop new protocols: bathroom first, trust later. Long car rides require strategic planning. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7684943/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Laughter becomes risky&lt;/a&gt;. The cough-sneeze-cross-your-legs maneuver becomes automatic. It's humiliating and universal, the great equalizer that makes billionaires and paupers equally cautious about intestinal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These impossibilities aren't death sentences—they're adjustments. The body that carried you through decades of casual abuse finally presents its bill. Some people's bills are smaller, blessed with genetics that laugh at aging. But for most of us, sixty marks when "I can't" replaces "I choose not to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange comfort is universality. Everyone heading down this path faces similar indignities. The CEO who terrorized boardrooms now squints at menus. The marathon runner plans bathroom routes. The professor who lectured without notes writes everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting these changes isn't giving up—it's growing up. The alternative to aging with limitations is not aging at all, which seems worse. So we adapt, accommodate, and occasionally rage against the dying of capabilities we took for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what they don't tell you: once you stop fighting these impossibilities, you find peace in the possible. Energy once spent denying reality redirects toward what remains. And what remains, though different and diminished in some ways, can still be enough. Not the same, not what you'd choose, but enough.&lt;/p&gt;

I scanned the page. Until it was clear I wasn’t seeing anything. Not a single word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZXTUUPXGD5HBZDA6JJ4GDRVTQY"&gt;Anyone who’s heard the “C-word” and their name in the same sentence will confirm this: You go deaf. You hear the next few words, but you don’t &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; them. Because &lt;i&gt;cancer&lt;/i&gt; reverberates in your brain like a gong until, well, it fades. However long that takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WEUHM3DBX5DGDAVXQXKT5VO32Y"&gt;It took weeks after hearing in early July that cancer was discovered in my prostate for me to begin fully hearing again, to begin thinking again without my brain interrupting: “You have cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EUNRZ5Y7YFFXBLMIIWCJLPYX5M"&gt;It blinds you, too. I learned that while sitting in my urologist’s waiting room before our first conversation about my options. My treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="THLE3GWPZRCSJO3UP552RX7ZXU"&gt;Options are a blessing and a burden — especially when life rests with the choices. Your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DO3ZZC2CYZEK5DYBEBCZSNHK3E"&gt;It took me a minute to embrace the blessing of having options, of having discovered cancer early enough — Stage 2, I was told — to be handed a sheet of paper listing seven ways to combat the disease. Of having benefitted from years of regular checkups and PSA tests. In May, I learned my latest test had spiked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="S7P5BYEVCVHPLLQ656BVO44NU4"&gt;“It’s a blessing&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; you know,” my primary physician shared. “Now, you know the fight. And you can’t fight an enemy you can’t see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GJVAW2VBN5CH3BPOXWLV6YDEFE"&gt;Still, I couldn’t yet see the options. My wife took the sheet, pulled out a pen and began reading. Within moments, she scratched out the first option: Active Surveillance. “…a course of no active treatment…” was about as far as she got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DDHMLO3XTBFO3FSNLU6IHIQ6HI"&gt;“Oh, hell naw,” we both might have said simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SKQ3JXPDYVGDNDOCJNGROP6UUM"&gt;In the urologist’s office, we listened politely as he explained the option. My cancer, he said, was “slow-moving” (whatever that meant) and that I’d get another PSA test in six or so months and if my levels had risen, I could get another biopsy and….blah, blah, blah. That last part is pretty much all I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JZ7W2IGWXRG23MGBXAC5JJM5XU"&gt;“Get this thing out of me,” was my resounding thought. Wife’s, too. So, we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KE5P4DFOOJBRLBV6LQ7Q7GJKAU"&gt;Of the remaining options, the urologist further explained robotic surgery and radiation. We asked lots of questions — as did my daughter, who was in the room via FaceTime from Los Angeles, where she lives. (My son was travelling and unable to join.) We heard all the pros and cons. We asked more questions. For well over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CETAO6GPNFHGRNPJOQJH7O4OCU"&gt;As we were wrapping up, my urologist, with whom we’d shared our Christian faith, asked: “Do you mind if I pray with you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RZZUEWYB5VC33PLDECKQDST5TY"&gt;We prayed. Right there in his office. A few minutes later in the waiting room, we prayed again with an elder from our church who had come for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CWF7HDE2DVBHHP52TZESSM3HYM"&gt;One week later, I publicly&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/johnson-i-have-prostate-cancer-and-the-faith-to-beat-it.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; shared my diagnosis and declared having the faith to beat it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N7LKXLAVFFB3DFM5XAUWPBROVE"&gt;I was not completely surprised. My father died in January 1969; I was 11 years old. Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of death among U.S. men. One in every six Black men will be diagnosed with it in our lifetimes, and we’re 2.1 times more likely to die from it than white men, according to&lt;a href="https://zerocancer.org/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Zero Prostate Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Men with a father, son or brother diagnosed with prostate cancer are up to three times more likely to develop the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C52MT3JPIVHRNI4FGX25FZMYZI"&gt;Men like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5HD3S3DHFNCQTCHBHVQAFGNNGY"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read my Conquering Cancer Chronicles columns &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HEW6O2HAMFCDNM4XSA7UMECS7Y"&gt;Throughout those early weeks after learning of my diagnosis, I gripped tightly onto my faith, which has been a lifelong journey. In my youth, our family belonged to historic Vernon A.M.E. Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the only structure that survived the 1921 Race Massacre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7XEDS7SF7JEOTJS2XRR5VS7LYE"&gt;Those seeds have been growing — in fits and starts, I confess. They’ve found fertile soil in Birmingham, where I’ve been blessed to be embraced by strong Christian communities, leaders and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6MJVQXXZ6VDCLKYWCGLIDD5WQY"&gt;It never crossed my mind to dive into the deep end with Dr. Google and research all I could about prostate cancer. Instead, I dived deeper into just one book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTDT4MQPJRCLZLKJLX2W3Y6JL4"&gt;And yet…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YQOBCFC3QJGZDDHKGVMUWJRTRE"&gt;“I’ve decided to have surgery to remove my prostate — and cancer,”&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/johnson-i-have-prostate-cancer-and-the-faith-to-beat-it.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; I wrote in that initial column&lt;/a&gt;. “Boot the alien out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LTWG6EOAHNCJTAM46HRY52BP4A"&gt;No matter your faith, whether you’re a believer or not, you’ve likely heard this: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E5ITDCS75JG7HN6MXYKKJAFSYE"&gt;I told &lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt; my plans and now, I don’t exactly recall when I began to hear: &lt;i&gt;Pause&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7MH7DTBBM5CHXBIN3AFCW74HLY"&gt;I quickly embraced living in expectation of beating prostate cancer, of eventually booting out this unwelcome visitor. One of the first scriptures that struck me was&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012%3A9&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:9&lt;/a&gt; — “… my power is made perfect in weakness…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M5EBZVEVOBEAZHYHWPBEV5UB3I"&gt;Yet I just as quickly pursued &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; plan. And even neglected one of my “go-to” scriptures, one I wear on a silver chain around my neck:&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040%3A31&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Isaiah 40: 31&lt;/a&gt; — “… those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength…,” reads one version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PKWGU2BRNFGN5ANPQDXJAFOW6Q"&gt;Reads another: “…those who wait….”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RHXUMXROXVB2FLRBO4WCFKKDKE"&gt;Of course, I sought other medical opinions. After reviewing the results of my biopsy, a urologist said, “If you were my patient, I’d recommend active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UGNS7B2HBVDQ5MRFL34DOGP2T4"&gt;Yeah, our &lt;i&gt;hell naw&lt;/i&gt; option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="42VTPWPZNNAKTMH4HVF34QT44Q"&gt;Another urologist, a longtime friend and prostate cancer survivor (he opted for surgery), added that active surveillance was “a viable option” for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36" data-gaid="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PCIIKG2QAVB75BL3J6AUTRWRKA"&gt;That’s when I began to seriously ponder it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37" data-gaid="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OVHHYMJMYZBTFA6YG2KOEOQZHA"&gt;I informed my primary urologist that I was leaning toward active surveillance. “At some point,” he said, “you’re probably going to need treatment. But I do think it’s safe to watch for now.” For more comfort, he sent samples from my biopsy for a&lt;a href="https://www.veracyte.com/decipher-prostate/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Decipher test&lt;/a&gt;, which gauges through genetics the level of risk of the cancer metastasizing within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5YZHPULZHNDLFB3SB5RMXU7AKA"&gt;I waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DFTCHPHCOVADDPMETWNF26WCVM"&gt;In early August, I attended the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists, of which I’ve been a member for 40 years. I rarely walked a few steps without a fellow member stopping me and sharing their prostate cancer journey. Many had conquered it through surgery, some through radiation. I listened and thanked them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IV6O5PPZO5CJ5KVFR3HUZRGVNY"&gt;I shared with a few that I was considering active surveillance. Only one recommended against it. “It could break away and spread,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P6ZVGCBAZNFBFNXMYJUPM7JZQI"&gt;I knew. Pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-42" data-gaid="inarticle-42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XLV6NEC3IFDBVKE6Q343NS4H6U"&gt;Soon after returning, the Decipher results arrived. “Your risk was in the low category, right at the border between low and intermediate,” the urologist said. “So, that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-43" data-gaid="inarticle-43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PSOB2BRZNEWPDCNPBYMTP6PUQ"&gt;“I’m more comfortable with you watching it based on this score than I would have been if it was high-risk,” he added. “You still have what we call unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer. But fortunately, the genetic risk score is on the low side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-44" data-gaid="inarticle-44"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LOBGSIDUMFDGLPOKDY2BJXMECY"&gt;Active surveillance.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;Constipation. “Kiwis deserve an honourable mention as they are nature’s best laxatives. Paediatricians in New Zealand don’t bother with prescribed laxatives – they just puree the whole kiwi,” says Dr Stokholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibre content:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.5g per fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as soluble fibre, kiwis contain an enzyme called actinidin, which helps move food through the digestive tract. Eat the skin for an extra hit of insoluble fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The different types of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there are two main types of fibre: soluble and insoluble? They are both important to health, and one isn’t better than the other – which is why it’s important to include both in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Soluble fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When mixed with water, soluble fibre forms a gel-like consistency, which is why it’s sometimes referred to as viscous fibre. It acts like a sponge and helps sweep cholesterol out of your intestinal tract,” says Bardwell. “Good sources include oats, beans, lentils, bananas, figs and pears. Soluble fibre is especially good for slowing the rate that food leaves your stomach, which can be helpful for keeping you feeling full, managing appetite and regulating blood glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Insoluble fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies can’t completely break down insoluble fibre. Instead it passes undigested through our gut, working its magic by bulking up our stools, preventing constipation, and helping to excrete waste matter the body no longer needs,” says Bardwell. “Good examples include cauliflower, oat bran, green beans, celery, nuts and seeds. Insoluble fibre is particularly prevalent in the skins of fruit and vegetables, so avoid peeling potatoes, parsnips and carrots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’d like to find out ideas for recipes and fibre swaps, Dr Camilla Stockholm shares recipes on Instagram at @whatyourdoctoreats, and Emma Bardwell shares tips at @emma.bardwell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxk001k3b7aymzevqha@published"&gt;My partner and I still wear KN95s indoors or in crowds. (We’re both at higher risk for COVID.) I believe masking is the considerate, sensible thing to do, but I understand not everyone feels that way, so I certainly don’t take it personally when people don’t mask around me. But if I’m traveling/sharing space with someone, I do ask that they test for COVID and then mask while we’re out and about. If they can’t or won’t do it, no problem; I just make other plans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxn001l3b7av6vgp8dm@published"&gt;My family (me, my sister, her husband, and my parents) attends a big indoor festival every year. My parents live close by, so we all stay at their house for the duration of the festival. Last year, everyone agreed to wear a mask. But at the festival, I noticed all of them taking their masks off most of the time. It was too late to make alternate arrangements, so I stayed with them, but isolated and masked around the house.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxo001m3b7ad7f2qbok@published"&gt;This year, I really want to be able to relax and take my mask off in the mornings and evenings. Given what happened last year, I’m not confident they’ll mask again, so I’m planning to rent a hotel room. I know my parents will be hurt by this. I don’t really care if they do or don’t mask when I’m not around, but I’ll admit I’m hurt that they knew it was a safety issue for me, agreed to mask during my visit, and then didn’t. I know they love me, but I felt disrespected, and I spent the festival stressed out about my COVID safety assessment being thrown out of wack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxo001n3b7aaksgjttv@published"&gt;I want to skip the uncertainty this year. What is the most painless way to broach this subject? Should I book a hotel before or after talking to them? (I think if they seemed genuinely contrite and promised to make a real effort, I would stay with them again, but I’m also not interested in leveraging my presence to extort an apology.) Am I overthinking this? Does masking even matter anymore, now that the government thinks COVID isn’t real??? I’m crashing out here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtu8c0001v3b7a7c3cy8h9@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Let Me Mask You a Question,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtu99u00233b7axtpqjbuh@published"&gt;I imagine this letter could set off an intense conversation about the risks of COVID, the current availability of vaccinations, and the extent to which asking others to mask is reasonable, given what you noted about the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/covid-vaccine-flu-shots-2025-florida-new-york-robert-f-kennedy-jr.html"&gt;government’s position on the virus&lt;/a&gt;. But none of that really matters when it comes to giving you advice about how to handle the upcoming festival. The way I see it, your goal for attending is to have fun. And it will be very hard to accomplish that if you are:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmfmtugg8002a3b7a8u11b5lc@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring your family’s masking compliance (which you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be doing, even if they apologize and promise to do better, especially if they need to eat and drink, aren’t used to keeping masks on all day, and don’t really believe in their importance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absorbing the bad vibes and eye rolls that come with asking your family to mask at the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or navigating tension over your choice to stay in a hotel because of masking noncompliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtv8or002i3b7a6x1iv62f@published"&gt;So just book your room. Your worries about what your parents, sister, and brother-in-law are doing will evaporate, and you will be able to unmask in the mornings and evenings without a care in the world. Then tell your family. Doing what you need to feel comfortable is nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtv9yu002q3b7adby1s4zx@published"&gt;That said, I’m going to suggest that you lie about your reason for choosing to stay on your own. Don’t admit that it’s about masking. As I said before, if your family is offended and there’s tension between you all, suddenly the festival will cease to be an enjoyable experience. And if that’s going to be the case, you may as well stay home! So just explain to them that you [fill in the blank]:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmfmtvctg002x3b7aot1dn3t5@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had some credit card points to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have work to catch up on in the mornings and evenings, and need the isolation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haven’t been sleeping well, and thought you’d get better rest with blackout curtains and complete silence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to use the hotel gym&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtw76x00353b7a5my1nhrp@published"&gt;This approach is dishonest, yes. It’s also fine. This small lie doesn’t harm anyone, and it avoids a lot of potential tension. If you get any pushback when you announce your plans, just breezily say, “I hear you, but I still think it will work better for me. Who doesn’t love a hotel bed?” and then change the topic and start talking about the festival acts you can’t wait to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjco003v3b7alilmn5n8@published"&gt;My husband and I are retired, and we were enjoying our lives until our next-door neighbors moved away and a couple with three beagles moved in. These dogs bark practically 24 hours a day. Asking the neighbors to control their dogs has earned us nothing but being cursed out and having the door slammed in our face. Our complaints to the city have just resulted in a few citations that obviously have had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcp003w3b7ajmq5cd1w@published"&gt;At this point, my husband and I could not sell our house to move away, even if we wanted to; no one would buy a house that sounds like it’s next to a dog kennel. My husband has gotten to the point where he says he’s ready to lace some raw hamburger meat with chocolate and raisins and throw it over their fence. Ordinarily, I would be appalled, but the endless barking has gotten to the point where I’ve developed hypertension that I’ve never had before. Assuming he’s serious, do I have permission to look the other way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq003z3b7agyemdg31@published"&gt;Repeat after me: I will not encourage or allow my husband to murder an innocent animal—even if the animal is loud. We do not kill dogs. You need to be abundantly clear with him about this, and do everything in your power to stop him if he ever seems likely to follow through on his threats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq00403b7ak5gt50oh@published"&gt;Then, put on some noise-canceling headphones on top of the kind earplugs that you shove right into your ear and take 10 deep breaths. You are safe. Your husband is safe. You are just annoyed, and you can survive being annoyed (and not take anyone else’s life) until you figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq00413b7aykbbj54m@published"&gt;When you calm down and stop plotting crimes, you will realize you have options. Take the time you would have spent averting your eyes as your husband shoved chocolate chips into a hamburger patty and escalate the issue with the city. Maybe physically go to the relevant office and explain the situation. Post on Nextdoor and ask if anyone else is having the same issue and how they’re handling it. Call the local non-emergency number if you haven’t already. Call animal control—and keep calling so your neighbors know you won’t give up. Spend a few weeks keeping a log and audio recording of the noise for your records. And if nothing has helped, bring all of this to an attorney to discuss the potential for a civil complaint. I’d rather see the law involved this way than the alternative: arresting your husband for killing a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqv004i3b7axnnynj9r@published"&gt;Lately, my friend has been a bit depressed. I’ve known her for a long time, so I know that her mom is a bit strict, but sometimes it seems unreasonable. She’s a great friend who has helped me a lot, so now I want to help her, too. I’ve been told all I can really do is be a good friend, but I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqw004l3b7a7gp8k7dd@published"&gt;I read an article sometime in the past decade or so that really stuck with me about how to support someone who’s depressed (I’ve searched everywhere for it to no avail—maybe a reader remembers it and can help me out). The advice was to forget about cheering them up, distracting them, or reminding them that they’re loved— approaches that a lot of us default to when we’re comforting someone—and instead affirm that things are hard for them and you understand that they’re really suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmudxa3006g3b7ao3qytcog@published"&gt;So if your friend says, “I just don’t even feel like doing anything! My mom has ruined my life with all her rules,” don’t say, “Hey, at least you have your health!” or “So many people love you and think you’re great!” or “Don’t worry, things will get better!” Instead, try something like, “I know it must be so hard to live with someone who doesn’t let you have any independence and gets mad at you for normal stuff. Anyone would be upset about that. I hate it for you, and I’m so sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqw004m3b7a8q08nupy@published"&gt;Really let her know that you see how bad things are for her. You should absolutely, at the right moment, ask her if there’s anything that would help, and nudge her to get support, too (it sounds like you two are teens or young adults? Maybe her school has counseling services?). And if you start to get really worried about her or think she might harm herself, tell an adult. But affirming how tough things are for her without trying to talk her out of the way she’s feeling may go a long way. So would a reminder that she’s been a great friend to you (tell her about all the specific ways!) and that you want to return the favor. It won’t cure her depression, but it might take away any hesitation she has about opening &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Fast-forward to today, and my parents and I have had a better relationship since we’ve lived in separate households. Because of a job transfer, I moved closer to my parents last month. There’s still a good 30-45-minute distance between our homes. The problem? &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/04/dear-prudence-helicopter-parents.html"&gt;I now find myself—at 40+—with a helicopter parent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy has appointed a Baton Rouge physician to the committee that recommends vaccination policies to the federal government â€” and she has repeatedly questioned COVID vaccines and other inoculations for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œI am very, very skeptical,â€� Dr. Evelyn Griffin said in 2024 while speaking toÂ &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dr+evelyn+griffin&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS1090US1090&amp;amp;oq=dr+evelyn+griffin&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQIxgnMgYIAhAAGAMyCggDEAAYgAQYogQyBwgEEAAY7wUyBggFEEUYPDIGCAYQRRg80gEJMTM0NTZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:495b5c46,vid:kWw2_PwIJig,st:0%20" target="_blank"&gt;the congregation&lt;/a&gt;Â of Rev. Tony Spellâ€™s Life Tabernacle Church near Central City. â€œFor a lot of us, the COVID experience has really opened our eyes. You know that I have a lot of concerns. One of those concerns, I would say, is about the COVID vaccine.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spell became a face of resistance to then-Gov. John Bel Edward's pandemic restrictions, defying orders to stop holding services and successfully winning a court challenge against Edwards.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GriffinÂ told the congregation concerns about the COVID vaccine prompted her to study other vaccines: what theyâ€™re made of, how theyâ€™re doing, and how those vaccines got on the childhood vaccination schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œMany physicians, like myself, are seriously questioning the vaccine schedule," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;KennedyÂ &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html%20" target="_blank"&gt;tapped Griffin Monday night&lt;/a&gt; to join the civilian Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines and vaccination policies to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. The panel is slated to meet next on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy in June forced all 17 members of the panel to resign. He promised to pick replacements with strong scientific credentials and without preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent anti-vaxxer, &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/rfk-jrs-vaccine-skepticism-a-problem-for-sen-bill-cassidy/article_2f66d50e-8f81-4344-8e31-009dd22fa2e5.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy was criticized&lt;/a&gt;Â after choosing for the panel several health care professionals who made a name for themselves on conservative media talking against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also laid off thousands of agency employees, proposed cutting the agencyâ€™s budget, pulled funding for further vaccination research using one of its most promising platforms, and fired the director of the CDC less than a month after she was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Baton Rouge Republican who chairs the Senate Health Education Labor &amp;amp; Pensions Committee, was &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/bill-cassidy-calls-for-postponing-vaccine-committee-meeting/article_be2a2046-d5df-4915-a4ad-eb67d2e2c9b9.html" target="_blank"&gt;among those raising questions&lt;/a&gt; about Kennedyâ€™s promises not to undermine the nationâ€™s vaccination protocols. A longtime promoter of vaccinations, Cassidy particularly was concerned that Kennedyâ€™s replacements for the advisory panel didnâ€™t have much experience in the sciences connected to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, after voting to confirm Kennedy to the job, he said the new secretary would consult with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy did not respond Tuesday to requests for comments. His committee is meeting Wednesday to take testimony from the CDC director who Kennedy recently fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin is an obstetrician and gynecologist who has practiced in Baton Rouge for about 20 years. Griffin praised Republican Gov. Jeff &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/national_politics/jeff-landry-clashes-with-bill-cassidy-on-louisiana-vaccines/article_5f2b76fa-c30b-4c7a-b393-d531dcf9af4a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Landry, who has been critical&lt;/a&gt; of Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A native of Poland when it was controlled by communists, Griffin grew up in Canada where her family immigrated. She moved to Baton Rouge with her husband after college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Questioning vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin said she initially didnâ€™t question vaccines because, like all medical students, she was overwhelmed with information â€“ â€œlike drinking from fire hose,â€� she said â€“ that basically spread a message of vaccines are good and as a doctor she should just memorize the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer?v=house/2022/apr/0412_22_HW%20" target="_blank"&gt;testimony in 2022 before the Louisiana House Committee on Health and Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, Griffin said that she observed in her patients â€œbizarre and rare conditionsâ€� that she couldnâ€™t pinpoint as being caused by the vaccine or by the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe average doctor is not asking questions, such as, could this be an aftereffect of the vaccine? And not asking these questions is scary as well as not scientific,â€� Griffin said when she testified in favor of an anti-COVIDÂ vaccine&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy himself testified before the same committee in 2021, before he was health secretary.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testifying in favor of another measure, Griffin said the hospitals with which she was associated had refused her requests to dig down on the data about the efficacy of vaccinations in general and the COVID medicine in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œI was told repeatedly no and that was is because they felt that would create vaccine hesitancy if someone should possibly present a counter narrative,â€� Griffin said. â€œI can tell you that there is something wrong that is going on.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

4 called "The Health Benefits of Tanning".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The advert's voiceover stated: "New research proves that moderate, responsible use of sunbeds brings major health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The ad went on to claim a recent University of Edinburgh study found "higher UV exposure whether from sunlight or tanning beds is linked to reduced deaths from cancer and heart disease".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The voiceover continued: "The research also showed that sunbed use was not associated with melanoma mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The ASA investigated after an NHS doctor complained the university study, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829224001564" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;published in a scientific journal&lt;/a&gt;, was used out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The watchdog said the study was about the link between UV exposure, including sunlight, and deaths among older adults, adding: "That differed significantly from the claims in the ad, which were focused specifically on the health benefits of sunbed use only."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The ASA also said said the age-range of the people who took part was not representative of the UK population, adding: "For those reasons, we concluded that the ad made misleading and unsubstantiated claims about the health benefits of sunbed

health benefits of using sunbeds significantly outweighed the risks, we concluded that it was irresponsible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Indigo Sun said it would comply with the ASA's request to withdraw the advert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Chief executive Frank Taylor said in a statement: "We remain disappointed that a peer-reviewed study conducted by the University of Edinburgh, one of the UK's most respected academic institutions, and based on UK Biobank data from over 360,000 participants, was not considered sufficient evidence to support the claims made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Our intention was always to share the science, not to make exaggerated or irresponsible assertions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

People’s motivations to overeat may play a role in this, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate why some people don’t benefit from GLP-1 agonists as much as others, researchers observed 92 participants with type 2 diabetes in Japan during their first year of taking GLP-1 drugs. Their &lt;a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.MdVeKMXe-2Bu-2BITFqnYKpwpYrG9aSJSXpvhXXGDX3ObsnegShxWQwqHODanc6H738E-2Bo8T8fCv1nPHsNZ52emeEe-2BHuu-2FLxRs7AQVij7YVTC3A2m0tVYz0-2FTsrQ6P5OQMI-2BEBR5flHCMVKYVhSKbIKJoTfpIDJePzLuuFb0wmYz4s-3DD9Nu_yB8pNXz8iKogugC36vxXF8jd5h9-2FtEOBOP0lptxNzsvZWv-2BQhQD6pakquPhDw34AAcftjWXS1UdOtUBR4U0ym99LGcTup4DuQ9qw8a6GqxwcbCmXo2ztgoMdqoTzqBpjswa4BKOOqLXZk5iwEJ1uf4aD7QM5y6lIhLnkIyJjblOIbI7KYmRFMeQXmvNQkdcH-2FvObYsP3fRFoxx-2FB7II3QyCNS3yYhFYaCuB2HyTkP6nAgoBk9KqZqOwnRoGMP2pdA93EBBQW4fGg40k-2Fy2FTpmWIYvsic3Ns5HLPcxe1vgcgYgGes-2FWRnBBbNXVH11d1D3RHqxUA8CaRzcyIYQ6nvl9VbubSvMCXpQlCPmcWM5uAkEr-2FBd8kldQYRfSMGjkyMsdAmLmVx7SxMwCRoDu6tA-3D-3D"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, published today in Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare, suggest that people who overeat due to external reasons—such as the sight or smell of delicious food—had greater chances of responding well to the drugs in the long term than people who overeat for emotional reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who will benefit most from GLP-1 drugs?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy,” Daisuke Yabe, senior author of the study and a professor of diabetes, endocrinology, and nutrition at Kyoto University, said in a Frontiers statement. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team revealed this by gathering data on the participants’ body weight and composition, diet, and information such as blood glucose, cholesterol levels, and relationship with food at the beginning of the treatment, three months after, and one year after. They focused on emotional eating (eating in response to negative emotions), external eating (eating because the food looks good), and restrained eating (controlling one’s diet to lose weight). While it might seem contradictory, excessive restrained eating can actually result in disordered eating, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the year, the participants experienced a statistically significant loss of body weight and lowered cholesterol levels and body fat percentage without changing skeletal muscle mass. While blood glucose levels ameliorated, the improvement wasn’t statistically significant. There were, however, some variations depending on eating behaviors. Three months after the start of the treatment, participants reported more restrained eating and less external or emotional eating. By the end of the year, though, participants had returned to their original restrained and emotional eating habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy,” said Takehiro Kato, second author of the article and a researcher from Gifu University, “Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;External eating lessened over the year of treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants reported decreased external eating throughout the entire year, and individuals that claimed high levels of external eating at the beginning of the treatment saw the greatest benefits in blood glucose levels and weight loss. On the other hand, the team didn’t identify any association between emotional or restrained eating scores at the beginning and drug benefits by the 12-month mark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While our study suggests a potential association between external eating behavior and treatment response to GLP-1 receptor agonists, these findings remain preliminary,” explained Yabe. What’s more, the team’s study was observational, and participants self-reported information, meaning the researchers revealed a potential association, not a causation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Further evidence is necessary before they can be implemented in clinical practice. Should future large-scale or randomized controlled trials validate this relationship, incorporating simple behavioral assessments could become a valuable component in optimizing treatment strategies,” Yabe concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

The kidneys play a critical role in filtering waste, balancing fluids, and maintaining electrolyte levels in the body. Poor dietary choices, particularly at breakfast, can place unnecessary strain on these vital organs. While breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, not all options are beneficial for kidney health. Some common breakfast foods can exacerbate kidney issues, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Understanding which breakfasts to avoid can help protect renal function and support long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How To Know If You Have Kidney Stones?

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/press-room/ultra-processed-foods-lead-to-higher-risk-kidney-disease-new-study-finds" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in the National Kidney Foundation found that higher consumption of processed meats was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to their high sodium and phosphorus content. These meats are high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of kidney disease over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, processed meats contain preservatives like nitrates and nitrites, which have been linked to kidney strain. Regular consumption may also contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress, further burdening the kidneys and increasing the likelihood of long-term complications. For individuals with compromised kidney function, consuming these products can accelerate kidney damage. A healthier alternative is to opt for fresh, unprocessed protein sources, such as eggs, legumes, or plant-based options, which provide nourishment without overloading the kidneys. Limiting processed meat intake and focusing on a kidney-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can further support long-term kidney function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugary cereals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary cereals are convenient, but their high sugar content and artificial additives can negatively affect kidney health. Excessive sugar intake can contribute to obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are major risk factors for kidney disease. Moreover, these cereals often lack essential nutrients, providing empty calories that fail to support overall health. Swapping sugary cereals for whole-grain options like oatmeal, bran flakes, or muesli can provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, promoting better kidney function while keeping you full and energized throughout the morning, while also stabilizing blood sugar levels, supporting heart health, and reducing long-term risks associated with chronic lifestyle-related conditions. Over time, replacing processed cereals with nutrient-dense alternatives also helps maintain digestive balance, supports immune resilience, and lowers inflammation, offering comprehensive benefits that extend beyond kidney protection and overall metabolic health. Including fresh fruits, nuts, or seeds as toppings further enhances nutritional value, boosts antioxidant intake, and offers natural sweetness without overloading the body with harmful refined sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which breakfast food do you think is most harmful to kidney health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flavored yogurts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt can be a healthy breakfast option, but flavored varieties often contain added sugars, artificial flavors, and phosphates that may silently strain the kidneys over time. High sugar intake contributes to weight gain, insulin resistance, and metabolic issues, all of which increase the likelihood of developing kidney-related problems in the long run. Phosphates, especially those found in processed dairy products, can disrupt mineral balance and harm renal function when consumed frequently or in large amounts. Regular overconsumption of these additives not only burdens the kidneys but may also trigger low-grade inflammation, raise blood pressure, and aggravate existing conditions like diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular disease. Choosing plain, unsweetened yoghurt and pairing it with fresh fruits, chia seeds, or a handful of nuts delivers beneficial probiotics, essential vitamins, and nutrients that support both digestive and kidney health, without the risks. It also helps maintain gut microbiome diversity, improves nutrient absorption, and supports sustained energy and mental clarity throughout the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pastries and baked goods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastries, muffins, and donuts may be tempting, but they’re loaded with refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and simple carbohydrates, making them poor choices for kidney-friendly breakfasts. These ingredients cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and increase the risk of obesity, which in turn puts extra pressure on already vulnerable kidneys. To make matters worse, many commercial baked goods also contain hidden trans fats that trigger inflammation and gradually compromise kidney function. Smarter alternatives include whole-grain muffins, homemade baked treats with natural sweeteners, or options prepared with minimal oil, which can satisfy morning cravings while still supporting long-term renal health and overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches are convenient but often come with excessive sodium, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. These components can elevate blood pressure, increase cholesterol levels, and strain kidney function over time. Processed meats combined with refined bread further exacerbate these risks, leaving the body more vulnerable to lifestyle-related diseases. Preparing a homemade breakfast sandwich with whole-grain bread, fresh vegetables, and lean protein offers a safer, more nourishing alternative. This approach maintains the convenience of a quick breakfast while supporting kidney health, boosting overall nutrition, and reducing long-term risks associated with processed fast food options. Thus, it is best to avoid or consume in moderation whenever possible, as regular dependence on such meals may gradually weaken metabolic balance, compromise heart health, and increase overall vulnerability to chronic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instant noodles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant noodles may seem like a quick breakfast solution, but their high sodium content poses a significant risk to kidney health. Flavor packets often contain salt and MSG, which can cause dehydration and increase blood pressure—both harmful to renal function. Over time, regular consumption of such high-sodium foods can contribute to kidney strain. Instead, preparing a homemade soup or noodle dish with low-sodium broth, fresh vegetables, and lean protein provides a nourishing, kidney-friendly start to the day without compromising taste or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also Read: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/aiims-gastroenterologist-reveals-10-gut-friendly-snacks-for-daily-health-and-digestion/articleshow/123844292.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;AIIMS gastroenterologist reveals 10 gut-friendly snacks for daily health and digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fruit juices&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial fruit juices, while often marketed as healthy, can contain high levels of added sugar and lack the fiber found in whole fruits. These sugars contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and elevated blood sugar, all of which negatively affect kidney health. The absence of fiber also causes rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Choosing whole fruits or making your own low-sugar juice allows you to enjoy the natural benefits of fruit while preserving kidney function and supporting overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pancakes and waffles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancakes and waffles made from refined flour and topped with syrup are high in simple carbohydrates and sugars, which can lead to weight gain and increased blood sugar. Syrups and toppings often contain high fructose corn syrup, which can further stress the kidneys. Opting for whole-grain versions and topping them with fresh fruit or a dollop of plain yogurt can make these breakfast favorites more kidney-friendly, offering balanced nutrition without compromising flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-that-often-go-unnoticed-according-to-a-top-ny-cardiologist/amp_articleshow/123864579.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read more: High blood pressure symptoms that often go unnoticed according to top NY cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Now, we may have a new method for significantly reducing those recurring cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania shows that actively targeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41568-020-0263-0"&gt;dormant tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; (DTCs) lingering in the bone marrow and other parts of the body can keep patients cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, patients who've been treated for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-moment-new-breast-cancer-treatment-approved-in-uk"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; are carefully monitored to see if the tumor returns. This new approach doesn't involve waiting and monitoring: instead, drugs are used to attack the root causes of a relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/no-your-cravings-arent-a-reliable-sign-of-cancer-expert-explains"&gt;No, Your Cravings Aren't a Reliable Sign of Cancer, Expert Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we just don't know when or if someone's cancer will come back – that's the problem we set out to solve," &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/pioneering-strategy-may-keep-breast-cancer-from-coming-back"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical oncologist Angela DeMichele from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that preventing recurrence by monitoring and targeting dormant tumor cells is a strategy that holds real promise, and I hope it ignites more research in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173643" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival.jpg" alt="Mouse test chart" class="wp-image-173643 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival-601x415.jpg 601w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival-600x414.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173643" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In human trials and animal tests (shown here), treatment reduced the risk of cancer returning.

Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04070-6"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to pathways and drugs that might be used to reach DTCs, leading the researchers to hydroxychloroquine (which treats autoimmune diseases), everolimus (an existing anti-cancer drug), or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of a series of tests on 51 people who had previously had breast cancer and were confirmed to have DTCs were quite dramatic. Individually, the drugs cleared up to 80 percent of the DTCs, but together they were even more effective, wiping out 87 percent of the dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the group that took both hydroxychloroquine and everolimus, all of the participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-destroy-99-of-cancer-cells-in-lab-using-vibrating-molecules):"&gt;remained cancer-free&lt;/a&gt; after three years. For those who took either drug on its own, the survival rate was still an impressive 92-93 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same positive results were seen in tests on mouse models of cancer, run before the human trials to test the effectiveness of the approach.

The next steps are to run trials with a larger number of participants and to test different drug combinations and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, breast cancer that comes back is virtually impossible to eliminate completely, which leads to a large proportion of the overall deaths from the disease, casting a shadow over how effectively it can be tackled the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lingering fear of cancer returning is something that hangs over many breast cancer survivors after they celebrate the end of treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/pioneering-strategy-may-keep-breast-cancer-from-coming-back"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; DeMichele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03877-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEPATITIS B IS A HIGHLY TRANSMISSIBLE, blood-borne disease that’s been called a “silent killer” because it can become chronic without presenting symptoms for many years—until, one day, it leads to cirrhosis or liver cancer or both. In the 1970s, arguably no state faced a bigger hepatitis B threat than Alaska, where the virus had exploded within its Native population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The infection rate in some tribes was as high as 15 percent, at a time when the national rate was no more than 1 percent. The toll was devastating, and included children who had contracted the disease at birth or during infancy, usually from their mothers or adults in close contact. In the worst cases, the infected would die from liver &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181212003306/https:/anthc.org/news/hepatitis-history-among-alaska-native-people-part-1-in-a-series-on-anthc-support-and-prevention-against-liver-disease-and-hepatitis/" rel&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; before reaching adulthood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/dr-brian-mcmahon" rel&gt;Brian McMahon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a physician who treated some of those cases, told me on the phone about one particular patient—“18 years old, 4.0 GPA, with a full ride to University of Alaska. She wanted to be a teacher.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She kept having these stomach pains,” McMahon explained, but put off a visit to the doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally—two weeks before she’s supposed to graduate—she came in to see me. She had a big mass in her liver. I biopsy-tested her for hepatitis B. She was positive, and it was liver cancer. And so I sat with her two weeks later when she died a horrible, painful death. And I’ll never forget that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope finally arrived in the early 1980s in the form of a highly effective, easily produced vaccine. State officials working with tribal leaders acted quickly, first by distributing the shot to newborns and children and caregivers—and then, within a few years, to the full tribal population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; It was a feat of logistics and medicine, with intrepid health workers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://magazine.publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/hepatitis-B-in-alaska" rel&gt;delivering doses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to some of the state’s most remote regions by single-engine plane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170809214158.htm" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; were dramatic. Alaska’s hepatitis B rate plummeted. Symptomatic cases among children within the tribes effectively &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21618565/" rel&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t had [hepatitis B-related] cancer in kids for thirty years,” said McMahon. “There are no more kids who have hepatitis B. It’s amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The success of hepatitis B vaccination in Alaska got the attention of federal officials, as did a universal hep B program that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X99004600" rel&gt;Taiwan launched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at around the same time. Among those who noticed were the scientists then serving on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which makes official recommendations for what vaccines should be on the “schedule” of inoculations that the U.S. government urges all people to follow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1991, ACIP recommended hepatitis B shots be given to the entire population, with the first of three doses administered right after birth in order to protect newborns. That became U.S. policy and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37300309/" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; nationally have been almost as striking as they were in Alaska. Acute hepatitis B cases among children have fallen by more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/well/hepatitis-b-vaccine-rfk-jr.html" rel&gt;99 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; nationwide, with rates declining among adults as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign against hepatitis B ranks as one of the most important public health accomplishments of the past few decades, as the CDC’s own &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a5.htm" rel&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; proclaims. But that achievement is now in serious jeopardy, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s crusade against vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unraveling could start as soon as this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 23:43:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdjRlZUs5WHVsU0J4SkREVnZpOVhwa0Y5QlRRdDRzN1VmUWliOGdfOEtVUGpqYzlBaFRNdFNXWnNoUVZPWVItWEpfdXJFeF9FMHk4am1RdHQzRlljZHExLXpkZTMzdnJpQmdiNFFvQjJWSnZ5RkMxZ3pGNlZITWpzWmZFVllSeU4tSWJQZHFn</guid></item><item><title>对数百万人的皮肤状况的担忧与自杀风险增加有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088407/skin-condition-atopic-eczema-suicide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults who suffer from the most common form of eczema are significantly more likely to express suicidal thoughts, concerning new research reveals today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atopic eczema is a common inflammatory condition that causes patches of itchy, cracked and dry skin, which can blister and bleed during a flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, presented at the European Academy of Dermatology &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/us-congress/index.html" id="mol-b4aa7610-9312-11f0-927c-1bbfcff83e02"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, leading dermatologists examined the link between atopic eczema and suicidal ideation in over 30,800 adults, across 27 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As one of the largest investigations of its kind, the study included over 15,200 people suffering from the condition, matched with 7,968 controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eczema patients were grouped based on when they were diagnosed with the condition—childhood, adolescence or adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire which recorded the severity of their symptoms, experience of skin-related stigmatisation, and whether they had ever experienced any suicidal thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that just over 13 per cent of adults with the common condition reported suicidal ideation—compared with just 8.5 per cent of adults without atopic eczema—regardless of symptom onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Delphine Kerob, dermatologist and contributing lead author said: 'The results highlight that the effects of atopic eczema are more than skin deep, with suicidal thoughts representing a serious and frequent concern that is often overlooked by healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 5.2million adults and 2.5million children in the UK currently suffer from moderate to severe cases of eczema &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By identifying the main risk factors behind suicidal ideation in this population, we hope this study will help healthcare professionals better recognise and address these challenges, supporting patients' overall well-being more effectively.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beyond the physical symptoms of the condition, its impact on mental health is increasingly recognised, alongside the associated risks of available treatment methods such as topical steroids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who suffer from the condition experience debilitating anxiety, depression and social stigma, alongside the daily challenges of managing their condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, younger adults, particularly those under 30, were more likely to report suicidal thoughts, as were individuals with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical features were also found to play a major role, with moderate to severe symptoms linked to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also noted that those who struggled with consistent sleep disorders, such as mixed insomnia—difficulty falling and staying asleep—and more stigmatisation were at a higher risk of such ideations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kerobe concluded: 'These findings reveal a critical insight from our study, which seeks to uncover the hidden, long-term impact of living with common inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic eczema.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 5.2million adults and 2.5 million children in the UK are thought to suffer from moderate to severe cases of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; A close-up view of Atopic Dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, one of the most common forms of eczema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is generally first treated with prescription washes and steroid creams to reduce swelling and redness. In more severe cases, immunosuppressant drugs – which can negatively affect immunity and the liver – are given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Tony Bewley, a consultant dermatologist at Bart's Health NHS Trust in London, added: 'Atopic dermatitis often has a greatly underestimated psychosocial burden for the patients and their families'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both adults and children frequently face stigmatisation, loss of confidence and bullying, sleep deprivation and overwhelming itch, which may impact their performance at school and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In severe atopic dermatitis, patients often suffer from depression, anxiety and even suicidal ideation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the NHS&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13655387/Breakthrough-jab-eczema-disappear-gets-green-light-NHS.html"&gt; announced the roll-out of a pioneering new jab called lebrikizumab&lt;/a&gt; which soothes painful symptoms by targeting a protein in the body that causes inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Bewley welcomed the new treatment that is now available on the NHS, saying: 'The addition of this therapy is an important step forward and most welcomed for patients and clinicians alike.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this inspires you to curb your drinking, there’s a variety of directions to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, if you suspect you have alcohol use disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;talk to your doctor&lt;/a&gt; or a mental health professional who is trained in substance use. &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt; maintains a database of mental health professionals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to cut back or cut out drinking, the experts who spoke to HuffPost gave a few tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you normally have three drinks on a Saturday, have two, Martinez said. Or, if you drink every night of the week, reduce the number of nights you do drink, Martinez suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might want to have more days where they just don’t drink at all ... and having no alcohol days is a good thing,” Martinez added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your drink’s percentage or Alcohol By Volume (ABV) number is also an important factor. “It’s not just how much you drink, it’s ... how much alcohol is in it,” said Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many craft breweries make high-percentage IPAs, which are often 8% or even 9% alcohol, much more than what’s considered to be a standard drink, which is a 12-ounce 5% beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you drink one high ABV beer, you’re having the equivalent of one and a half standard drinks. If you have two high ABV beers, it’s the same as having three standard drinks, Martinez said. “Having lower ABV beverages can also be a way to cut down. You just want to reduce the amount of pure alcohol that you’re getting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a wide variety of non-alcoholic beers, wines, and &lt;a href="https://tasty.co/article/hannahloewentheil/best-mocktails" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt; available at many stores, restaurants, and bars. Instead of drinking booze, you can opt for a non-alcoholic option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheller also recommended listening to podcasts like &lt;a href="https://www.soberpowered.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Sober Powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hellosomedaycoaching.com/podcast/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Hello Someday&lt;/a&gt; and reading books like “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1912023385?tag=buzz0f-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=7941958%2C1%2C10%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober&lt;/a&gt;” for support and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

But scans revealed potential complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her babies were growing but not moving in utero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not happy. I was sick most of the time. I was crying and stressed," Sam said of her third trimester. "We had no clue what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only became clear when the girls were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital leads global breakthrough in childhood cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the doctors, they ran to a corner, and everyone was so shocked in that room," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El and Ally were conjoined - attached at the pelvis.  Medical staff whisked them away before Sam could see or hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described being in shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not able to accept it suddenly when this happened," Sam said. "But then I came to my senses, like, you know, where are my kids?  I want to see them. " &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to visit her girls in the NICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen conjoined twins before, but they were looking so beautiful, so incredible," Sam said. "I started crying, and I was so happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was daunting, overwhelming, and medically challenging, but Sam was happy because El and Ally were so happy. They were joyful babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their parents believed their best life would come through a separation surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For my kids, I was really concerned about their growth, about their life," Sam said. "We were not able to go outside. If we go outside, it was so hard to explain to people around us.  It was so hard to keep our privacy. Everybody wanted to take pictures, to ask questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were health issues as well.  If one of the girls was so sick she had to be hospitalized, the other did too. If one was awake, the other twin couldn't sleep. And their parents knew, as they got older, they would want to be able to walk, run, and play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family was living in the Middle East, and Sam searched the world for the best doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just took my laptop, and I started looking for all the hospitals, articles, and research papers," Sam said. "How many conjoined twins are there in the world? What kind of conjoined twins exist?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family moved to Seattle, and within days, Sam wheeled the girls into Seattle Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, it's not often we get these patients dropping into our clinic in this way," &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" target="_blank" title="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Dr. Caitlin A. Smith&lt;/a&gt; said.  Smith is the co-director of the Reconstructive Pelvic Medicine Program at Seattle Children's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I obviously knew there was going to be a lot of work involved to evaluate them and make sure that we could separate them," Smith said.  "A lot of conjoined twins have organs or blood supply that cannot be separated. It's not safe. One of them won't be able to survive being separated because of their anatomy.  We needed to establish that their pelvic organs could be separated safely. And each of them has, you know, bladder, bowel, and gynecologic function. And so that was the main question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital opens first mental health pediatric urgent care clinic in WA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's assembled a team including urologists, gynecologists, plastic surgeons, and neurosurgeons.  "The team was ultimately about 30 people," Smith said. Counting our anesthesia team, our nursing staff.  We had great scrub techs and circulators in the OR that day that we're lucky to work with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six months, they met monthly to plan. They ran a practice session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally, when the girls were 15 months old, they went into the operating room for an 18-hour surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think about surgery all the time, and we have very focused plans. Patients are very complex, but I've never thought about an operation for six months before," Smith said. "The relief, I think, that they were separated safely was really rewarding for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, months later, El and Ally are quickly learning to use their new mobility.  Sarah Lewis and Maya King are physical therapists at Seattle Children's, working with the girls since they were discharged from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since we've seen them, they've been able to pull themselves up into standing positions and work on standing for the first time," Lewis said.  "We try to make it fun for them, to entice them to do what we're trying to get them to do. So what we're working on is some sitting to standing so that they build strength in their leg muscles and prepare their hip muscles for standing and walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another piece of their development is more emotional.  For more than a year, the twins only knew life together - then one day woke up to this dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were smiling and they were also confused, like 'What's going on and why is she in another crib?" Sam said of the girls' post-operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have different personalities, different likes and dislikes. But there's some way they're still connected with their emotions. They start noticing, 'Where's my sister and why am I here alone,' so I think they always want to be together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be together, but now it's by choice. And Sam has something she initially missed out on as a new mom. When the girls were conjoined, it was very difficult just to hold them. Now, she can finally get her cuddles. "I'm hugging them, and I'm kissing them every time," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all their progress, El and Ally have a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They still have a lot of appointments with the kidney doctors, with urology, with the plastic surgeons, and the developmental doctors.  Also, the therapies. They are getting all the therapies like feeding, speech therapy, and physiotherapy.  So we still have a lot of appointments going on, we have future surgeries," Sam said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The family established a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-conjoined-twins-thrive-and-heal?attribution_id=sl:c1411812-1bec-4f14-99a4-5f1b119cfa0e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=email" target="_blank" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-conjoined-twins-thrive-and-heal?attribution_id=sl:c1411812-1bec-4f14-99a4-5f1b119cfa0e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=email" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who would like to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 21:40:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQRWVpV1ZLb0hlZWNibWFYMFlDMHpWQm0zbjdnUUE4U0kzbXFUYnAzU3c5ZGZhM2h3bDQ2eS0zMVNzR28xWFNYRXpkMFg3NXpySGk4OHk3LWd1bmNrazdsRkZxMlAzQ2R1YmlBWFRXZHpTY3JneU5MTFprcmNHRzh3RGc1WEZ5RmQxeXBVN2U5c2pTU0tXc1lBQ0VBS3BubXprMjY1NlFjU04tWDUzU2l1Q25JTmY</guid></item><item><title>一种令人惊讶的类风湿关节炎新疗法- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5536838/a-surprising-new-treatment-for-rheumatoid-arthritis</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved a device that uses electrical stimulation to reduce inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with rheumatoid arthritis usually depend on drugs to control pain in their joints. But this summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved a different sort of treatment. It's a device that activates the body's own system for regulating inflammation. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on one of the first patients to get this device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: In the summer of 2019, just after her 30th wedding anniversary, Lynn Milam's life took a sudden turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LYNN MILAM: I had bent down in front of my kitchen sink and noticed this unusual pain in my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It was the first sign of rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the lining of joints. Milam says pretty soon, everything hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: My back, my knees, my ankles, my shoulders, my neck - my whole body had become affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Milam tried physical therapy, acupuncture, steroids and even the latest costly immune drugs. Nothing worked. Stairs were a no-go. Even a gentle touch sent pain radiating throughout her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: My children could not hug me. You know, I couldn't hold my husband's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So when her rheumatologist suggested a clinical trial, Milam said yes. The trial involved a device that delivers pulses of electricity to the vagus nerve, which carries signals between the brain and internal organs. Dr. Peter Konrad, a neurosurgeon at West Virginia University, was part of a nationwide study of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER KONRAD: It's the size of a lima bean. I mean, that's pretty cool when you think about an implant. It doesn't have wires going places. Everything's all built on a little chip, and then it's contained in a little silicone jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The stimulator, made by SetPoint Medical, is placed through a small incision in the neck. Konrad says it's a lot like devices used to control epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KONRAD: Neurosurgeons have been putting vagus nerve stimulators in for epilepsy for two decades, so it's not like we didn't know how to put a device on the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: For Milam, the operation itself was easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: I've had dental surgery that was more of a process than this surgery was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: There was a hitch, though. Because the device sits so close to the vocal cords, Milam's voice was temporarily limited to a whisper. A second procedure fixed that, but left her voice slightly lower than it had been. Milam says she'll accept that for a treatment that did what drugs could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: Three weeks in, my elbow pain was completely gone. Then my hands - my hands didn't hurt anymore, the swelling started going away. Everything started, like, going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The idea that electrical impulses could alter the immune system was not immediately embraced by the medical community. Dr. John Tesser is a rheumatologist in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHN TESSER: I, like probably all of my colleagues, was somewhat skeptical (laughter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Then Tesser began to look at how the device works. By stimulating the vagus nerve, it activates a reflex in the brain. That reflex instructs cells in the spleen to stop making inflammatory proteins called cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: This treatment is utilizing the body's own mechanism of managing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It rarely produces the sort of recovery that Lynn Milam experienced. But Tesser says the pivotal clinical trial found that patients who had not responded to even the most powerful drugs often saw meaningful improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: Thirty-five percent of the patients did achieve that in this very difficult-to-treat group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Significantly more than in a comparison group, whose stimulators had not yet been switched on. Tesser says rheumatoid arthritis may be just the first disease treated by stimulating the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TESSER: There are implications for all kinds of systemic autoimmune diseases. So we're talking multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: For Lynn Milam, the stimulator has restored her ability to climb stairs, cook and travel. It's also restored a bond with her husband, Donnie, who wanted to celebrate her recovery by renewing their vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L MILAM: So that's what we did. And that night, to me, meant more than our wedding. It was like a rebirth of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Donnie Milam says he's just happy to be back doing everyday activities with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONNIE MILAM: Walking the dogs, holding hands. Just the simple things. And hugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF SHOPAN'S "LEFT ON READ")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When your body is dehydrated, your blood—which is made mostly of water—loses volume, which may lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/electrolytes-7255607" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;electrolyte imbalances&lt;/a&gt;, including concentrated levels of sodium (salt) and other minerals in your blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Increased sodium concentrations can cause your body to release a hormone called &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;vasopressin&lt;/span&gt;, which regulates water retention and narrows your blood vessels. In turn, this increases the force—or pressure—on your blood vessel walls.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking water may help reduce these effects of dehydration in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-water-needs-for-optimal-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A common recommendation for daily water intake is about &lt;strong&gt;six to eight glasses of water a day&lt;/strong&gt;, or 64 fluid ounces. Researchers found this amount effective in multiple studies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But how much water you need can depend on many factors. These include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your sex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much you weigh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The climate you're in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much physical activity you get&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, you need more water on a hot day or if you sweat during a workout.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For blood pressure, it's also important to find a balance and get the water you need without overdoing it. You can best support your cardiovascular health by avoiding both dehydration and overhydration, which may lead to fluid overload.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In some cases, blood pressure increases due to too much water or fluid in your body. &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;Hypervolemia&lt;/span&gt; occurs when your body retains too much fluid and can't remove enough of it. Increasing overall blood volume increases stress on your blood vessel walls, leading to hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Health conditions like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/cirrhosis-overview-7501544" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt; (liver scarring), kidney disease, and heart failure are common causes of hypervolemia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Another is consuming too much salt in your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-beverages"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to water, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/healthy-drinks-8784056" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other drink options&lt;/a&gt; may help control blood pressure. Consider these options to help meet your daily needs for fluid intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beet juice:&lt;/strong&gt; Research published in 2024 suggests that drinking beet juice every day can help lower systolic blood pressure in those with high blood pressure. Nitrates in the beets widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomato juice: &lt;/strong&gt;A study of adults with high blood pressure and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad") cholesterol found that one year of drinking unsalted tomato juice every day improved both measures, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomegranate juice: &lt;/strong&gt;Because it has many polyphenols—compounds rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/what-are-antioxidants" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;—pomegranate juice may help lower blood pressure, according to a 2017 study that evaluated data from eight randomized control trials.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cranberry juice: &lt;/strong&gt;In a study of adults with excess bodyweight and high blood pressure, consuming about 16 ounces of cranberry juice a day for eight weeks helped decrease blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green or black tea: &lt;/strong&gt;Green tea may be more effective than black tea, but drinking either type can help lower blood pressure. You may have better results if you drink it daily over several months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrolyte water: &lt;/strong&gt;In one study, those who drank water with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/calcium-magnesium-potassium-blood-pressure-8549542" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium and calcium&lt;/a&gt; (electrolytes that influence how your blood vessels widen or contract) had a lower risk of high blood pressure than people who drank plain water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Potassium is another electrolyte found in some beverages that can be beneficial for lowering blood pressure. Be mindful of drinks that contain sodium, which can increase blood pressure. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-management"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration is just one of many factors may influence blood pressure. Drinking water can help as part of a broader plan for cardiovascular health that includes other heart-healthy lifestyle approaches. These tips may help:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modify your diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Increase how much potassium you eat, and reduce salt (sodium). Following a dietary plan like the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/dash-diet-7972360" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; can help you emphasize fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;Smoking raises blood pressure, but avoiding this habit helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get active: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise and 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep well: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for seven to nine hours of uninterrupted rest each night, maintaining consistent sleep and wake-up times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit drinking: &lt;/strong&gt;Excess alcohol use can also impact blood pressure, but cutting back can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/weight-management-8690478" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Manage your weight&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Reach or maintain a weight that's healthy for you through diet, exercise, or other methods your doctor may recommend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Meditation, mindfulness exercises, physical exercise, and relaxing activities, like listening to music, may help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-a-quick-review"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking enough water—about eight cups per day—may help support healthy blood pressure by protecting against dehydration, which can cause spikes in blood pressure. Alone, drinking more fluids may not treat high blood pressure, though it can play a role in managing this condition along with other lifestyle approaches and medication as needed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of those patients, 151,180 (33.92%) had a Paxlovid prescription within the treatment period, and 18,663 (4.20%) had been diagnosed as having long COVID.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjusted cumulative incidence of long-COVID estimates were 4.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.40 to 4.66) for treated patients and 4.60% (95% CI, 4.51 to 4.68) for untreated patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a small protective effects among patients aged 65 years or more, the authors said. There was no effect for other ages, and no effect seen between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it may have a small protective effect among higher-risk patients and on certain symptoms, the effect sizes are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although it may have a small protective effect among higher-risk patients and on certain symptoms, the effect sizes are negligible," the authors said. "For example, an absolute risk reduction of 0.43% among patients aged 65 years or more means that 233 people would need to be treated with Paxlovid to prevent one case of PASC [postacute sequelae of COVID-19]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They concluded, "Although some prior observational studies suggested that Paxlovid held promise as a PASC preventive, this study—with a large, nationally sampled cohort; a contemporary study period; and causal inference methodology—found that Paxlovid treatment during acute COVID-19 had no effect on subsequent PASC incidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small risk reduction in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf567/8255716"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In the second study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published today in &lt;em&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that Paxlovid offered some protection against long COVID in a retrospective cohort study where 291,433 treated patients were matched to 582,866 untreated patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was only seen, however, in older adults. A minimal effect was noted in adults ages 18 to 49, but no effect was found in adolescents.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the spring and summer of 2022 (April 1 to August 31) and had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on age (50 years and older) or underlying risk factors. Of 291,433 treated patients, 98,084 (33.7%) had one or more long-COVID symptoms and 40,147 (13.8%) had two or more symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants 65 and older, Paxlovid was associated with a 12% reduced risk of at least one long-COVID symptom (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.90).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger adults aged 18 to 49 years had a smaller 7% reduction in overall risk of long COVID (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95) and a reduced risk of some but not all individual conditions, the authors said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent studies have found that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is underutilized among older patients who are at risk of severe disease, despite the evidence of its benefits," the authors concluded. "Clinicians may consider treatment of persons with mild to moderate acute COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe disease, particularly those aged ≥50 years, not only to prevent hospitalization and death but also to mitigate possible long-term consequences."&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Coronavirus levels in California’s wastewater remain “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;very high&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as they are in much of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while some COVID indicators are rising in the Golden State, others are starting to fall — a hint that the summer wave may soon start to decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the rate at which coronavirus lab tests are coming back positive was 11.72% for the week that ended Sept. 6, the highest so far this season, and up from 10.8% the prior week. Still, viral levels in wastewater are significantly lower than during &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-02/californias-summer-covid-surge-over-how-can-we-prepare-for-next-one"&gt;last summer’s peak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest COVID hospital admission rate was 3.9 hospitalizations for every 100,000 residents. That’s a slight decline from 4.14 the prior week. Overall, COVID hospitalizations remain low statewide, particularly compared with earlier surges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of newly admitted COVID hospital patients has declined slightly in Los Angeles County and Santa Clara County, but ticked up slightly up in Orange County. In San Francisco, some doctors believe the summer COVID wave is cresting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a few more people in the hospitals, but I think it’s less than last summer,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. “I feel like we are at a plateau.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are being hospitalized tend to be older people who didn’t get immunized against COVID within the last year, Chin-Hong said, and some have a secondary infection known as superimposed bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="los-angeles-county" class="subhead"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In L.A. County, there are hints that COVID activity is either peaking or starting to decline. Viral levels in local wastewater are still rising, but the test positivity rate is declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Sept. 6, 12.2% of wastewater samples tested for COVID in the county were positive, down from 15.9% the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many indicators of COVID-19 activity in L.A. County declined in this week’s data,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health told The Times on Friday. “While it’s too early to know if we have passed the summer peak of COVID-19 activity this season, this suggests community transmission is slowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="orange-county" class="subhead"&gt;Orange County&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, “we appear to be in the middle of a wave right now,” said Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, deputy medical director of the county’s Communicable Disease Control Division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test positivity rate has plateaued in recent weeks — it was 15.3% for the week that ended Sept. 6, up from 12.9% the prior week, but down from 17.9% the week before that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is still prompting people to seek urgent medical care, however.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The green-Mediterranean diet may protect against brain aging by reducing protein markers linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting a green-Mediterranean diet, which incorporates green tea and the aquatic plant Mankai, has been linked to slower brain aging, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, was conducted by scientists from Ben-Gurion University, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the University of Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Investigating diet and brain age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurological disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease are often associated with an increased brain age gap, meaning the brain appears biologically older than a person’s actual age. To explore whether diet could influence this process, researchers examined data from nearly 300 participants in the DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the most extensive long-term studies on diet and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over an 18-month period, participants followed one of three diets: a standard healthy diet; a traditional calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, which limited simple carbohydrates, emphasized vegetables, and replaced red meat with poultry and fish; or the green-Mediterranean diet, which included all of the above along with green tea and Mankai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers measured protein levels in the participants’ blood, they found that higher levels of certain proteins were associated with accelerated brain aging. Further, they found that those protein levels decreased in participants who followed the green-Mediterranean diet. The researchers hypothesized that the protective effect of the diet could be a result of the anti-inflammatory molecules contained in green tea and Mankai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A dynamic view of brain health&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Studying the circulating proteins in blood allows us to observe, in a real-life setting, how the brain’s aging processes are influenced by lifestyle and dietary changes,” said Anat Meir, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Chan School, who co-led the study. “This approach gives us a dynamic window into brain health, helping to reveal biological changes long before symptoms may appear. By mapping these protein signatures, we gain powerful new insight into how interventions, such as diet, may help preserve cognitive function as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;

But extracting enough of the molecules to serve the entire population would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-e7e3aab0-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; scientists have invented a method to produce these cancer-fighting compounds in a laboratory by using common chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer afflicts an estimated 42,000 Americans every year and kills about 30,000 annually. Incidence rates for the disease &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947621/Liver-cancer-surging-rates-50s-obesity.html"&gt;have more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; since 1980, while the death rates have more than doubled during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William Chain, associate professor in the university's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: ‘The majority of clinically approved medicines are either made from a natural product or are based on one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But there aren't enough natural resources to make enough treatments. Now chemists will be able to take our manuscripts and basically follow our "recipe" and they can make it themselves.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many medicines, both over-the-counter and prescription, have been derived from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6729977/A-diet-rich-grains-slashes-risk-liver-cancer-40-study-finds.html"&gt;natural sources&lt;/a&gt;. Bark of willow trees has been called nature's aspirin. The antibiotic penicillin comes from a mold called Penicillium. And metformin, a common &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e7e24b20-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; medication, was initially derived from the French Lilac plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings provide scientists worldwide with an easy-to-produce and inexpensive method for creating large quantities of the guava's naturally occurring cancer-fighting molecules in the laboratory. It also opens the door to more effective and accessible liver cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using common chemicals, scientists can now produce potent cancer-fighting molecules originally found in guava plants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer deaths among women plummeted through much of the 20th century, but have steadily ticked up to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In men, deaths have remained high since then, reaching 10.1 deaths per 100,000 people with the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally occurring molecule that the University of Delaware chemists synthesized is called (-)-psiguadial A, which has demonstrated a potent ability to stop the growth and division of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists, led by Dr Chain, started by building a key - and complex - component of the cancer-fighting molecule found in the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating the correct 3D shape of the component was crucial because the molecule only works if its shape is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once created, they attached it to another key part of the molecule. This was a major hurdle in the research because the specific spots they had to connect were buried and crowded by other atoms, making it difficult to form a new bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the researchers used a chemical to cause a reaction that made the molecule curl around and connect to itself, forming a special ring-shaped structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ring is the unique, central part of the natural medicine that gives it its power to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A large number of our medicines, including everyday pills and powerful prescriptions, were first discovered in natural sources including fruits (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said that while they have achieved a crucial first step by creating this molecule in the lab, this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanism that allows (-)-psiguadial A to kill cancer cells is still under investigation and the researchers still do not fully understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used measurements of (-)-psiguadial A potency taken from experiments on human liver cancer cells grown in petri dishes. Previous studies on the compound have also used animal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extracts containing these compounds were tested in samples in lab petri dishes against a broad panel of nine other human cancer lines, including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the compound itself has not yet been tested in human patients, though the successful synthesis is the first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still years away from human use, their breakthrough paves the way for developing a potential new class of targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ultimate goal is to create a treatment that is more precise and has fewer harsh side effects than traditional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam O'Grady, doctoral student in Chain's lab and the article's first author, said: ‘We are the first ones to pave that road, and other people can repave it any which way.

This Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, scientifically known as Semaglutide, was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Today, it’s better known for delivering rapid, dramatic weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ozempic’s meteoric rise has brought increased scrutiny. Its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, now faces a flood of lawsuits. Patients are alleging a wide range of side effects, from digestive issues to the more alarming claim of irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ozempic remains a focal point of ongoing medical research and cultural conversation, these lawsuits have placed the drug at the heart of a high-stakes legal battle. Here’s what you need to know about the controversy that’s reshaping public perception and corporate accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside the Newest Wave of Ozempic Lawsuit Filings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg" alt="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." title="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/self-injection-with-semaglutide-for-obesity-royalty-free-image/2189925153?phrase=ozempic&amp;amp;adppopup=true" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tatsiana Volkava / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk is facing a rapidly escalating legal crisis, with thousands of individual lawsuits filed just this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mass tort litigation, similar lawsuits are often consolidated into a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) to streamline the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/ozempic-gastroparesis-lawsuit.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lawsuit Information Centre&lt;/a&gt; reports that MDL 3094 was created in February 2024 by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to handle the growing number of Ozempic-related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This MDL also includes other semaglutide drugs like Wegovy and Rybelsus, along with Mounjaro, a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of its creation, the MDL contained just 55 cases. By August 2024, that figure jumped to 346. As of August 2025, there are 2,190 active cases, with plaintiffs claiming Novo Nordisk failed to adequately warn them about severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vision Loss Is the Flashpoint in the Ozempic Lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/legal/ozempic-lawsuit/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drug Watch&lt;/a&gt; reports that most Ozempic lawsuits initially centered around gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, and cyclical vomiting syndrome. But over time, a growing number of users of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus began reporting a rare eye condition called Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July 2024 study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; found a link between Ozempic use and NAION. Novo Nordisk has argued that many of the diabetic patients involved already faced a heightened risk of vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in February 2025, a follow-up cohort study in the same journal showed a clearer increase in NAION risk among semaglutide users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, twenty-one NAION plaintiffs moved to consolidate their cases in New Jersey state court. This was notable not only because of the severity of the vision claims, but also because Novo Nordisk’s U.S. headquarters is located in Plainsboro, New Jersey. Plaintiffs aimed to challenge the company directly on its home turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus from stomach issues to vision loss has changed the tone of the lawsuits entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gastrointestinal side effects can be managed over time, they rarely result in lasting disability (per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15522-gastroparesis" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;). NAION, on the other hand, can lead to sudden, irreversible optic nerve damage and permanent vision loss, as reported by the &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs suffering from vision loss often face total blindness or an inability to live independently. This makes their stories far more powerful to juries and increases the chances of large verdicts or punitive settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a product liability case is now a broader question of public health and corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Patients Are Saying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg" alt="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." title="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1e5gj8k/help_im_confused_about_the_ozempic_pen_i_have/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the clinical terms and legal jargon, it’s the personal stories that are shaping the Ozempic lawsuits. Some complaints include harrowing details of vision loss that paint a picture of suffering, corporate failure, and Big Pharma profit over patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such story comes from James Norris, a mechanic in his late fifties who was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawsuit-alleges-man-diabetes-became-blind-taking-ozempic-rcna202959" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Norris was later diagnosed with NAION after his dosage was increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old retail worker from North Carolina. She went legally blind after using Ozempic for her diabetes. In a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; interview, she said, “I no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can’t have any sort of independence…All of my hopes and dreams have been dashed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are a stark contrast to the glowing celebrity endorsements and social media hype that promoted Ozempic as a miracle weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNnxUpiuZVs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits have sparked widespread discussion on forums. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1fkmk9l/had_to_stop_ozempic_due_to_eye_issues/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; user said they had to stop using Ozempic due to temporary vision loss. Another shared that their vision became blurry for weeks after a dosage increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are now key in the broader legal and public debate, giving a human face to claims that might otherwise be buried in data and court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is There a Link Between Ozempic and Irreversible Vision Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;While Ozempic has been linked to vision loss through multiple studies and regulatory reviews, a direct causal relationship remains unproven. Research shows an elevated risk of developing Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) among users, but it’s still unclear whether the drug itself causes the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone, which promotes feelings of fullness and triggers insulin release to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/can-ozempic-affect-eye-health-here-s-what-ophthalm" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt; explains that Ozempic may lead to sharp changes in blood sugar, which can alter the shape of the eye’s lens and cause temporary vision issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that semaglutide reduces blood flow to the optic nerve, possibly triggering NAION and resulting in permanent vision damage. This condition is often called a “stroke of the optic nerve” (via &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eye Physicians of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters is the fact that diabetic patients are already at risk for NAION and other eye issues, making it challenging to isolate Ozempic as the direct cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2024 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; study found that diabetic patients on semaglutide were over four times more likely to develop NAION than those on alternative treatments. The risk was even greater among overweight users, a key demographic for Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg" alt="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." title="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-anonymous-woman-on-the-scales-before-her-weight-loss-news-photo/141598984?adppopup=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tina Stallard / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors emphasized that the data showed correlation, not causation, their work supported early plaintiff claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study in 2025 echoed these findings, noting an uptick in vision-related complications among Ozempic users, even those without prior eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; officially listed NAION as a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide. According to the agency, it may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users after a year on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a regulatory body confirms what plaintiffs are alleging, it significantly strengthens their case. The EMA also urged patients to seek medical attention immediately if they notice sudden vision changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts caution that more research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. However, with growing evidence and regulatory acknowledgment, there is already considerable support for the ongoing mass tort litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Legal Battle Is Evolving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most Ozempic-related cases fall under &lt;a href="https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl/mdl-3094-re-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-glp-1-ras-products-liability-litigation" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDL 3094&lt;/a&gt;, a multidistrict litigation focused on GLP-1 agonists. The core allegation is that Novo Nordisk failed to warn doctors and patients about the drug’s severe risks, including permanent vision loss and stomach paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Novo Nordisk is expected to invoke long-standing legal doctrines that often shield pharmaceutical companies. One is the “learned intermediary doctrine,” which holds that the company’s duty is fulfilled once it warns the prescribing physician. The burden then shifts to the doctor to relay those risks to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another likely defense is preemption. The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute&lt;/a&gt; explains this as the idea that federal law, like the FDA’s approval process, can override state-level failure-to-warn claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law firms like Morgan &amp;amp; Morgan, Motley Rice, and Seeger Weiss are leading the charge for plaintiffs. Each firm has a seat on the Plaintiffs’ Leadership Committee and is responsible for proving injury and showing Novo Nordisk knowingly withheld crucial safety information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the MDL, some of the most serious NAION cases have been filed in &lt;a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/notice-multicounty-litigation-application-new-jersey-state-court-litigation-alleging-use-of" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New Jersey state court&lt;/a&gt;, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered. This legal strategy could invoke state consumer protection laws and create a more favorable path for plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to a long, high-stakes legal showdown that could reshape pharmaceutical accountability rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk faces more than mounting legal fees. Its reputation and financial future may be on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early projections from &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; estimate that total payouts from the Ozempic lawsuits could exceed $2 billion. This figure factors in the severity of the injuries, long-term medical costs, lost income, and damages for pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of permanent vision loss into the litigation significantly raises the stakes. These NAION cases are now expected to serve as “bellwether” trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://clp.law.stanford.edu/bellwether-trials/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stanford University &lt;/a&gt;explains, bellwether trials are early cases used to gauge how juries might respond to evidence and arguments. A single major verdict favoring a NAION plaintiff could sharply increase Novo Nordisk’s overall liability and shape the size of future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the outcome of these early NAION cases could determine the trajectory of the entire litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pharmaceutical Industry Is Responding to Mounting Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing billions in potential liability, Novo Nordisk is rolling out a multifaceted strategy to defend itself. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing, maintaining that its GLP-1 drugs are safe when used as prescribed and already carry adequate warnings for known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk has also launched a quiet media push. &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; reports the company is emphasizing that the off-label weight loss boom was driven by social media, exposing users to risks not accounted for in the drug’s intended use. In other words, many injuries may stem from misuse, not manufacturer failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/principles-positions-and-policies/illicit-compounding-position.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt; is cracking down on compounding pharmacies and telehealth clinics that sell unauthorized versions of its medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-files-14-lawsuits-unapproved-semaglutide-drugs/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the company has filed over 132 lawsuits across 40 states and secured at least 44 permanent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These legal moves serve two goals: tackling a public health risk and casting the company as a defender of drug safety. Novo Nordisk has also ramped public education efforts to warn against unsafe compounded products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these actions suggest the company may argue that any harm plaintiffs suffered came not from its FDA-approved drugs, but from unregulated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Broader Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Ozempic’s transformation from a niche diabetes treatment to a cultural phenomenon has sparked wider debates about beauty standards, off-label drug use, and pharmaceutical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg" alt="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." title="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/yeythw/f3952_195155140_lbs_cico_and_ozempic_no_exercise/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/progresspics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s popularity exploded as influencers and celebrities flooded social media with dramatic before-and-after shots, often touting effortless weight loss without the need for exercise or diet changes. &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/celebrities-before-and-after-ozempic/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Celebrity transformations&lt;/a&gt; helped feed the frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This viral demand extended far beyond Ozempic’s approved use, exposing a wider and more diverse population to potential side effects and setting the stage for today’s lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of Ozempic also fits into a larger shift around injectables and cosmetic trends, including procedures like the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lip-flip-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;lip flip&lt;/a&gt; and transformations seen in figures like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/kimberly-guilfoyle-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Kimberly Guilfoyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, weight loss isn’t just aesthetic.

The case was tied to a 4-year-old suburban Cook resident, who is not vaccinated, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child is believed to acquired measles during international travel. CCDPH is working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed, in collaboration with Illinois Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of public exposure occurred Thursday, Sept. 11, in Terminal 5 at O’Hare International Airport, between the hours of 7:30 to 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--mobile__18tT_"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For People Who May Have Been Exposed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who may have been exposed should check with their health care provider if they are unsure about prior vaccination. The health care provider will determine the need for testing if symptoms develop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call a healthcare provider before going to a medical office or emergency department for evaluation to ensure that special arrangement can be made to prevent patients and medical staff from possible exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People that are unvaccinated against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;mumps and rubella (MMR)&lt;/a&gt; and are exposed should talk with their doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps or rubella and doing so may prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people are vaccinated against measles routinely in childhood and are not at high risk. The best defense against measles is vaccination. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles and generally provide lifelong immunity. The first dose should be given between 12-15 months of age; the second between the ages of 4-6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or are unvaccinated will also become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__oN6vv"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can linger in a room for up to two hours and can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kiran Joshi, chief operating officer for the CCDPH, said the case is a critical reminder for residents traveling to areas with active measles transmission to follow &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Ftravel%2Findex.html/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/N3CBU6yA0gJQtMWCto4R5LPrsWbyP-pX2Pul86S-PIM=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated with the MMR vaccine at least two weeks prior to travel. Children between the age of 6-11 months should get an early dose of the vaccine if they are planning on international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses we know, and it’s entirely preventable. This case is a serious reminder that vaccination is not just about individual protection, it’s a critical community responsibility,” Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Simbo Ige said in a news release. “We strongly encourage all Chicagoans, especially families traveling internationally and those working in high-exposure settings, like airports, to review their vaccination records and get up to date. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cook County Department of Public Health offers free MMR vaccines to anyone who needs them.

The rash usually begins on the face and spreads to the trunk. A person is generally contagious the four days before and four days after the onset of a rash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to Get Vaccinated&lt;/strong&gt;- To make an appointment for measles vaccination at a Cook County Health community health center in Chicago or suburban Cook County call 833-308-1988.&lt;br&gt;Unvaccinated individuals who do not have a healthcare provider are encouraged to contact &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fcookcountyhealth.org%2F/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/CCoJDEXA6a02ZXyVYlIzWAv0qHGn2cgpj5VL7zNBuPk=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cook County Health&lt;/a&gt; at 312-864-1111 to schedule a vaccination appointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/publichealth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free MMR vaccinations for anyone who needs them, regardless of insurance status, at CDPH immunization clinics throughout the city. Walk-ins are welcome, but registration is highly encouraged. Create an account and register for an appointment at &lt;a href="http://getvaxchi.chicago.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GetVaxChicago&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Vaccination History&lt;/strong&gt; – The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine for lifelong protection. If unsure, you can check your vaccine history.

Vitamin A supplementation does not prevent measles infection. It can help reduce the severity of measles symptoms—particularly in malnourished children or those with vitamin A deficiency—but only after infection has occurred. According to the CDC, vitamin A may be used as part of supportive care for measles in some patients, under medical supervision. However, relying on vitamin A instead of vaccination puts individuals and communities at risk of infection, complications, and disease spread&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are frequently around international travelers, such as individuals who work at airports or taxi and rideshare drivers, should also be sure to double-check their vaccination status, as their risk of exposure to measles is heightened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/illinois/oaklawn/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:16:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在预算紧张的情况下，长滩卫生局终止了计划，裁员-长滩邮报</title><link>https://lbpost.com/news/health/amid-budget-crunch-long-beach-health-department-ends-programs-cuts-jobs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p&gt;The Long Beach Health Department is planning to lay off or reassign up to 40 people in a retraction caused by the end of some programs and swift federal cuts announced earlier this year. The department currently employs about 500 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of this week, five people have been laid off, while one resigned and another accepted a part-time position. Fifteen people are pending reassignment, while nine more have been placed elsewhere in the city — mostly somewhere else in the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine positions are on the bubble and could be retained if grant or city funding is secured, according to a Health Department spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the affected jobs are tied to federal funding, and involve health education, HIV-prevention and racial equity programs. Others were a part of temporary programs scheduled to conclude between now and the end of the year. They said announcements about which programs are ending will come later this year.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The looming cuts were announced during a &lt;a href="https://longbeachca.new.swagit.com/videos/353131"&gt;budget presentation&lt;/a&gt; by Health Director Alison King, who informed the City Council that the department has seen nearly $4 million clawed back by the federal government since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;King warned the reductions will stymie the department’s ability to test and prevent the spread of infection, including HIV and AIDS, as well as childhood immunizations and how swiftly it may respond to public health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How impactful this will be remains unclear, said Health Department Deputy Director Erica Valencia-Adachi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as the department faced up to an $11 million deficit this year, fueled by rising labor costs, inconsistent state funding and expensive citywide emergencies for homelessness and disease outbreaks. The department also faces a 28% vacancy rate, King added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Beyond legislative pressures, our health fund faces persisting, compounding cost drivers that strain every program,” King said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The department has also struggled to cover a ballooning cost in administrative overhead on some grant-funded projects — about 50% of which officials say cannot be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are charges that come indirectly with the rollout of a grant program, and can span anything from the cost of electricity and plumbing at a facility, equipment needed to be purchased and the hourly costs of having city accountants file required paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say any staffers losing their jobs will be helped with courtesy review of resumes, interview coaching and internal transfers where possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: This story was updated to show a spokesperson says the Health Department has about 500 employees, not 300 as stated on the department’s website, and to show there were multiple temporary programs concluding, not just one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last year, in a stroke of luck, researchers from the University of Copenhagen stumbled upon them once more, and found a suspect white powder lurking within. This residue, they would go on to uncover, contained bacteria from the 1890s and had once-upon-a-time been used to make butter, thus opening up a window into the Scandinavian country’s dairy-making past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only gate-screenreader--text"&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was like opening a kind of microbiological relic. The fact that we were able to extract genetic information from bacteria used in Danish butter production 130 years ago was far more than we had dared to hope for,” Jørgen Leisner, author of a recent study presenting the findings, said in a &lt;a href="https://food.ku.dk/english/news/2025/stored-for-130-years-bottles-reveal-evidence-of-danish-butter-production-and-hygiene-practices-of-the-past/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a peek at the bottles’ labels, Leisner and co-authors saw that they contained cultures of lactic acid bacteria – microbes that have long been used in food preservation and flavoring. To investigate further, they extracted and sequenced DNA from the samples, comparing it with databases of known bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they discovered traces of the lactic acid bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactococcus cremoris&lt;/em&gt;, which is still used today by Danish dairies to acidify milk and kill harmful bacteria after &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-are-once-again-claiming-raw-milk-is-good-for-you-heres-why-its-not-73159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pasteurization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as this, the researchers identified genes in&lt;em&gt; L. cremoris&lt;/em&gt; associated with dairy adaptation, including those that contribute to buttery flavors – something the team says is interesting given the “mild flavor profile preferred in Danish butter for the English market during the 19th century”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the 1800s, Denmark began shipping butter to England on a large scale. To ensure good hygiene in its products, milk was first pasteurized before adding bacteria – called &lt;a href="https://dairyprocessinghandbook.tetrapak.com/chapter/cultures-and-starter-manufacture" target="_blank"&gt;starter cultures&lt;/a&gt; – which ferment and convey properties of acidity, flavor, aroma, and texture while also having a preservative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The starter culture became the key to standardized butter production. It was no longer possible for each dairy to ferment in its own way – it was necessary to ensure that the products tasted the same, regardless of where in the country the butter was made. The starter culture made the taste reproducible,” Leisner added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found evidence of other, less savory, bacteria in the bottles: they were contaminated with &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acnes&lt;/em&gt; – a skin bacterium that causes acne – and potentially pathogenic bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/stowaway-rat-that-hopped-on-a-flight-from-miami-was-a-wake-up-call-for-global-health-80794" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vibrio furnissii&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, the dairy industry faced some steep production challenges in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the contents of the bottles testify to the standardization of a dairy product that every farming family used to make themselves in a jar of sour milk kept close to the stove. But it also shows that hygiene conditions were still different from those we have today," co-author Nathalia Brichet explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about some &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-worlds-oldest-cheese-has-been-found-rubbed-on-a-bunch-of-mummies-76096" target="_blank"&gt;ancient cheese&lt;/a&gt; to go with your bygone butter?

Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah on Tuesday, accompanied by a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report, produced in collaboration with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, found 70% of Utah’s maternal deaths could have been prevented. Maternal health refers to a woman’s health during pregnancy and for a period of time postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The top three causes of poor outcomes are mental health conditions, substance use disorders and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found many factors, however, that combine to contribute to those poor maternal health outcomes, including both physical and mental health — which has worsened considerably in the last decade — substance use, intimate partner violence, lack of access to maternal health care and social determinants of health like poverty, food insecurity and transportation challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report said — and the panel agreed — that the share of women experiencing each risk factor for poor maternal health outcomes depends on individual situations, including how far they are from maternal health care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In some cases, care is far away in Utah, including five counties where women must travel an hour or more to the nearest birthing hospital. And many women who are far from care are not in a financial position to take time off to travel to doctor appointments that are more readily accessible in urban areas, according to panelist Danielle Pendergrass, a nurse consultant with Eastern Utah Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She listed income and geographic location as the two major barriers to receiving adequate prenatal and other maternity care for those in rural Utah. “It’s a great day when I only had to take a half-day off work to get to my appointment,” Pendergrass said she has been told by women making low wages in her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report also noted that the share of Utah women of reproductive age with physical or mental health challenges has been rising, putting more women at risk of complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Even so, Utah fares better than the national average, with 16 cases of maternal mortality per 100,000 live births, compared to 23 per 100,000 nationally. When it comes to severe outcomes short of death, Utah averages 61 per 10,000 compared to 88 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the Utah birth certificate database in the Office of Vital Records and Statistics, there were nearly 45,000 live births in Utah in 2023, with almost 6 in 10 of the mothers residing in Salt Lake or Utah counties. Of those, just under 83% were delivered by a physician, 13% by a certified nurse midwife, not quite 4% by other midwives and 0.3% by “other.” More than 95% of those births took place in a hospital. But the report notes that seven Utah counties do not even have a birthing hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Where-are-the-risk-factors" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Where are the risk factors?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found that “rates of pre-pregnancy risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are higher in Utah’s rural counties. Over 19% of 2023 Utah births occurred in counties with a high prevalence of pre-pregnancy physical health risk factors. Sexually transmitted infections are another pre-pregnancy risk factor, with rates highest among Wasatch Front counties and San Juan County.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Poor physical health is a greater issue among Utah women in racial and ethnic minority populations and also for those with household incomes below the federal poverty line, per the report. The highest prevalence is in Piute (30.1%), Wayne (24.3%), Carbon (23.5%), Sevier (22.9%) and Emery (22.6%) counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah, the rate of poor mental health rose 18.7 percentage points in 10 years, increasing the risk of pregnancy complications. And mental health challenges are more common among Utah women than the national average. Close to 4 in 10 Utah women of childbearing age have been diagnosed with depression and 1 in 6 experience symptoms of postpartum depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Data show that only 55% of Utah women with symptoms of anxiety or depression before, during or after pregnancy report asking for help from a health care provider,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More than 43% of women ages 18-44 — the range considered of reproductive age — living below poverty experience poor mental health, compared to 34.4% living above that federal poverty line, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Substance use not only negatively impacts outcomes for both mother and baby, but also decreases the likelihood a pregnant woman will seek prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So does lack of health insurance, which is more likely among women in racial and ethnic minority populations than among white women. Lack of insurance is also more likely in rural counties of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As for intimate partner violence, during pregnancy it is linked to maternal depression, anxiety, PTSD and greater risk of maternal death. It also increases the likelihood of giving birth prematurely, low birth weight and fetal injury, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“But the bigger barrier is cultural,” said Kasey Shakespear, executive director of the Rural Health Association of Utah. “We (in rural communities) don’t like to ask for help. We don’t like to bother people,” he said, noting rural residents put themselves last. As for mental health, he said people are even less likely to seek care for fear of being judged harshly. It’s not just access, he said. “You don’t want people to know you struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sarah Woolsey, medical director of the Association of Utah Community Health, called telemedicine a bright spot in providing maternal health care to women who are far away from routine appointments. But she noted that the workforce also needs to be bolstered. So does the social support network. “Women do best when they have a support system,” she said, and that can be built within a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-struggling-workforce" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A struggling workforce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Melanie Beagley, Gardner Institute senior health research analyst, said four Utah counties lack a family physician, 13 have no OB/GYN and 12 have no certified nurse midwife right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Add all those workforce shortages in maternal health — 22 of Utah’s 29 counties are deemed primary care workforce shortage areas although 77% of the mothers giving birth in 2023 resided in them — to the other care barriers and a good maternal health outcome is not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers found that more than a quarter of those who die in pregnancy or postpartum (28.7%) have at least one barrier to accessing care, including not enough money (23%) and access to transportation (14.9%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the report found no category of professional providing an aspect of maternal care that is in surplus, from physicians assistants to nurse practitioners specializing in maternal health care to doulas and community health workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report cites projections that Utah’s workforce will not be able to meet the coming needs for maternal health provision across multiple specialties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s projected that by 2036 there will be enough certified nurse midwives in Utah, but the Beehive State will have just 72% of its needed family practice doctors and 57% of needed OB/GYNs. In 2025, Utah has enough OB/GYNs to meet about 69% of the demand.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And those specialists won’t necessarily be located in areas that promise adequate access. Without change, unmet maternal health needs are very likely to continue, Beagley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most rural counties will probably still have provider shortages, the report said, including in the number of midwives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Shakespear said that Wayne County, for instance, currently has none of those provider types. The health care workforce shortage in some communities goes well beyond maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Family physicians, who can manage uncomplicated pregnancies and a critical part of caring for people with mental health issues and chronic conditions, are predicted to be in inadequate supply as well, especially in rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s all an issue that Ashley Moretz, deputy division director in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said state officials, including the governor, are taking very seriously. He said his department has been very active in trying to plug holes in maternal health care, working with partners including funding sources like the Utah Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said one silver lining in the challenge is Utah’s culture of working together to find solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Data was collected at the county level from many sources, including from groups like the American Medical Association, March of Dimes, hospital websites and more. The Gardner Institute also interviewed maternal health stakeholders to gain insights, including both barriers and challenges, as well as efforts to improve maternal health outcomes in Utah. Those efforts cover a range, from improving mental and physical health care to improving access to substance use treatment. Stories were also gathered about family challenges accessing care, with a focus on population groups that face significant barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVTJXTGtDSGUxLXJGVjA3R0RGTTE2anZWaUJXYlJUUDNwNmpLakZXSDlBMjdtSEVGcVg5SldtMXFtOEVUWmFJQTN3MnFYQl9aT3Z6TzF3M0lka2lQZVVVdldqYVRETEpRUDRJSkExMmxiVTVvNlFnQWJ4dXRaUzluZXcyTWZHX19DcVdMdVB3R0VsNGFvSkRuc2ZTbEw4TzEzNkhGNTB2VjJ4Z05ZUjVYTk5NTkdZU09Sd3lF</guid></item><item><title>贝利在心脏病发作后的恢复中大放异彩： “对我来说最糟糕的部分是节食，试图减轻体重” - BLABBERMOUTH.NET</title><link>https://blabbermouth.net/news/blaze-bayley-on-his-post-heart-attack-recovery-the-worst-part-about-it-for-me-is-the-diet-trying-to-keep-the-weight-off</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="news-content margin__top-xlarge margin__bottom-xlarge"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview with &lt;b&gt;Jorge Botas&lt;/b&gt; of Portugal's &lt;a href="https://metalglobal.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Metal Global&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; singer &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt; once again opened up about his health — two and a half years after undergoing a quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack in March 2023. The 62-year-old singer — who fronted &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; more than two and a half decades ago — said (as transcribed by &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;): "Yeah. I'm so lucky, really. With heart disease, it's one of those things, it creeps up on you. You just feel a bit out of breath here, and things are a bit more of a struggle there, and you don't really start thinking too much about it, but it adds up over time and suddenly you're having a heart attack. It's, like, how did this happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "The main thing, at the hospital, I'd just got in. They put you in this amazing room where they can X-ray you and look at all these things while other people are in the room and everything, and look at all. And they're looking at it and go, 'No, it's not stents. It's gonna need surgery. No, we can't do anything for you here. Put you out on the ward. You wait for the surgeon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a quadruple bypass, and I've made a good recovery," he continued. "I had a little hiccup in my recovery because when I got well enough to exercise and it was safe to exercise, I had a knee injury, and that put me back about five months, really. But, yeah, apart from that, I've got my strength back now, and I've made a good recovery. They discovered that I did have an abnormal heart in that the left side was smaller and somehow it wasn't working the best. And so the right side had been taking up the strain. And they said, with the new plumbing, I might feel an advantage. And I do — compared to what I was before, I've got a lot more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worst part about it for me is the diet — trying to keep the weight off," &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; admitted. "I managed to lose a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of weight with changing my habits and no exercise &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. I managed to lose 30 pounds with no exercise, just by eating sensible and the way that I should have been eating. Bad habits creep back, so I'm having to try again with that. But that's about it. I stopped drinking a while ago, and it was difficult in the beginning, but gradually it's less and less of a challenge over the years, and it was all right. And the diet, to try and stay healthy, it's much tougher to give up chocolate, sugar, biscuits, donuts, sausage rolls, pies — it's much tougher to give up that than to give up booze. I wasn't a raging alcoholic, but with my mental health, I'm, like, 'I've gotta stop drinking because I've drank enough. I'm old enough now. I don't really need another drink.' But then to stop eating pies and all these things — and I start feeling, 'Oh, I feel great now. My knees feel better. Everything feels better now. I've lost all this weight.' And then bit by bit, 'Oh, I'll just have that little treat.' And then, 'My God. I look just like I'm gonna have a heart attack. No!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the worst thing — it's the diet, man. It's tough. And the food industry and Big Pharma [large, multinational pharmaceutical companies] are absolutely complicit in making us fat and giving us heart disease and strokes. Absolutely. They can sue me. Because it's absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The healthiest time in the U.K. was in World War II when people had to have rations, so there wasn't much food," &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; added. "[People] were [at their] healthiest — less heart attack, strokes, less illness, less obesity, less everything. And then when we had — and this is the worst thing — they say, 'Oh, the best thing since sliced bread,' is an expression. Sliced bread is the worst thing. Bread made in a factory is one of the absolute worst things for our health, and they told us, 'Oh, it's the best thing?' No, it's the worst thing. Bread should be made by bakers early in the morning, not in a factory. Anyway, that's me. I had a heart attack and I feel it's partly their fault. I didn't know white bread was poisonous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; fronted &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; from 1994 until 1999. The two &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; albums he appeared on, &lt;b&gt;"The X Factor"&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;"Virtual XI"&lt;/b&gt;, sold considerably less than the band's prior releases and were their lowest-charting titles in the group's home country since 1981's &lt;b&gt;"Killers"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; in 1999, &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; has released a number of albums, including several under the moniker &lt;b&gt;BLAZE&lt;/b&gt; and more than a handful under his own name. He also appeared on 2012's &lt;b&gt;"Wolfsbane Saves The World"&lt;/b&gt;, the first album of new material by &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt; since the group's self-titled 1994 effort, and a follow-up LP, 2022's &lt;b&gt;"Genius"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt;'s latest studio album, &lt;b&gt;"Circle Of Stone"&lt;/b&gt;, came out in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; told &lt;a href="https://www.themetalvoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Metal Voice&lt;/a&gt; about his heart attack: "There's so many lucky things about a terrible incident in my life. I'm at home on Saturday. On the Friday, I've just signed off on what I think is probably the final mastered mix of a new album. That's on a Friday. Here I am on a Saturday. On the Monday, I'm scheduled to go on tour in Europe to continue with &lt;b&gt;'The Man Who Would Not Die'&lt;/b&gt; tour. And there I am, and I've got chest pains, and I think, 'Oh, is this indigestion?' I'm having a heart attack. I live two minutes from the ambulance station. I'm on the phone, and apparently the paramedics, they were going on their break towards the ambulance station and they said, 'Oh, we heard that call. It's on our way. We'll take that call.' Two minutes, they're in my house. I've got wires on my chest. 'You're having a heart attack.' I live in the city, but I'm between four hospitals. In 15 minutes I'm having treatment, and they're injecting me with dye to see what the problems are and everything. So that's it. I'm safe. I'm in hospital 15 minutes later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "They said, the paramedics, if that had been 10 minutes [later], there's no way you'd make it. So I was 10 minutes from death. I had a heart attack, not heart failure. They got to me in time. But if I'd have been somewhere else, if I'd have been in Eurotunnel, if I'd have been in a hotel room alone, or on the autobahn in Germany — anywhere, man… It's just terrifying, really, to think about where I could be. And when they said, 'Oh, you should be able to make it back,' I said, 'I've gotta get back to work. I can't leave it like this.' I've done an album called &lt;b&gt;'War Within Me'&lt;/b&gt;, and I haven't toured the whole thing. I'm thinking of my fans and everything. I thought, 'I can't leave it like this. I've still got more music to make. I've got things to say, and I don't wanna feel like I'm letting my fans down either.' So I was so focused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; added: "It took a while — like a few weeks — before they could put me in for the surgery. It was a quadruple bypass. Basically, they cut you in half. They cut me in half, they do a load of plumbing and then they put you back together. And the guy said, 'We wired you back together with surgical steel wire.' He said, 'We've doubled wired.' I said, 'So even more metal?' Yeah, even more metal. So I've got more metal in me than a normal heart patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what symptoms he experienced prior to suffering his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "It's different for everyone. And this is why it's so confusing. That's why I didn't know I was having a heart attack. My heart attack was a pain that starts — it's like someone sitting on your chest or being kicked by a horse in your chest in slow motion, and it goes from the front to the back and you're sweating and all of this. That's how it happened for me. That's common. The other thing that happens is, for some people — and I didn't have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of this — you start going numb, you start going tingly down your left arm and it spreads across you. That's another thing. And for other people, there are other symptoms. So you just don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding what steps other men can take toward reducing their chances of having a heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "You've gotta try and head it off early by getting tested for your cholesterol, your triglycerides, and all of this. And just exercise is vital, and we just don't realize that. It's vital. I think chronic laziness is one of the things. You get out the van, you get on the stage, I'm active for a couple of hours, breathing all of that, hadn't been away for a while, hadn't done anything for a while. COVID, two years of not going out there all the time. And I think that a big combination of things, and some bad habits, that led up to something that was almost fatal, really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; shared details of the massive outpouring of well-wishes he received after his heart attack, including messages from his former &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing I feel most lucky about is the incredible support I've had from my fans," he told &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;. "All over the world. My &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fans. Everybody bought a t-shirt for a tour that was postponed. They still bought it to support me. I'm just incredibly lucky. And the letters people wrote to me. Hundreds of cards from all over the place. It's very humbling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "I've always put my whole life into music. It is my life. When people get in touch with you and say, 'I wish you well because your music has gotten me through tough times,' 'Your music meant this to me,' 'I first saw you way back when and it's been the soundtrack to my life,' it's incredible. I got a massive card from the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fan club. The [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt;] guys all sent me a message. I'm always in touch with &lt;b&gt;Steve Harris&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bassist] anyway, but everyone sent messages of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, is used to improve blood flow to the heart. A surgeon uses blood vessels taken from another area of the body to bypass the damaged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term quadruple bypass refers to the number of coronary arteries bypassed in the procedure. In other words, a quadruple bypass means four coronary arteries are bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oppa3umPUY?si=Vo6xbKgxndniiskb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BLABBERMOUTH.NET</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:36:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxObE9tbk44OUFVX0pvQ3VOWVQtcEFQUXoyRXhSRWlSU1pYanRCdXdXWVdnTnlZdEh5OXI1VlMzWG9UR1dFYjJxUVV0azIwcW1VVnhQU2p6ZnoxelRGZ3dxeE9SRmM5STNzSFB1SzE1Z2pCaWVXZzh4dk1PaTdRTmlKeUdnNGpyU19DQmoydS0xRXlRUW9uOFZoeU9MRU1Lb2pDdDREUnZsVGdLZ3pfV1VNTVdabXRYMmhXTFpPQWRiZy0xX190T2hMTGUybHN2eVpmSDNiWjYzMURMUHpqd3hrNGNpWQ</guid></item><item><title>催产素促进互惠和同理心-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/oxytocin-reciprocity-empathy-29692/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers developed a fully automated cooperation task showing that rats engage in true reciprocity, not just mutual benefit. Social interaction enhanced success, while dampened interaction reduced cooperative performance. The experience of reciprocity also increased empathy, as rats displayed stronger emotional responses to partners’ distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, oxytocin release in the orbitofrontal cortex underpinned both fair cooperation and empathy, pointing to an internal biological mechanism that prevents free-riding and stabilizes cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocity Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats learned to reciprocate in a structured “pay-first, reward-later” task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin in the orbitofrontal cortex drove cooperation and empathy, reducing free-riding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats with reciprocity experience showed stronger emotional contagion toward their partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Science China Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation in nature can yield immediate mutual benefits or depend on delayed reciprocity. The latter is vulnerable to “free-riding,” where a beneficiary fails to return help, and classical theories emphasize external enforcement (e.g., second- and third-party punishment). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such mechanisms are limited in real-world animal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Science Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Zuoren Wang (CEBSIT, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Yulong Li (Peking University) present a fully automated reciprocal cooperation task in rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two rats, placed in adjacent chambers, must poke their respective ports within a 1-second window to complete a cooperative trial; only one receives water, and the beneficiary alternates randomly across trials—creating a “pay-first, reward-later” structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With training, rats showed robust direct reciprocity rather than mere mutualism, and richer social interaction predicted faster, more successful cooperation; adding a transparent barrier that dampened interaction reduced reciprocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then asked whether reciprocity experience shapes empathy, assessed via an observational fear paradigm. Compared with individually trained controls, reciprocity-trained rats displayed higher emotional contagion toward their partners whether co-housed or separately housed—while demonstrators’ shock responses, observers’ social attention, and 22-kHz calls did not differ between groups, arguing for a specific effect of reciprocity experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe mechanism, the authors combined GRAB-OXT1.0 with fiber photometry recording and found markedly higher oxytocin release in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during reciprocity than during mutualism or individual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, oxytocin-deficient (OXT-KO) rats free-ride more often, were less likely to reciprocate after betrayal, and failed to show the empathy increase seen in wild-type animals—implicating oxytocin-mediated empathy as a key internal brake on free-riding that stabilizes cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings position OFC oxytocin signaling and empathy as an intrinsic motivational pathway complementing external enforcement models of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Project (2022ZD0205100); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB32010300); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX05)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this oxytocin and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d544c434f48446d5e4e444e4544434c034e4240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bei Yan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scichina.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science China Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bei Yan – Science China Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2025.08.042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxytocin-mediated empathy internally facilitates cooperative behaviors in rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Zuoren Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin-mediated empathy internally facilitates cooperative behaviors in rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity is considered one of the vital mechanisms that sustain the evolution of cooperative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, free-riding, where assistance is received but not reciprocated, poses a serious threat to reciprocity behavior, which relies on future payback. Previous theories proposed that third-party punishment plays a vital role in preventing free-riding behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this external mechanism has inherent limitations, particularly in situations where third parties are absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy, the ability to perceive and share the emotional states of others, has long been considered a driving force behind prosocial behavior, yet its role in cooperative behavior remains underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we have designed a new reciprocity paradigm, and demonstrate that rats’ reciprocity behavior can stably establish even in the absence of the external mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, reciprocity experiences can enhance the empathy of wild type rats, but not oxytocin-deficient rats, towards their partners. Furthermore, oxytocin-deficient rats exhibit more free-riding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through fiber photometry recording of oxytocin probe, we found that oxytocin is remarkably released in the orbitofrontal cortex during the reciprocity task, significantly exceeding levels observed in both mutualism and individual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, we suggest that oxytocin-mediated empathy enhancement reduces rats’ free-riding behavior towards their partners, thereby making reciprocity behavior more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This empathy-mediated internal driving force complements the previously proposed external mechanisms, providing new theories and perspectives for understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:51:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFAxbDNMZXg2NDRwdUtOQm5qSXRmQ3ZnS0kyZXg4RGl2X0Y0ekpTdS0xQ0lOZmttNTNxR3JMdTdEVDd0TTFGTEwwa1dsbkM4ZXdLVVVsdUNvSzBKSkJfY1Rsb21lWUtVX0xtYkZDSGZNclJBdw</guid></item><item><title>生活方式的改变显示了预防阿尔茨海默氏症的力量-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/lifestyle-alzheimers-cognition-29690/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A growing body of research underscores that Alzheimer’s and cognitive decline are not inevitable parts of aging. Lifestyle interventions targeting exercise, diet, social engagement, and cognitive stimulation have been shown in large clinical trials to improve brain function and slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These strategies mirror those proven effective in reducing cardiovascular disease and cancer, suggesting wide-reaching health benefits. The findings also highlight a major opportunity for public health initiatives and policies aimed at lowering the long-term burden of dementia on families and health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventable Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Up to 45% of dementia risk is linked to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. POINTER and Finnish FINGER trials both show that structured lifestyle changes improve cognition in at-risk older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Even modest reductions in risk factors could cut national dementia burden by up to 15%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a commentary published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline – potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement – reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes – previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer – also hold transformative potential for brain health,” Hennekens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease.  Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous,” said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline – tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia – amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” said Hennekens. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first and corresponding author is John Dunn, a medical student at the Schmidt College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee89898f82819b9d9aae888f9bc08b8a9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gisele Galoustian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fau.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gisele Galoustian – FAU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2025.08.042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prospects for Clinicians to Reduce Cognitive Decline in Elderly Patients&lt;/a&gt;” by Charles H.

Cognitive decline encompasses decreased executive functions, including memory, thinking, and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians encounter a range of patients who suffer from cognitive decline. These range from mild cognitive impairment to more severe conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or severe dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 7.2 million Americans age 65 years and older suffer from Alzheimer’s disease. By 2060, this figure is estimated to be 13.8 million. These data indicate that, clinicians and public health practitioners face major challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goals of clinicians and public health practitioners are the same which is, namely, to reduce significant cognitive decline as well as mild or moderate declines in their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2022, death rates from cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, declined, but deaths from Alzheimer’s disease increased by over 142%. In addition, it had been estimated in 2020 that perhaps 40 to 45% of the risks of dementia may be attributable to modifiable environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest known and best described risk factor for cognitive decline is chronological age. Loss of cognition among the elderly, however, is not an inevitable consequence of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle risk factors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, obesity, alcohol consumption and medical conditions such as dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, and depression as well as social isolation and intellectual inactivity have been postulated to play important roles in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same therapeutic lifestyle changes of proven benefit in cardiovascular diseases and other common serious diseases, including colorectal cancer, each individually has the potential to decrease cognitive decline in elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, it is tempting to speculate that the presence of multiple risk factors may be additive. Thus, therapeutic lifestyle changes, if demonstrated to be beneficial, would have major clinical and public health implications in reducing cognitive decline in the US and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This possibility is of even greater importance given the interrelationships of cognitive decline with increasing age as well as the increasing proportion of US and other populations of the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:09:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE96di03aGtMeDhfRExWbi1TTENfX1VQTWlEWWFWLVNwNi1yb1dpek5kMmdGTGNCZ2FTejNTMk54dW5Jcm9hcHdUa1BTZGU4VEVmdmJWc0FOY1RlNkluNDNQWDAwTTFNSU9EOTBWQ2tuVF84TEt2</guid></item><item><title>饮食可以改善MS的健康标志物，但不会影响脑部病变-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/09/16/diets-improve-health-markers-ms-dont-affect-brain-lesions-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) who started fasting or adopted a ketogenic diet — one low in carbs and rich in fat — for 18 months showed reductions in risk factors for heart and metabolic disease that were similar to those who followed a standard healthy diet, according to data from a clinical trial conducted in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The results suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, underscoring their potential as a complementary strategy in the treatment of RRMS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sticking to these diets did not show any differences in the number of new brain &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; among patients, which was the trial’s main goal. The diets were tied to a stable disease course, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were trends suggesting the ketogenic diet may support cognition, and fasting may ease symptoms of depression, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-025-01156-5"&gt;Fasting, ketogenic, and anti-inflammatory diets in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial with 18-month follow-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many patients are willing to incorporate dietary strategies into their care, no specific diet has yet been proven to slow disease progression in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, patients are usually advised to follow broad &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy eating guidelines&lt;/a&gt; — consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables, choosing whole grains and lean proteins, and limiting processed or sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting diets, which involve going without eating for several hours each day, and ketogenic diets, which cut down on carbohydrates and increase fat intake, are both believed to have anti-inflammatory effects. These diets have shown promising benefits in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/02/16/review-larger-ms-studies-needed-evaluate-benefit-intermittent-fasting/"&gt;easing symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/03/09/ketogenic-diet-eases-rrms-symptoms-aids-life-quality-rrms-small-study/"&gt;improving quality of life&lt;/a&gt; in people with MS, but the evidence so far comes mainly from small studies and hasn’t been conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MS patients in trial assigned to 1 of 3 diets for 18 months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, a group of researchers from Berlin conducted a clinical trial — enrolling 105 adults with RRMS — that compared a fasting diet against a ketogenic diet and a standard healthy diet with anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03508414"&gt;NAMS trial (NCT03508414)&lt;/a&gt;, conducted at a single site in the country’s capital city, enrolled participants with active RRMS, who could continue to receive a stable dose of their &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 18 months, participants were asked to follow their assigned diet and participate in 10 group sessions designed to encourage adherence, address any questions, and evaluate compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard healthy diet was based on German nutrition guidelines, encouraging mostly vegetarian meals and aiming for a healthy fat balance to help reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fasting diet included a seven-day fast every six months, plus time-restricted eating on six days per week — 14 hours fasting and 10 hours eating. Participants otherwise followed the standard diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet limited carbohydrate intake to 20-40 grams per day while increasing fat consumption to about 70% to 80% of daily calories, mainly from plant-based sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 18 months, none of the diets met the trial’s main goal of reducing the number of new brain lesions, or areas of tissue damage, the data showed. Further, no meaningful differences were seen in lesion volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers noted that the lack of new lesions across all groups after 18 months represented a favorable result, especially because participants had active disease before joining the study. Nearly half of the participants, however, were on stable DMT, which may have helped suppress new disease activity, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Healthy eating lowered patient risk factors for heart, metabolic diseases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the trial failed to meet its main goal, several secondary outcomes showed encouraging effects. For example, people on the fasting diet reported slight improvements in depressive symptoms after 18 months compared with people on the standard diet. Also, cognitive processing speed improved slightly in the fasting group and had a more noticeable increase in the ketogenic group, while remaining unchanged in the standard diet group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though in different ways, all of the diets lowered participants’ risk factors for heart and metabolic diseases. Such risk factors included body weight, body fat, certain blood fats, and blood pressure — all of which have been linked to worse disease outcomes, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormone levels also shifted in a healthier direction, the data showed. Leptin, usually elevated in MS and associated with more severe disability, dropped in the ketogenic group, while adiponectin, which helps protect against inflammation, rose in both the ketogenic and fasting groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No nutrient deficiencies were observed, and all diets were safe and well tolerated, with side effects mostly mild and transient. No serious health events were linked to the interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS,” the researchers wrote. “These results warrant further investigation in larger and more homogeneous study populations to allow for definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, studies confirm that the position in which you sleep also plays a significant role in human health – especially for your stomach and your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body position changes the path of acid in your esophagus, the way your lungs and diaphragm move, and even the balance of your nervous system. Small tweaks can pay off in comfort and in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One body of work that gets right to the point comes from Daniel Martin Simadibrata of the &lt;a href="https://www.ui.ac.id/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team pulled together the best available evidence on sleeping position and reflux symptoms to see what actually helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared left side sleeping with the right side and with lying on your back. They also looked at whether nudging people to stay on their left side at night would reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-digestion-and-sleep-position"&gt;Digestion and sleep position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-gerd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GERD&lt;/a&gt;) flares when stomach acid flows up into the esophagus. Sleeping on your left side, the left lateral decubitus &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-lateral-decubitus-position_fig1_335584367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;position&lt;/a&gt;, keeps the stomach below the esophagus, which makes reflux less likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37969463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found left side sleeping cut acid exposure time by about 2 percentage points compared with the right side and back sleeping, and shortened acid clearance by roughly 75 to 82 seconds. Those changes were linked with better symptom scores at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current evidence suggests that sleeping on the left side could reduce nocturnal reflux and improve GERD-related quality of life,” stated Simadibrata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis also reported no real advantage of laying on the right side over laying on the back for acid exposure or clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left side sleeping does not fix all reflux by itself. It reduces the odds that acid lingers where it should not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wearing-devices-for-treatment"&gt;Wearing devices for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also tested whether a gentle wearable can train position. In a double blind randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35301135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, a small device vibrated to discourage right side sleeping and encouraged time on the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks, treatment success, defined as a 50 percent or greater drop in the nocturnal reflux score, occurred in 44 percent of the device group versus 24 percent of the sham group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device group spent about 61 percent of the night on the left and only 2 percent on the right, and logged more reflux free nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wearables do not add drug side effects. They simply steer you away from positions that make reflux worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-side-sleep-positions-and-gut-health"&gt;Side sleep positions and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the right side, acid can collect near the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach. The meta-analysis showed longer acid exposure and slower clearance compared with the left, which explains the bump in symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;Sleeping&lt;/a&gt; on your back, the supine position, did not beat the right side for reflux measures. If reflux wakes you, rolling to your left is a simple move that often helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut microbiome is not silent during sleep. A 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183306/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; reported that shorter sleep in older adults was tied to more pro-inflammatory bacteria, while higher sleep quality tracked with more Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causation is harder to prove, but a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using two sample &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00092-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; found specific gut taxa that were causally linked with sleep traits, including sleep duration and chronotype. Some short chain fatty acid producers were associated with longer sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the idea that better sleep habits can improve the mix of microbes that support gut health. They also show why sleep problems can ripple into digestion in ways you can measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-peptic-ulcers-and-night-shifts"&gt;Peptic ulcers and night shifts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift work scrambles the circadian rhythm, and the stomach pays attention to that clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://jhsss.sums.ac.ir/article_50452.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; found that five of eight included studies reported higher peptic ulcer risk in shift workers, with some studies showing more than double the prevalence versus day workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also called for practical fixes at work, like steadier schedules and better meal timing, to reduce risk. That advice pairs well with personal sleep hygiene at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-health-and-sleep-positions"&gt;Heart health and sleep positions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with heart failure, the left side can feel uncomfortable because of pressure from an enlarged, pounding apex of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic 2001 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11401112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found patients with heart failure spent about twice as much time on the right as on the left or back, and the right side normalized an off-balance autonomic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side sleeping also tends to lessen snoring. Back sleeping can worsen sleep disordered breathing, which stresses the heart over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live with a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/easiest-habit-for-taking-care-of-your-heart-and-living-longer-walk-brisk-pace/"&gt;cardiac condition&lt;/a&gt; or have an implanted device, ask your clinician which position works best for your symptoms. Personal advice beats one size fits all rules for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people without heart or lung disease do well on the left for reflux and on either side for breathing. If you have positional sleep apnea, your sleep doctor may coach you toward side &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hijacks-the-brain-disrupting-sleep-and-memory/"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-ways-to-sleep-smarter"&gt;Practical ways to sleep smarter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reflux wakes you, favor the left side and give dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime. Use a pillow setup that keeps your neck and hips supported so your spine stays neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If heart failure makes the left side unpleasant, the right side is a reasonable choice. Keep the room dark, quiet, and cool, and stick to a steady schedule to help your body clock guide healthy digestion and cardiovascular rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:38:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNbWNWbGdWM29DalFvTndPa1VpRVE3d3JBYXJud2pnaTNzSFFqRUxPNUM4aktMRUpEd3I0dEtyZFpwYzA2MHlFUGZ5cmhUbnp3VHNNcFRnV193MEJ5Z1pVR2FNTU1zaEVFemZmcUZ6dGZ2VjFLU0RJSW1Kdmg0WEVpeTlZS19USTVMcjhHWndnQXpTRFB4bGlhSER3RDk</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家认为，这项运动将促进促进大脑生长的“奇迹分子” ，不，它没有运行-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/neuroscientist-suggests-this-exercise-will-give-a-boost-to-miracle-molecule-that-fuels-brain-growth-and-no-its-not-running/photostory/123919912.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The beauty of resistance training lies in its simplicity.

The researchers emphasized how risk rose with more consumption across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Demewoz-Haile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Demewoz Haile&lt;/a&gt; is a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle (&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IHME&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-daily-habits"&gt;Processed meat and daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who were asked to weigh in stressed how steady habits add up over time, and they pointed to the reliability of the pattern across many datasets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ischemic heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Haile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nutrition scientist urged people to limit these foods for the long haul rather than chase perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research, consistent with earlier findings, indicates that the best way to improve health is to avoid or keep intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and industrially produced trans fats as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a Burden of Proof approach, a type of meta-analysis that models how risk changes across the full range of intake while grading the consistency of the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most associations in this paper received two stars in that framework, which the authors describe as weak but still meaningful, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/processed-meat-can-cause-health-issues-even-in-tiny-amounts/"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; and other processed meat and ischemic heart disease receiving one star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose response curves rose steadily, and they rose fastest at the low end of intake. That shape helps explain why small daily portions can move risk in population studies even if the per person effect looks modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-counts-as-processed-meat"&gt;What counts as “processed meat”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat includes products preserved by smoking, curing, salt, or chemical preservatives, such as hot dogs, bacon, sausages, and deli meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IARC&lt;/a&gt;), with colorectal cancer as the main concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages cover regular sodas, fruit drinks that are not 100 percent juice, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12 ounce can is a common serving, and that size showed measurable links with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-these-foods-may-harm-the-body"&gt;How these foods may harm the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats often contain nitrite that can form &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nitrosamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nitrosamines&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that can damage cells in the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High heat cooking of meats can also produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, which have been tied to tumor formation in prior lab and epidemiology work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages deliver large amounts of rapidly absorbed sugar without much satiety, which drives excess calorie intake and strains insulin regulation over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/junk-food-diet-triggers-lasting-changes-in-the-brain/"&gt;trans fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, a pattern known to promote plaque buildup in arteries and increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-evidence-shows"&gt;What the evidence shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational data cannot prove causation, and dietary questionnaires can be imprecise, so caution is warranted when interpreting the size of the effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/mingyang-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mingyang Song&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HSPH&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reminded readers to avoid fear and to keep diet in perspective alongside activity, stress, and access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of recall based diet tools and differences in study design leave some uncertainty, but none of that erases the pattern that higher intake tracks with higher disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-human-health"&gt;Processed meat and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global guidance suggests keeping free sugars to less than 10 percent of daily calories and ideally closer to 5 percent, and that directly targets sugar sweetened drinks, as laid out in a World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guideline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Dietary Guidelines also advise limiting added sugars to under 10 percent of calories across the life span, a point detailed in the federal &lt;a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_dietary_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries are now removing industrial trans fats from the food supply, and the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/replace-trans-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REPLACE&lt;/a&gt; policy provides a template for doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means fewer packaged foods will contain partially hydrogenated oils, but checking labels remains wise because trace amounts can still show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/food/our-staff/gunter-kuhnle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Gunter Kuhnle&lt;/a&gt;, professor of nutrition and food science at the &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress does not require a perfect diet or a strict set of rules. Small, steady changes, like swapping a daily soda for water or seltzer and choosing unprocessed proteins more often, can bring intake closer to those targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNTGdPU3BfUjZFZzhXc0VMTkRlTkxKdFVVNDdVZzNVeU1WSXhpUVFkNkFaMFdObDlTeFNDTGJUUVVSWktod3FMRm1SWjNtRnNDMEJ5aWk4QUNvSmFPX0VBQ2pYelZMU09vUmlaOHdxV0gyRjlKV0d1d0VPWEd2cUpfc29VME9GazMyUkQ2eV82R3BRTDJLOFpWVWRnUjJweHBfU3dkNkZzeGRYa0dCbHYw</guid></item><item><title>青少年的第一个阴道癌症迹象被医生视为压力- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/disease/teens-first-sign-vaginal-cancer-dismissed-doctor-stress-rcna231607</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb5ba" class="body-graf"&gt;For a month in 2020, Liliana Castaneda, then 14, bled every day.

While it can cause some physical differences and impact a girl's growth, her ovaries do not develop, so she'll never menstruate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ced08" class="body-graf"&gt;When she started bleeding monthly at 14, she thought maybe she was going through puberty despite her diagnosis and felt excited by it. Soon, Castaneda realized what she was experiencing wasn’t normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8af28f" class="body-graf"&gt;“What I thought was a period ended up not being (one),” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4450b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Soon, the bleeding became heavier with Castaneda saturating a pad every 15 minutes. She also bled every day, which made her feel tired. Sometimes, when she stood up, she felt dizzy. At the time, she was at home during the COVID-19 lockdown, which made managing some of the symptoms a little easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0edf84" class="body-graf"&gt;After about a month of constant bleeding, she made an appointment with her doctor, Castaneda says. But her doctor dismissed her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-256b5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“At first, they thought it was just stress,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-880d7a" class="body-graf"&gt;Her doctor gave her birth control to manage the bleeding, but it didn’t help. When two months passed with no end to her symptoms, she returned to visit her doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c8e26" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was still bleeding,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-031916" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, her doctor ran testing first, conducting an ultrasound, but they “couldn’t see clearly,” so they decided to conduct a pelvic exam. Following that, they sent her for more testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69f2bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s when they did a biopsy,” Castaneda says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-644ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Three days later, Castaneda learned what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6fb56f" class="body-heading"&gt;Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Vagina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cb59b" class="body-graf"&gt;Clear cell carcinoma is a “subtype of vaginal cancer,” where the cells under a microscope almost look clear, says Dr. Dario Roque, a gynecological oncologist at Northwestern Medicine. It’s normally seen in post-menopausal women, but generally, “vaginal cancer is pretty rare,” Roque tells TODAY.com. The American Cancer Society estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/vaginal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaginal cancer&lt;/a&gt; accounts for about 1% to 2% of female reproductive cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a184f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Castaneda had Stage 2 clear cell carcinoma in her vagina and a mass the size of a “golf ball.” That tumor and her delayed diagnosis likely led to the excessive bleeding she experienced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd70af" class="body-graf"&gt;“The mass definitely grew,” he says. “To me, her tumor was large enough by the time she came to us, I wasn’t surprised her bleeding was still heavy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-670c6c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1547"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/teen-vaginal-cancer-zz-250916-04-b7b728.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/teen-vaginal-cancer-zz-250916-04-b7b728.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/teen-vaginal-cancer-zz-250916-04-b7b728.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/teen-vaginal-cancer-zz-250916-04-b7b728.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/teen-vaginal-cancer-zz-250916-04-b7b728.jpg" alt="Listening to music helped Liliana Castaneda cope with the chemotherapy and radiation she underwent as part of her vaginal cancer treatment."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Listening to music helped Liliana Castaneda cope with the chemotherapy and radiation she underwent as part of her vaginal cancer treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Liliana Castaneda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d9ed3" class="body-graf"&gt;While he says it’s normal for doctors to consider a period when a 14-year-old has vaginal bleeding, it shouldn’t have been considered in Castaneda’s case because she has Turner syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e8fe78" class="body-graf"&gt;“That should have really never been on the differential diagnosis or the potential possibilities,” Roque says. “Their ovaries are not working, so they don’t go into menarche.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e03eae" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment of vaginal cancer depends on the size and location of the tumor. If the mass is small enough that surgeons can remove it with clear margins, surgery can be an option. Sometimes radiation is needed in those cases.

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas once the ways of getting fit were quite straightforward – going to the gym, heading out for a run etc – nowadays there are all kinds of weird and wonderful workout ‘methods’ gaining traction on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14102137/weighted-hula-hoop.html"&gt;weighted hula hoops&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14559665/10-20-30-viral-exercise-hack.html"&gt;10-20-30 hack&lt;/a&gt;, the internet is constantly coming up with new ways to stay fit and healthy, and one of the recent exercise routines to trend online is called ‘Japanese Interval Walking’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you haven’t heard of it before, you are certainly not alone, but essentially it’s a form of intermittent walking developed by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-137549f0-9317-11f0-9c24-3b2c6714de30"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to improve cardiovascular fitness and your metabolism. In practise, that means repeating the following five times, for a total of 30 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a brisk pace for 3 minutes: About 70-85% of your maximum heart rate. You should be able to speak, but you may find continuous talking a challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a more leisurely pace for 3 minutes and let your heart rate come down to 40-50% of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s not just an internet fad. The Japanese Walking Technique is supported by the research of Dr Hiroshi Nose published in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings.&lt;/a&gt; Compared to continuous walking at the same pace, the researchers found that ‘High-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking is the latest TikTok fitness method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent walking is also an easy method to try out. Jack Claxton, Personal Trainer at&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/"&gt; David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; says ‘switching between a brisk pace and a steadier one’ when you walk ‘is a great way to get more out of something most people already do every day. It gives your heart and lungs a stronger workout, helps you burn more calories in less time, and boosts stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Interval training in general also makes exercise more engaging because the change of pace keeps it varied and less monotonous,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how do you know what counts as high intensity walking? Well, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age from 220. If you are walking with a heart rate at around three-quarters of this number, as measured on a fitness tracker (e.g. a fitness watch), then that’s a good sign, but as Claxton says ‘A simple way to measure this is the “talk test.” If you’re walking quickly enough that you’re breathing heavily and can only speak in short sentences, that’s considered high intensity for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age - aim to be at 70-85% of this number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are ways to achieve this other than simply walking very fast. ‘Walking uphill, or using an incline on a treadmill, is another way to increase intensity without running,’ says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it can count as high-intensity, walking is also low impact, making it much gentler on the joints and more sustainable for most people, especially those who are older or recovering from an injury. ‘It’s also one of the most accessible forms of exercise because it requires no equipment and can easily be built into daily life,’ says Claxton. ‘On top of that, it’s a great stress reliever and often easier to stick to long term compared to more demanding workouts like running or aerobics’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Walking is brilliant for relieving stress, says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should ditch other forms of workout in favour of walking. ‘While walking is excellent for cardiovascular health, it doesn’t build strength or improve mobility on its own,’ says Claxton. ‘As we age, resistance training becomes crucial for maintaining bone density, reducing the risk of falls, and preserving independence in daily activities. That’s why it’s so important to combine walking with some form of strength training; even simple bodyweight exercises or light weights can make a big difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for his verdict on social media fitness trends? They have pros and cons, says Claxton. ‘On the positive side, they can motivate people to try new workouts and become more active, which is always a good thing. However, not everything you see online is safe, effective, or suitable for everyone. Many of these trends are designed more to capture attention than to genuinely improve health. My advice is to use TikTok as inspiration, but rely on proper guidance from a professional for your actual training.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet experienced it yourself, you’ve certainly seen older family members start to hold smartphones and restaurant menus up to their noses, squinting at the small text. That’s because as we age, we all develop presbyopia, or age-related farsightedness—trouble focusing on close objects or text. That’s where surgery or reading glasses usually come in, but new research suggests there could be another option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers have demonstrated that after taking special eye drops two or three times a day, most participants in a retrospective study could read an extra two or more lines on the Jaeger chart, an eye chart used to test near visual sharpness. Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, presented the research on Sunday, September 14, at the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Surgery is not for everyone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management,” Benozzi said in an ESCRS &lt;a href="https://www.escrs.org/channels/news/could-we-use-eye-drops-instead-of-reading-glasses-as-we-age"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Presbyopia seems to be the family business. It was Benozzi’s father, the late Jorge Benozzi, a researcher at his daughter’s same center, who developed the eye drops. The formula contains two active ingredients—pilocarpine, which constricts pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle (a muscle involved in the eye’s ability to see objects at different distances), and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that counters the inflammation and discomfort often caused by pilocarpine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 766 patients (373 women, 393 men, average age of 55) in the study took the eye drops twice a day, with the possibility of a third administration when needed. While everyone received eye drops with the same dose of diclofenac, the pilocarpine concentration was either 1%, 2%, or 3%. The researchers tested patients with the Jaeger chart an hour after the first administration and then continued monitoring them for two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances,” Benozzi told the congress, as noted in the statement. “Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;69% of the 248 patients who took the 2% formulation and 84% of the 370 patients taking the 3% formulation could read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart. The improvements seen in the trial lasted for up to two years, and Benozzi has patients outside of the study who have taken the eye drops for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More research needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pilocarpine can commonly cause, among other side effects, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, seeing flashes of light or “floaters,” and, in some rare cases, detached retinas. Some of the adverse side effects experienced by the patients in the recent study include temporary dim vision, irritation during the administration of the eyedrops, and headache, but no one discontinued the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline,” Benozzi explained. “Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benozzi argued that the eye drops are a convenient alternative for dealing with presbyopia that can reduce patients’ need for reading glasses, though they are not meant to replace surgery. “Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While the study is impressive for its large number of patients followed over a significant period, it’s limited by being a &lt;a href="https://www.ejves.com/article/S1078-5884(15)00523-7/pdf"&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt; single-center study—meaning all the patients were treated at the same center and their data was collected after the fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone,” said Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, in Germany, who was not involved in the study. “Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects … Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even with these limitations, the results hint at a future where a simple eye drop could help delay the need for reading glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400043b6qie8qty1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, &lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" target="_blank"&gt;former director&lt;/a&gt; of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400053b6qnjvc0mmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400063b6qdhz5qfuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400073b6qjha77pyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400083b6qszot77q3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400093b6qd10kohyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000a3b6q8qy7zxcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000b3b6q55mraq53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000c3b6qvfe7mawt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000d3b6qlbpdx98z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000e3b6qqsmwmxi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;opposing some public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000f3b6qxdf9bbum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000g3b6q44lkj3gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000i3b6qr8p312tm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000j3b6qlc01sbki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000k3b6qc6xu4tme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000l3b6qnof2g4j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000m3b6qwmaznndw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000n3b6qecdlcmzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000q3b6qcrcw9rnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The earlier an infection occurs, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the worse the consequences&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000r3b6qo61wz79e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000s3b6qr2nog8an@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000t3b6qwdapr128@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000v3b6quv9tl5hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000w3b6qtirkxn2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000x3b6qoiwlb5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt;often transmitted&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000y3b6qdbmts876@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj4000z3b6q5bkqnhzc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400103b6q0vzzraqx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;advise universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400113b6qdw8cnqwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400123b6qg4h7ywa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400133b6qvusz6qpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400143b6q84fbqw19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400153b6qu9qidscv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400173b6q9m59aajv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400183b6qwdt4i9bn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj400193b6qzuyrdh9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001a3b6qxp226pnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001b3b6qrukma1rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfmi9aj5001c3b6qbyzbp0pf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

This, in turn, may affect appetite.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found over half of participants (58.4 per cent) reported feeling generally less hungry (Ozempic: 61.2 per cent, Mounjaro 56.5 per cent, Wegovy 54.4 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, two-thirds reported increased satiety which is feeling full sooner after eating (Wegovy 66.8 per cent, Mounjaro 63.1 per cent, Ozempic 58.8 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A strong reduction in food cravings were reported by 41.3 per cent of Mounjaro users, compared to 34.1 per cent on Wegovy and 29.7 per cent on Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, further analysis revealed a link between changes in taste, hunger, and satiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who experienced an increased taste of sweetness were twice as likely to feel full more quickly after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they were a whopping 85 per cent more likely to have less cravings and 67 per cent more likely to have lower appetite. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found those who reported food tasted saltier were more than twice as likely to feel fuller sooner after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When dose, age and sex were taken into account, on average BMI reduced by 17.4 per cent with Ozempic, 17.6 per cent with Wegovy and 15.5 per cent with Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Moser explained: '&lt;span&gt;Shifts in taste may affect how satisfying or appealing food feels in the moment, which influences appetite control.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they didn't find a link between taste change and body mass index (BMI) reduction—but they suggest this is because it is only one factor in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Weight loss depends on many other factors like long-term eating patterns and activity not changes to taste alone,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also cautioned that the research didn't prove causation as it was self-reported and not representative of all users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Moser added: 'Monitoring patients' taste changes could provide useful clues about treatment response.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to News Medical Life Sciences, the fresh research was presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-2281e080-9302-11f0-a646-cd8514c6f2a7" class=""&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were also published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15100509/Weight-loss-jabs-effective-obese-children.html"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; study which suggested weight loss jabs could be highly affective on children as young as six who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis revealed children taking the drugs to treat obesity lost an average of 10lbs and saw their waistlines slim by 3.81cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it found they significantly improved youngsters' blood sugar control and weight, they more commonly suffered side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included 'gastrointestinal adverse events' such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOYnlIZzJ0UmJQRlNtZy16c3BDQVZXTldSeU4yNmdDNXJCU3NWQnc1TlFZbllOaW1udEVZaS0yWGljLXlBTW9MNW9zd1MwNTNEaW1wbURpZ3B2QmlkNENibnVFeWJ5TkkxWERVWEJLT2hfSEZDUU9QemRXWWZ4RzBtTFBIQU1xZ3Rudnpmc3IyTy0tU3pTQ0dsNERObHhndVp5YWNlZNIBqgFBVV95cUxNdi02WWM4cmk4NzZ5S0xpUV9HcHlBNHU4MkdLeTV4TUhTTTAzLVlRZk1aWXlTNlFCcWhyZTk2SFBhay1BcDFDSlFRbzJXYkZSbV9OLTNJdjFmTXZQUHItci15MGg4YzNieDhWVFVuWDdOLUZTYVJHY0x3aDhSSWFOeGhBWUV2c1hCNndFdVdoLVRNVkljaHlXU3h2UmloekVsdkVxc0ZWMDJSUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
