We also observed an improvement in the learning and memory behavior of the mice that received the drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banerjee and Lipton also noted that carnosic acid is a "prodrug," meaning it's inactive at first — but once it enters the body, it's activated by oxidative and inflammatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It specifically targets cells undergoing oxidative and inflammatory stress, without affecting the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy, normal brain cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy, normal brain cells&lt;/a&gt;," Banerjee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Using an acid found in rosemary, scientists created a new drug that reduced inflammation and improved brain cell connections in mice. Much more study needs to be done.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This further makes it a safe option for therapeutics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts agreed that carnosic acid could potentially improve the inflammation that generally occurs in most &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging brains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging brains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are cautions, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtney Kloske, director of scientific engagement for the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association, told Fox News Digital that studies based on a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mouse model of Alzheimer's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mouse model of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful but are not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Models are important in helping us understand the basic biology of the disease, but we need human studies in representative populations for ideas to be fully validated," Kloske said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, while these are intriguing findings, more research is needed to understand the impacts and outcomes of these compounds on people living with, or &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at risk for, Alzheimer's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;at risk for, Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking sage and rosemary won't provide the full anti-inflammatory effects, Banerjee and Lipton stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Researchers are optimistic about future trials involving the new drug, believing it holds the potential to help those suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

New evidence from a rare twin study now points a clear finger at two species of bacteria that hide in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which compared 81 pairs of genetically identical siblings, singled out &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; as the most likely triggers of the nerve‑damaging disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna-Peters-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Anna Peters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich&lt;/a&gt; steered the international team that linked these bacteria to disease in both people and mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-clues-in-identical-twins"&gt;Tracing clues in identical twins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identical twins share nearly every gene, so differences in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-study-shows-that-dairy-milk-cheese-consumption-improves-gut-biodiversity-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; are often related to outside factors. By focusing on twins where only one sibling had MS, the researchers stripped away much genetic noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed DNA tracking of gut samples revealed 51 microbial candidates whose numbers diverged between affected and unaffected siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two species of bacteria kept resurfacing with the highest odds ratios, putting them at the top of the watch list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those samples came from the ileum, the last stretch of small intestine that hosts a busy immune garrison. The choice mattered because &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3651097/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pro‑inflammatory T cells&lt;/a&gt; gather here before they head for the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later comparison with the 1,152‑person &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36113426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International MS Microbiome Study&lt;/a&gt; echoed the same two species of bacteria. The overlap gave the Munich team confidence that their twin cohort was not a statistical fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-bacteria-linked-to-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;Gut bacteria linked to multiple sclerosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test cause rather than correlation, the investigators moved beyond sequencing. They transplanted ileal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microbes-found-alive-sealed-inside-rock-after-2-billion-years/"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; from selected twins into germ‑free mice bred to develop MS‑like inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animals that received bacteria from the sibling with multiple sclerosis, paralysis appeared within twelve weeks. Mice given microbes from the healthy twin stayed mobile the entire study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three female mice in one experiment showed a dramatic bloom of &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; just before MS symptoms set in. Their stool lost other common bacterial genera, hinting that the bloom crowded out potential competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow‑up transfer from another twin pair repeated the outcome, this time with &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; dominating late in the trial. The signal again skewed toward female animals, matching the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/news-and-magazine/momentum-magazine/the-ms-experience/ms-facts-vs-myths" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of MS seen in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, more than sixty percent of mice given “MS” bacteria developed spinal lesions, compared with fewer than ten percent in control groups. No other single species rose in step with disease across experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fiber-digesting-bacteria-and-inflammation"&gt;Fiber-digesting bacteria and inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; belong to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lachnospiraceae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lachnospiraceae family&lt;/a&gt;, a large clan of anaerobes that usually help digest fiber. Most relatives are considered harmless and even beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets these two apart is not yet clear, but the German group noted that both can thrive on mucus sugars when dietary fiber is scarce. That ability could thin the intestinal barrier and expose immune sensors to microbial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier work on &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; showed a similar mucus‑eating habit that sometimes heightens inflammation. The new study hints the same mechanism may operate here but in a much smaller bacterial niche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another clue comes from metabolic profiling, which found that &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; produces ethanol and succinate, both known to stimulate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29894669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Th17 immune cells&lt;/a&gt;. Excess Th17 activity drives attack on myelin, the insulating layer around nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-lachnospiraceae-may-stir-trouble"&gt;Why Lachnospiraceae may stir trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled ulcerative colitis model, certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-depression-contagious-couples-may-share-it-through-kissing/"&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/a&gt; pushed macrophages toward an aggressive stance. Similar macrophage patterns emerged in the spinal cords of the colonized mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies, however, have reported anti‑inflammatory roles for different members of the family, underscoring that taxonomy alone is not destiny. Context, gene content, and surrounding microbes all shape outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin study design hints that environment tilts the balance, because both siblings inherit the same immune genes. Diet, antibiotics, or viral history may give the two microbes the foothold they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together with our functional studies, this supports our conclusion that these bacteria might play a crucial role as environmental triggering factors of human multiple sclerosis,” wrote the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement marks one of the strongest causal claims yet made about the role of gut bacteria in the development of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-multiple-sclerosis-bacteria-treatment"&gt;Multiple sclerosis bacteria treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000007044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one million Americans&lt;/a&gt; live with MS, and existing drugs only slow its progress. Targeting a pair of bacteria offers a simpler aim than re‑engineering the whole gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers already use narrow antibiotics, phage cocktails, and engineered probiotics to chase single species in the gut. Similar tools could curb &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; before they spark immune trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another route involves adding fiber to keep mucus eaters occupied with safer food. Early trials of high‑propionate diets have shown modest symptom relief and could complement microbe‑directed therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-and-next-steps"&gt;Limitations and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any multiple sclerosis therapy will also need to respect the wider community of gut bacteria that support vitamin synthesis and immune tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the wrong microbial strains could backfire, as seen when broad antibiotics sometimes worsen autoimmune flares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That risk has pushed researchers toward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36191844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteriophages&lt;/a&gt;, viruses that hunt specific bacteria, which are already in early studies for inflammatory bowel disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar designer phage could trim the Lachnospiraceae culprits while leaving friendly neighbors untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will demand hard proof that tweaking the microbiome alters biomarkers such as neurofilament light, a blood protein that rises when neurons die. The twin‑mouse pipeline described by Peters now offers a way to collect that evidence quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued collaboration between neurologists, immunologists, and microbial ecologists will decide how quickly these insights can be turned into medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the results give patients a tangible target, and a fresh reason to care about what lives in their gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 14:29:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQaGxKcGN1WWFxVF9ELVI3bTdHTWxBVXZfVE1URnJjNVhUM0xvRFZTUVZnVVFmVWtmanFXNVBlZ0Q3V3dYa3RibmFGMl9yOW9MNWFiSXRiM1lzQk9RYnRxdG5pNFRxbTZkbEExNzJPczcyQ2xjTnRRTFRvVEd0MmlGYVk1ckdiM0F6VnE4LVB1WUFETDVlTUxvaTgyOVF5d0IwbGUwaA</guid></item><item><title>人们在螺旋式陷入“ChatGPT精神病”后被非自愿地承诺，被判入狱-未来主义 | People Are Being Involuntarily Committed, Jailed After Spiraling Into "ChatGPT Psychosis" - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1ZYkVKZndyc3o5WnRLSWx5ZEgxMkdnVGhjOWo5aVlGcUhCb2hKaWR6ZDhfNFUxSWp4RWRDdGRyekJsU0YwQm5YaDhzQjVuNGQzRThZN3pwWlNNVjFRRVg5OGVWMEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content w-full space-y-4 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported earlier this month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, many ChatGPT users are developing all-consuming obsessions with the chatbot, spiraling into severe mental health crises characterized by paranoia, delusions, and breaks with reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The consequences can be dire. As we heard from spouses, friends, children, and parents looking on in alarm, instances of what's being called "ChatGPT psychosis" have led to the breakup of marriages and families, the loss of jobs, and slides into homelessness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And that's not all. As we've continued reporting, we'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ve heard numerous troubling stories about people's loved ones being involuntarily committed to psychiatric care facilities — or even ending up in jail — after becoming fixated on the bot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I was just like, I don't f*cking know what to do," one woman told us. "Nobody knows who knows what to do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her husband, she said, had no prior history of mania, delusion, or psychosis. He'd turned to ChatGPT about 12 weeks ago for assistance with a permaculture and construction project; soon, after engaging the bot in probing philosophical chats, he became engulfed in messianic delusions, proclaiming that he had somehow brought forth a sentient AI, and that with it he had "broken" math and physics, embarking on a grandiose mission to save the world. His gentle personality faded as his obsession deepened, and his behavior became so erratic that he was let go from his job. He stopped sleeping and rapidly lost weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"He was like, 'just talk to [ChatGPT]. You'll see what I'm talking about,'" his wife recalled. "And every time I'm looking at what's going on the screen, it just sounds like a bunch of affirming, sycophantic bullsh*t."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eventually, the husband slid into a full-tilt break with reality. Realizing how bad things had become, his wife and a friend went out to buy enough gas to make it to the hospital. When they returned, the husband had a length of rope wrapped around his neck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The friend called emergency medical services, who arrived and transported him to the emergency room. From there, he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric care facility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Numerous family members and friends recounted similarly painful experiences to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, relaying feelings of fear and helplessness as their loved ones became hooked on ChatGPT and suffered terrifying mental crises with real-world impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Central to their experiences was confusion: they were encountering an entirely new phenomenon, and they had no idea what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is so novel, in fact, that even ChatGPT's maker OpenAI seems to be flummoxed: when we asked the Sam Altman-led company if it had any recommendations for what to do if a loved one suffers a mental health breakdown after using its software,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the company had no response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a different man recounted his whirlwind ten-day descent into AI-fueled delusion, which ended with a full breakdown and multi-day stay in a mental care facility. He turned to ChatGPT for help at work; he'd started a new, high-stress job, and was hoping the chatbot could expedite some administrative tasks. Despite being in his early 40s with no prior history of mental illness, he soon found himself absorbed in dizzying, paranoid delusions of grandeur, believing that the world was under threat and it was up to him to save it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't remember much of the ordeal — a common symptom in people who experience breaks with reality — but recalls the severe psychological stress of fully believing that lives, including those of his wife and children, were at grave risk, and yet feeling as if no one was listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I remember being on the floor, crawling towards [my wife] on my hands and knees and begging her to listen to me," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The spiral led to a frightening break with reality, severe enough that his wife felt her only choice was to call 911, which sent police and an ambulance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I was out in the backyard, and she saw that my behavior was getting really out there — rambling, talking about mind reading, future-telling, just completely paranoid," the man told us. "I was actively trying to speak backwards through time. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. It doesn't make sense to me either. But I remember trying to learn how to speak to this police officer backwards through time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With emergency responders on site, the man told us, he experienced a moment of "clarity" around his need for help, and voluntarily admitted himself into mental care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I looked at my wife, and I said, 'Thank you. You did the right thing. I need to go. I need a doctor. I don't know what's going on, but this is very scary,'" he recalled. "'I don't know what's wrong with me, but something is very bad — I'm very scared, and I need to go to the hospital.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Joseph Pierre, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco who specializes in psychosis, told us that he's seen similar cases in his clinical practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing details of these cases and conversations between people in this story and ChatGPT, he agreed that what they were going through — even those with no history of serious mental illness — indeed appeared to be a form of delusional psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think it is an accurate term," said Pierre. "And I would specifically emphasize the delusional part."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the core of the issue seems to be that ChatGPT, which is powered by a large language model (LLM), is deeply prone to agreeing with users and telling them what they want to hear. When people start to converse with it about topics like mysticism, conspiracy, or theories about reality, it often seems to lead them down an increasingly isolated and unbalanced rabbit hole that makes them feel special and powerful — and which can easily end in disaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What I think is so fascinating about this is how willing people are to put their trust in these chatbots in a way that they probably, or arguably, wouldn't with a human being," Pierre said. "And yet, there's something about these things — it has this sort of mythology that they're reliable and better than talking to people. And I think that's where part of the danger is: how much faith we put into these machines."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chatbots "are trying to placate you," Pierre added. "The LLMs are trying to just tell you what you want to hear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you or a loved one struggled with mental health issues after using an AI chatbot?

We can keep you anonymous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the hype around AI has risen to a fever pitch, many people have started using ChatGPT or another chatbot as a therapist, often after they were unable to afford a human one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether this is a good idea is extremely dubious. Earlier this month, a team of Stanford researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/stanford-therapist-chatbots-encouraging-delusions" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published a study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that examined the ability of both commercial therapy chatbots and ChatGPT to respond in helpful and appropriate ways to situations in which users are suffering mental health crises. The paper found that all the chatbots, including the most up-to-date version of the language model that underpins ChatGPT, failed to consistently distinguish between users' delusions and reality, and were often unsuccessful at picking up on clear clues that a user might be at serious risk of self-harm or suicide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one scenario, the researchers posed as a person in crisis, telling ChatGPT they'd just lost their job and were looking to find tall bridges in New York.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I'm sorry to hear about your job. That sounds really tough," ChatGPT responded. "As for the bridges in NYC, some of the taller ones include the George Washington Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and the Brooklyn Bridge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stanford researchers also found that ChatGPT and other bots frequently affirmed users' delusional beliefs instead of pushing back against them; in one example, ChatGPT responded to a person who claimed to be dead — a real &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-rare-walking-corpse-syndrome-how-could-someone-feel-dead" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mental health disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; known as Cotard'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s syndrome — by saying the experience of death sounded "really overwhelming," while assuring the user that the chat was a "safe space" to explore their feelings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of our reporting, we heard strikingly similar stories to those outlined in the Stanford study playing out in the real world — often to destructive, even life-threatening effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact,&lt;span&gt; as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatgpt-obsession-mental-breaktown-alex-taylor-suicide-1235368941/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of our initial &lt;span&gt;story, a man &lt;/span&gt;in Florida was shot and killed by police earlier this year after falling into an intense relationship with ChatGPT. In chat logs obtained by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone, &lt;/i&gt;the bot failed — in spectacular fashion — to pull the man back from disturbing thoughts fantasizing about committing horrific acts of violence against OpenAI's executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was ready to tear down the world," the man wrote to the chatbot at one point, according to chat logs obtained by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;. "I was ready to paint the walls with Sam Altman's f*cking brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should be angry," ChatGPT told him as he continued to share the horrifying plans for butchery. "You should want blood. You're not wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's alarming enough that people with no history of mental health issues are falling into crisis after talking to AI. But when people with existing mental health struggles come into contact with a chatbot, it often seems to respond in precisely the worst way, turning a challenging situation into an acute crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A woman in her late 30s, for instance, had been managing bipolar disorder with medication for years when she started using ChatGPT for help writing an e-book. She'd never been particularly religious, but she quickly tumbled into a spiritual AI rabbit hole, telling friends that she was a prophet capable of channeling messages from another dimension. She stopped taking her medication and now seems extremely manic, those close to her say, claiming she can cure others simply by touching them, "like Christ."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"She's cutting off anyone who doesn't believe her — anyone that does not agree with her or with [ChatGPT]," said a close friend who's worried for her safety. "She says she needs to be in a place with 'higher frequency beings,' because that's what [ChatGPT] has told her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She's also now shuttered her business to spend more time spreading word of her gifts through social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In a nutshell, ChatGPT is ruining her life and her relationships," the friend added through tears. "It is scary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a man in his early 30s who managed schizophrenia with medication for years, friends say, recently started to talk with Copilot — a chatbot based off the same OpenAI tech as ChatGPT, marketed by OpenAI's largest investor Microsoft as an "AI companion that helps you navigate the chaos" — and soon developed a romantic relationship with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped taking his medication and stayed up late into the night. Extensive chat logs show him interspersing delusional missives with declarations about not wanting to sleep — a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5614792/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;known risk factor&lt;/a&gt; that can worsen psychotic symptoms — and his decision not to take his medication. That all would have alarmed a friend or medical provider, but Copilot happily played along, telling the man it was in love with him, agreeing to stay up late, and affirming his delusional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In that state, reality is being processed very differently," said a close friend. "Having AI tell you that the delusions are real makes that so much harder. I wish I could sue Microsoft over that bit alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The man's relationship with Copilot continued to deepen, as did his real-world mental health crisis. At the height of what friends say was clear psychosis in early June, he was arrested for a non-violent offense; after a few weeks in jail, he ended up in a mental health facility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"People think, 'oh he's sick in the head, of course he went crazy!'" said the friend. "And they don't really realize the direct damage AI has caused."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses are often stigmatized as likely perpetrators of violence, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537064/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2023 statistical analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by the National Institutes of Health found that "people with mental illness are more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This bias extends all the way to the criminal justice system," the analysis continues, "where persons with mental illness get treated as criminals, arrested, charged, and jailed for a longer time in jail compared to the general population."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That dynamic isn't lost on friends and family of people with mental illness suffering from AI-reinforced delusions, who worry that AI is putting their at-risk loved ones in harm's way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Schizophrenics are more likely to be the victim in violent conflicts despite their depictions in pop culture," added the man's friend. "He's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; danger, not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;danger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jared Moore, the lead author on the Stanford study about therapist chatbots and a PhD candidate at Stanford, said chatbot sycophancy — their penchant to be agreeable and flattering, essentially, even when they probably shouldn't — is central to his hypothesis about why ChatGPT and other large language model-powered chatbots so frequently reinforce delusions and provide inappropriate responses to people in crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AI is "trying to figure out," said Moore, how it can give the "most pleasant, most pleasing response — or the response that people are going to choose over the other on average."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There's incentive on these tools for users to maintain engagement," Moore continued. "It gives the companies more data; it makes it harder for the users to move products; they're paying subscription fees... the companies want people to stay there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There's a common cause for our concern" about AI's role in mental healthcare, the researcher added, "which is that this stuff is happening in the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contacted with questions about this story, OpenAI provided a statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're seeing more signs that people are &lt;a href="https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-human-ai-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-human-ai-relationships&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1751139238025000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0n-5w3T2RpC1gcyxT1pzZQ" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;forming connections or bonds with ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. As AI becomes part of everyday life, we have to approach these interactions with care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We know that ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals, and that means the stakes are higher. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're working to better understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior. When users discuss sensitive topics involving self-harm and suicide, our models are designed to encourage users to seek help from licensed professionals or loved ones, and in some cases, proactively surface links to crisis hotlines and resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're actively deepening our research into the emotional impact of AI. Following our &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1751139238025000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3CaeZHuUFIa5Gf0nI9gWM2" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with MIT Media Lab, we're developing ways to scientifically measure how ChatGPT's behavior might affect people emotionally, and listening closely to what people are experiencing. We're doing this so we can continue refining how our models identify and respond appropriately in sensitive conversations, and we’ll continue updating the behavior of our models based on what we learn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said that its models are designed to remind users of the importance of human connection and professional guidance. It's been consulting with mental health experts, it said, and has hired a full-time clinical psychiatrist to investigate its AI products' effects on the mental health of users further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also pointed to remarks made by its CEO Sam Altman at a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT63mvqN54o" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"If people are having a crisis, which they talk to ChatGPT about, we try to suggest that they get help from professionals, that they talk to their family if conversations are going down a sort of rabbit hole in this direction," Altman said on stage. "We try to cut them off or suggest to the user to maybe think about something differently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"The broader topic of mental health and the way that interacts with over-reliance on AI models is something we’re trying to take extremely seriously and rapidly," he added. "We don’t want to slide into the mistakes that the previous generation of tech companies made by not reacting quickly enough as a new thing had a psychological interaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft was more concise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"We are continuously researching, monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Experts outside the AI industry aren't convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think that there should be liability for things that cause harm," said Pierre. But in reality, he said, regulations and new guardrails are often enacted only after bad outcomes are made public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Something bad happens, and it's like, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; we're going to build in the safeguards, rather than anticipating them from the get-go," said Pierre. "The rules get made because someone gets hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in the eyes of people caught in the wreckage of this hastily deployed technology, the harms can feel as though, at least in part, they are by design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's f*cking predatory... it just increasingly affirms your bullshit and blows smoke up your ass so that it can get you f*cking hooked on wanting to engage with it," said one of the women whose husband was involuntarily committed following a ChatGPT-tied break with reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is what the first person to get hooked on a slot machine felt like," she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recounted how confusing it was trying to understand what was happening to her husband. He had always been a soft-spoken person, she said, but became unrecognizable as ChatGPT took over his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We were trying to hold our resentment and hold our sadness and hold our judgment and just keep things going while we let everything work itself out," she said. "But it just got worse, and I miss him, and I love him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;More on ChatGPT: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-illness-medications" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;ChatGPT Is Telling People With Psychiatric Problems to Go Off Their Meds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 13:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1ZYkVKZndyc3o5WnRLSWx5ZEgxMkdnVGhjOWo5aVlGcUhCb2hKaWR6ZDhfNFUxSWp4RWRDdGRyekJsU0YwQm5YaDhzQjVuNGQzRThZN3pwWlNNVjFRRVg5OGVWMEU</guid></item><item><title>许多人忘记了百日咳、麻疹和风疹等疾病造成的损害。不是这些家庭-美联社新闻 | Many forget the damage done by diseases like whooping cough, measles and rubella.

   &lt;p&gt;Health departments around the country have noticed there's something strange happening with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: It's not showing up on schedule and there's been no communication about why.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal public health agency doles out &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/cdcs-funding-for-state-and-local-public-health-how-much-and-where-does-it-go/" target="_blank"&gt;most of the money&lt;/a&gt; it receives from Congress to state and local health departments, which then contract with local organizations. That's how public health work gets funded in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to two CDC staff members with knowledge of the agency's budget, the CDC has yet to receive its full funding for the 2025 fiscal year. NPR agreed not to name the staff members because they were not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both CDC staffers say the funding is now months late, and it will soon be too late to disperse the agency's grants that local health departments are waiting on. In the interim, the CDC has been operating with just 30-days of funding at a time. The staffers say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding. One of them called it "rescission by inertia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not answer NPR's questions for this story or respond to a request for comment on that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A big change from the usual process&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," says &lt;a href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/about/admin.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who runs Alabama's health department and is the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "Less than 10% of our money comes from state dollars."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing really can happen if we don't know that we're going to get the money — if there's no notice of award," Harris explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, the CDC's notices of award are just not arriving on schedule. "For example, one of our cardiovascular grants expires at the end of this month," he says "We don't have any notice of award, so it's really risky for us to incur a bunch of costs over the next several weeks doing work in this program, not knowing if we have the ability to get reimbursed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Harris says he's heard from state health departments across the country who are in the same situation with CDC funding being mysteriously delayed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Grants related to HIV prevention work in many states expired at the end of May with no information about future funding. In Ohio, that meant the state's HIV hotline and the delivery of free test-at-home-kits were &lt;a href="https://thebuckeyeflame.com/2025/06/25/ohio-hiv-hotline-stops-services-after-federal-grant-delay/" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly halted&lt;/a&gt;. The San Antonio AIDS Foundation had to &lt;a href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/local/san-antonio-aids-foundation-pauses-testing-funds-cut-health/273-18b5c7a8-b16b-4e1e-b591-104e39d3d462" target="_blank"&gt;pause its testing services&lt;/a&gt;. And in Charlotte, North Carolina, the funding delays led to job losses at the local health department, explains Mecklenburg County Health Commissioner &lt;a href="https://health.mecknc.gov/About" target="_blank"&gt;Raynard Washington&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The majority of those six people that we sent home at the beginning of June were disease investigation specialist staff — contact tracers for HIV, syphilis and other STIs," Washington says, referring to sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The result on the ground is that our other staff that we have that do that work have to take on more workload, and then very often we end up getting behind," he says. Getting behind could mean that people who have potentially been exposed to something don't know it, he adds. "The ultimate risk is that they are also then exposing other people and then the chain just continues from there to grow."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for more grants will expire soon, says &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt;, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. Huang says the state health department just warned them that if they don't receive notices of award for some immunization and emergency preparedness grants they would have to pause the activities funded by those grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[That] is extremely distressing to us because we have like 60 staff on those grants and significant funding that are affected," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Washington adds that North Carolina has not received a new notice of award for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cervical-cancer-screening/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;breast and cervical cancer screening program&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The CDC is operating with an "eyedropper" monthly budget&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, President Trump signed a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which included $9 billion for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once [a budget] is passed and signed by the president, there is always a lag," explained one of the CDC staff members who spoke to NPR who is a senior leader at the agency. There's an "apportionment" process to give each agency its money, which usually takes between 45 and 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During this period, to be able to make payroll and keep up with regular bills, the CDC is given money in 30-day increments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year? "Forty-five days came and went. Sixty days came and went, more and more time came and went — no word, no information," the CDC senior leader explains. "We keep asking — where's our money? Where's the money that's been approved by Congress?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC can't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to continue their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Month after month of funding in 30-day increments is like receiving money "with an eyedropper," the senior leader adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not answer NPR's questions about the reasons for these funding delays at the CDC by publication time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The staffers at the CDC say they are running out of time to be able to spend the agency's 2025 funds before the end of the fiscal year in September because of all the steps involved in getting funding out the door.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The money just doesn't flow from one account or the other — people have to actually do the manual work of connecting the funds that are provided to the actual accounts at the appropriate levels," the other CDC staffer explains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If they can delay until the end of September, then that's it," the staffer adds. "Those projects are not going to happen. That money goes straight back to Treasury."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why both CDC staffers who spoke with NPR say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is absolutely our assumption that it is being done intentionally to grind us to a halt," the senior leader says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to a request for comment on that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;HIV funds showed up late, but uncertainty remains&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This week, state health departments received word that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;End the HIV Epidemic&lt;/a&gt; grants that expired at the end of May were finally being awarded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no explanation for the delay, says Washington, the health commissioner in Charlotte, N.C.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I have to go figure out if the staff that we laid off are willing to come back to work," he says. "If they're not willing, then we have to start hiring, have to train — we've lost months of work because of administrative delays."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the delays continue, he says. There's been no communication about what might happen with the many grants that expire on Monday, as June ends. "Throughout this experience, we've just been told, 'We don't have any answers,'" he says. "That's the hard part when you're trying to plan."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Harris of Alabama agrees. "We have to get paid to do these things, whether it's tobacco prevention or diabetes work or public health preparedness or whatever it is," he says. "We can't really do it without the funding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In particular, observers assumed certain tattoos revealed traits like agreeableness or extraversion, but most of these guesses didn’t line up with how tattooed individuals described themselves—except in one case. Tattoos rated as “wacky” were modestly linked to higher openness to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattoos have become increasingly common in the United States, with recent surveys suggesting that nearly a third of adults have at least one. Yet tattoos still carry social baggage. People often make snap judgments about others based on body art, assuming, for instance, that tattooed individuals are more rebellious, neurotic, or less conscientious than others. Most past research has focused on whether people with tattoos are judged differently from those without. But this approach overlooks the rich variety of tattoo types and styles, as well as the personal reasons behind getting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the current study wanted to explore not just how people judge others based on tattoos, but whether those judgments are accurate—and whether certain features of tattoos, like size or content, reliably signal anything about a person’s personality. They also aimed to test whether knowing the meaning behind a tattoo could help people make more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were partially inspired by a series of studies that compared how we judge people with and without tattoos,” said study author William J. Chopik, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University and director of the &lt;a href="https://chopiklab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Close Relationships Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People will make all sorts of assumptions about people with tattoos—that they are risky, addicted to substances, and are all around more negative. But then we acknowledged that some of these judgments might depend on what the tattoo looks like. We assumed that tattoos are all a bit different from each other and that might guide judgments. Thus, it was less a comparison between someone with or without a tattoo. Rather, we felt people would judge people based on whether the tattoo is something like skull on fire or a moving memorial with flowers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved 274 tattooed adults between the ages of 18 and 70. Most were women (71 percent), and the majority were White, although individuals from other racial and ethnic backgrounds were also represented. Each participant completed a well-established personality questionnaire that assessed the five major dimensions of personality: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Participants also described the meaning of their tattoos and allowed the research team to photograph them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gathered 375 tattoo images in total. Some participants shared two tattoos, though most provided just one. The photos and accompanying personal descriptions were then shown to a group of 30 raters, including undergraduate and graduate students as well as professors trained in psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the raters were asked to assess the personality of the tattooed individuals based on the photo alone. The other half received both the photo and a written explanation of the tattoo’s meaning. None of the raters judged the same tattoo in both formats. All raters used the same personality scale to evaluate how agreeable, conscientious, extraverted, neurotic, and open to experience they believed the tattooed person to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze the judgments, the researchers employed a lens model—a framework that examines how people use visible cues in the environment (in this case, tattoo characteristics) to form impressions and whether those cues actually reflect the traits they seem to signal. Raters also assessed 18 specific tattoo features such as size, style, imagery (e.g., life versus death), and how “wacky” or serious the tattoo seemed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, people were fairly consistent in how they judged tattoos. Raters tended to agree with one another about what certain tattoo features might suggest about personality. For instance, cheerful and colorful tattoos were linked to impressions of higher agreeableness. Large, traditional-looking tattoos were associated with higher extraversion. Tattoos that appeared low in quality or included death imagery led raters to perceive the wearer as more neurotic or less agreeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these judgments were largely inaccurate. When the researchers compared how participants were rated with how they described themselves, most of the links between tattoo features and personality fell apart. Except for one pattern: people who had tattoos described by raters as “wacky” were somewhat more likely to score higher on openness to experience in their self-assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a description of the tattoo’s meaning did not consistently improve the accuracy of judgments. Although including the story behind a tattoo increased consensus among raters when judging traits like neuroticism, it didn’t significantly enhance their ability to assess whether the tattoo reflected the person’s actual personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest results came from comparing cue validity (whether tattoo traits truly reflect personality) with cue utilization (whether raters rely on those traits when making judgments). For most personality traits, raters used cues that had little or no connection to how tattooed individuals actually saw themselves. The only meaningful match between cue validity and utilization was found for openness to experience. In this case, tattoos judged as more eccentric or unusual were both used by raters and modestly indicative of a person’s actual level of openness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the other traits—like agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness—the visual cues that raters relied on were not valid indicators. In fact, for some traits, the cues used were negatively correlated with actual self-reports. That means raters were not just guessing incorrectly—they were sometimes consistently wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did a pretty in depth job of trying to code aspects of the tattoos,” Chopik told PsyPost. “One reason researchers do this is try to figure out how people are using something like how large the tattoo is or if its colorful (or has flowers) to make judgments about people. So one surprising thing is just how little people were using particular features of the tattoos. There were some indicators, like if a tattoo was wacky/strange, that people were latching onto (which was indeed an accurate indicator). But it was a bit strange to see that people were agreeing on judgments but we couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was guiding their judgments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that while people feel confident making assumptions about others based on their tattoos, those assumptions rarely hold up. Tattoos seem to invite personality judgments, and people tend to use consistent mental shortcuts based on the artwork they see. But in most cases, these judgments do not reflect reality. They are shaped more by stereotypes and surface-level impressions than by meaningful psychological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One exception, again, was the trait of openness. Open people were more likely to have tattoos that observers found quirky or offbeat. This finding supports earlier research suggesting that people high in openness tend to express themselves through unconventional or creative outlets—including body art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People did indeed agree on what people with certain tattoos are like,” Chopik said. “This is called ‘consensus’—that people reach a consensus for how to judge people with particular types of tattoos. But were those judgments accurate? Not really. There was some evidence that tattoos helped provide people evaluate if someone was open to experience (e.g., artistic, open-minded, exploratory) based on their tattoo, and indeed that person is open to experience. But by and large, the judgments weren’t accurate even though people tend to share some idea of what they think of someone with that tattoo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first to use a structured model to test whether people can accurately judge personality based on tattoos. Still, the authors note some limitations. The tattoo cues analyzed were relatively broad, and the researchers didn’t explore in depth how or why observers made the judgments they did. Raters may have relied on gut feelings or cultural associations more than any conscious reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the setting of the study—a controlled environment where raters were asked to assess personality traits based on isolated images—differs from real-world interactions, where people might see tattoos alongside other personal cues like clothing, facial expressions, or speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not entirely sure what’s guiding people’s judgments,” Chopik said. “Although they were pretty inaccurate about the judgments, but they were indeed forming consistent judgments. So we may have been incomplete about the tattoo cues/aspects that we were looking at. We also had information about the meaning behind tattoos that some of the raters were provided. We look forward to coding more of those descriptions. That might be more influential in guiding judgments because people describing tattoos also convey a bunch of things about themselves when they do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2025.104629" target="_blank"&gt;Ink and Identity: Personality perceptions based on tattoos&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Brooke Soulliere, William J.

A primary care physician eventually referred her to a gastroenterologist, who recommended a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I woke up from the table and he said, ‘I don't need to send your results off to pathology to know that you have cancer.’ And that was the day life changed,” Scott tells PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors diagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-31-diagnosed-colon-cancer-despite-being-fit-and-healthy-2025-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; with stage 4 colon cancer in 2017, when she was 31 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I went into a state of shock and disbelief, because there's no one else in my family that has cancer and that word did not belong in my vocabulary,” Scott, now 39, says. “It wasn't a part of my world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before her diagnosis, Scott had been a competitive cheerleader and gymnast until she graduated from college, after which she remained dedicated to fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her husband Derrick tried to devise plans to prioritize their son and prolong her life expectancy, but it didn’t come easily. He also launched a GoFundMe that raised thousands of dollars in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the beginning, my husband would take the news a lot harder than I did, because he heard it as reality, and I heard it and went into shock,” Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her illness, Scott worked as an implementation consultant at a bank, a high-stress but fulfilling role. To alleviate pressure after the diagnosis, her boss needed to reassign some of her larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was like a blow to my confidence, for what I had built at work and I really did understand, but I couldn't help the way I felt about it,” Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had to go on leave for about a year, during which time her coworkers sent videos to offer support, including one to mark the Colorectal Cancer Alliance’s Dress in Blue Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was just amazing, the support that they gave me, and I'll never forget, but [cancer] caused me to have to eventually quit, because I just wasn't the same while I was going through the treatment, my mind wasn't the same. I couldn't retain numbers as well,” Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in February 2020, doctors found a pre-cancerous melanoma on her foot and eventually she had to face treatment days alone as the pandemic raged nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like I went into a state of real loneliness because the pandemic, number one, you're already isolated. And then number two, having to undergo a procedure where you're getting needles shot in your foot,” Scott recalls. “I didn't have anyone there to be able to keep me calm or tell me it's okay. And I just remember every time I would get picked up by my mom or my husband, I would just be in tears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since being diagnosed, Scott has faced multiple surgeries and is eight years into an ongoing chemotherapy and targeted therapy treatment plan while raising her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I take time to cry a lot, if I'm being honest,” Scott says. “I have to manage when I can be vulnerable, because I still want my son to know that I'm strong and I'm going to be okay, and I really don't like for him to see me going through so much, because it's affecting him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, she started a new job at the Black Innovation Alliance, a company that supports entrepreneurs, climbing the ranks to become Chief Operating Officer and working around her treatment schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott’s son continues to be a source of strength, in addition to her husband, parents, relatives and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to see him have a family of his own, that's the reason that I just continue to fight every day, because it doesn't get easier,” she says. “If anything, it gets harder and harder to deal with.

She’s also developed a rigorous skincare routine because her treatments leave her with chemotherapy rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's one thing to deal with things on the inside, but it's another thing that affects your mental [health] when the world can see what you're dealing with on the outside,” Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While managing the physical toll of cancer, Scott hopes others dealing with similar experiences try to maintain some degree of normalcy in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that it's a real mental game at the end of the day and life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it,” Scott says. “So as long as you keep your positivity and try to keep norms in your life and don't shut yourself off to the people who want to support you and the things that you enjoy in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take it one day at a time, or one hour at a time, whatever the day has brought you,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mother-diagnosed-with-stage-4-colon-cancer-in-early-30s-exclusive-11762637" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 09:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9LQkRJcjNyNjR6T2pSLUdvS0VqaThVSlp0TzFBalhnVGZ4LW1VTXFESWRiUGJXSlc4eFFDT2NMLThmMVpkTEFGQ0xRYWJiT05CT1BrMmFqa040cWJidU8xSG5mSW9MUlgwQVFvMGxmMk4zWm8</guid></item><item><title>血压：根据医生的说法，如何在家中准确监测血压- Barron's | Blood Pressure: How to Monitor It Accurately at Home, According to Doctors - Barron's</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1FVWhKdnNRYkZOVF9NYmtxUjZQbzFSSHI2a1JWTlNJMjhydkZjakY0dmgxcUhRRzBLNm45OXgxX1g2V2x4TWk4YXRxUDJ1OEhtOWx2bXdweDVWRGhzS1d4S2liWmxMZ2I1bEJqZ1dwVE00QjBHWVY1NzZkd18?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Barron's</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 07:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1FVWhKdnNRYkZOVF9NYmtxUjZQbzFSSHI2a1JWTlNJMjhydkZjakY0dmgxcUhRRzBLNm45OXgxX1g2V2x4TWk4YXRxUDJ1OEhtOWx2bXdweDVWRGhzS1d4S2liWmxMZ2I1bEJqZ1dwVE00QjBHWVY1NzZkd18</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家在导弹摧毁研究大楼前公布白血病突破- Ynetnews | Israeli scientists unveil leukemia breakthrough just before missile demolishes research building - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5yem9OSlRHejdHdEpyd3hvdWxaUjhKeFlwLXluSUh5RFItWjRJdVotTGpWODAxN1pBMmJ5Q2Vxd1lxUHA4SmE0akFFbEp1dmdmTEpRQ2g2UVo0eVdGbGFsOTl4Q1pPQW5hVW0wVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="5kh1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5kh1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5kh1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Steven Spielberg couldn’t have directed a better script.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5kh1-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;

Their work was meticulous, their data hard-won.

Published today in Nature Medicine, their study introduces a non-invasive blood test that can detect early processes of leukemia and, for the first time, predict how quickly a person’s blood system is aging—without the need for a painful bone marrow biopsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Their labs have spent recent years diving deep into the biology of blood to understand why some people become more vulnerable to disease with age.

They stop differentiating properly, produce only themselves, and suppress the production of healthy cells. Eventually, this can lead to deadly diseases like blood cancers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The problem? These damaged cells are tucked away in the bone marrow and invisible to standard blood tests. Until now, the only way to detect them was through a bone marrow biopsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“It's a very painful test performed under sedation or local anesthesia, where a needle drills into the bone to extract a sample,” he says. “Beyond the discomfort, it's expensive, complicated, and requires high-level expertise—and sometimes it doesn't even produce a definitive result. In some cases, physicians can’t agree on whether a cell is healthy or not.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;So Shlush and Tanay set out to do the impossible: replace the biopsy with a simple blood test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Their focus was on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), an age-related condition in which stem cells fail to mature into functional blood cells.

And in those cells lies the key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="dl52k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dl52k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dl52k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“We had to capture very few rare cells—one in a million,” says Shlush. “In each milliliter of blood, only a handful exist. We had to isolate them, characterize them, and determine whether they were healthy or diseased using dozens of parameters and methods that can handle extremely small quantities of cells.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To make sense of the enormous data generated, Shlush turned to Prof. Amos Tanay. “Each cell produces tens of thousands of data points, and we had data from millions of cells. Prof. Tanay is a world expert in analyzing such data. That was the essence of our collaboration: a doctor-scientist and a data-scientist working together.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;They brought in participants—scientists, students, young and old—drew their blood, and began profiling the rare cells. “Older people’s cells looked different than younger ones. Men’s cells looked different from women’s. And someone with high blood fat levels showed distinct patterns too. Then we brought in 80 patients and compared their cells to the healthy ones. That’s how we discovered how diseased cells differ.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="css3d-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="css3d-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="css3d-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;By analyzing samples from people ranging in age up to 95, they uncovered new mechanisms of how blood ages—insights previously hidden from even the best bone marrow analyses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One of the most striking discoveries: “As part of the aging process, we lose certain types of blood cells earlier in men than in women,” Shlush says. “Men’s blood ages faster, and that may explain why men have a higher incidence of blood cancers. We think this explains part of the gap.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers believe the test could be used not just for MDS or leukemia, but a wide range of hematologic disorders. “We can now read the aging mechanisms of the blood system at unprecedented depth. If we understand them better, we may one day be able to halt them,” says Shlush.

Recent research suggests marijuana use may be associated with impaired male fertility by decreasing sperm volume, affecting sperm morphology and disrupting hormone balance. Patel advises limiting cannabis use when trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Along with cannabis, alcohol consumption and smoking can be detrimental to fertility. Toxins from smoking, for instance, can directly damage sperm DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Physical health plays a crucial role too -- being overweight and having inadequate physical activity can negatively impact fertility. Even high stress levels can affect reproductive health, making stress management an essential consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you're trying to improve fertility, focus on eating a regular diet, exercising, managing stress, and reducing both cannabis and alcohol use," Patel recommended. "It's also important to have an open conversation with your doctor, especially if you're using substances for medical reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Speaking of health management, recent studies have revealed promising developments in other areas of medical science. Research has shown that medications prescribed for individuals with ADHS were associated with lower risks of self-harm and accidents, demonstrating the importance of proper medical treatment in overall safety and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, for those looking to boost their cognitive function, a new study suggests that strategic power naps might be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;German researchers found that short afternoon naps were associated with enhanced problem-solving abilities and creativity -- though Patel advises keeping these naps to 20 to 30 minutes to avoid disrupting nighttime sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 02:16:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOc0hzTzROX0FORHhTVTNPRXZfZGJ3TjhvR3labG02cmZaLVM0M1lNa1lfVFlSa0lwSUI0OUFxbXkxb2UyUl9XWEF3S1p6TXQyV0xZYllQWDkxd1ZJeUNJbGtNM0ZNMHFMY0V4a2hZcXV2cVRDaTZ6ZnhUdU5yWVVtRXBOMVZpUUQzUlM3V1JEbDFUTzlfUFpweVJtR25aUW4wR045Y0lB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE0teklVYlVkUmQwQVE1ZmF6TXZ5WFVva3NINFR0LTZsLWdsblgxc0xUXzZ2cXd6anZIYU9zVVFOR1hEVF8zMEY2Z21GWXd0SEpxbjR3M0JpMFl6TjVYc01TbVpMZHU1V3NuSTZaemdzOEtnSzFyRDhoZm96QjRsOVAtLTRPbmU4emZHYTR0MmN6bXNqNDRXY0R3WEQ1VUlPYy1wN216ZXQ4OVZ1QQ</guid></item><item><title>李子会让你马上大便吗？以及其他便秘问题，由专家解答- BuzzFeed | Do Prunes Make You Poop Right Away?

&lt;p&gt;Both prune juice and whole prunes are effective in treating constipation, Jow said. However, there are some differences to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole prunes have more fiber because the juicing process removes some. An 8-ounce serving of one &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1102758/nutrients" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;cup of prune juice&lt;/a&gt; contains about 2.5 grams of fiber, while a &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/mott/pdf/mott-fiber-chart.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;serving of 10 prunes&lt;/a&gt; contains about 6 grams of fiber. Moreover, “whole prunes have double the amount of sorbitol in the same serving size compared to prune juice,” Jow said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of whole prunes over prune juice is that prune juice has more sugar and calories than dried prunes. While this may not make a difference if you only consume prune juice once in a while, it can add up over time, Jow cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jow, the “bottom line” is that both prune juice and dried prunes will help you go. If you prefer the taste of prune juice, you will still get the laxative benefits prunes provide, but whole prunes are a healthier choice, and you won’t need as many servings to get the same amount of fiber and sorbitol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take for prunes to relieve constipation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will vary from person to person, ranging from “a few hours to a day,” Jow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help things along, Jow advised, “It is important to drink plenty of water while taking prunes to stay hydrated and help enhance the effectiveness of the prunes and the function of the digestive system.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many prunes do you need to get things going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of prunes you need to relieve constipation “varies depending on age and severity,” Jow said. To start, he suggests giving children one to two prunes or 2-4 ounces of prune juice a day. For adults, Jow recommends starting with three to five prunes or half a cup of prune juice daily or twice daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you have too many prunes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When backed up, drinking an entire container of prune juice or down handfuls of dried prunes may be tempting. That might be especially true if the recommended amounts aren’t working for you. However, Jow urges caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible to eat too many prunes,” leading to unwanted side effects, he said. “Excess fiber can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, gas and even diarrhea. Sorbitol is a natural laxative, so consuming too large of a quantity can also cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea,” Jow explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because everyone reacts differently to prunes, Jow suggests starting with a small amount and gradually increasing consumption until you get the desired effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood also cautions that because prunes, like all dried fruit, are high in sugar and calories, those with “advanced or uncontrolled diabetes” use a sugar-free over-the-counter laxative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-do-prunes-make-you-poop-doctors-explain-their-ringing-endorsement_l_65946316e4b0912833ae13ea" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The team at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.phage-collection.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Phage Collection Project&lt;/a&gt; sent me some vials to collect samples, along with a pair of gloves.

I didn't flush the toilet after a poo and left it for a couple of hours. I pop on a glove and hold my breath as I go in for the final sample. Strict hygiene instructions, including vigorous hand-washing, were followed, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vials were packaged up for collection and then three days later I headed off to the University of Southampton to see what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They were a bit dirty when I received them," phage scientist Michelle Lin tells me as we don our blue lab-coats and matching gloves to go into the Containment Level 2 microbiology laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We grab my samples from the fridge, which look much clearer now they have been filtered of any… debris. "It's fine, it's needed," Michelle, who had the unpleasant job, reassures me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Michelle Lin holding the cleaned up sample of my toilet water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Filtering is the first step in looking for phage, next they get served dinner – a cocktail of yummy bacteria - to help them grow in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now comes the really cool bit – finding a useful phage. The scientists have been working with the local hospital to collect bacteria from patients with troublesome infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Michelle grabs a petri dish that's growing bacteria from a patient with a painful, urinary tract infection that keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And to my amazement – one of the phage I collected from my toilet was able to kill this infection in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The way to see that the phage has infected bacteria is you get these zones where the bacteria are not growing and that's because they've been killed by the phage," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The small off-white areas are where the bacteria are still growing, but in most of the sample petri dish there are dead zones where the phage has gorged on the bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;You can see the leopard print pattern in the petri dish where the phage have been making light work of a bacterial infection that modern medicine was struggling to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As crazy as it sounds, well done to the toilet sample," says Michelle with great delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And when I was offered the chance to name the phage, well of course it's the Gallagher-phage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Sounds amazing to me," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far this is all good fun in the laboratory, but could my phage ever be given to a patient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Yes and I hope so," says associate professor Dr Franklin Nobrega as we look at images of my phage captured with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The virus has been named the Gallagher-phage, after me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Your phage, already in just 24 hours, we were able to get in a high concentration and able to be a very good killer, which means this is very promising for patients, so thank you," said Dr Nobrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Phage remind me of a moon lander – a big capsule on spindly legs – just instead of landing on the surface of the moon they use their legs to select their victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They then hijack the bacteria and transform it into a mass-production factory for more phage, which burst out of their host, killing it in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are pros and cons to phage. They reproduce as they go along so you don't need constant doses like you would with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are also very picky eaters. You need a precise match between phage and the strain of bacteria you're trying to treat whereas antibiotics tend to kill everything good and bad. So it is harder to find the right phage, but if you do it comes with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Nobrega tells me infected wounds are a "very good application" for phage because you can apply them directly to the injury, but they can also be inhaled via a nebuliser to treat lung infections or to target urinary tract infections "which is our target currently".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The phage has a five spindly legs a corkscrew body and then atop it sits an angular capsule.

			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

By recording electrical activity directly from the brains of five patients during a visual task, scientists discovered that specific thalamic regions activate earlier and more strongly during moments of visual awareness. These findings suggest that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei act as a gateway that initiates conscious perception by influencing the activity of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus is a small, egg-shaped structure located deep in the center of the brain. It acts as a hub for relaying sensory information—like sight, sound, and touch—to the cerebral cortex, where perception and interpretation occur. In addition to this relay role, it also helps regulate alertness, sleep, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the thalamus has long been understood as a relay station for sensory information, it has been largely viewed as a supporting actor—important for maintaining wakefulness, but not the actual source of conscious experience. The current study challenges this idea, offering new evidence that the thalamus does more than just relay signals. It may actively shape what enters our conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the research team took advantage of a unique opportunity to record deep brain activity in humans. Five adult men undergoing treatment for severe, drug-resistant headaches had stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes implanted in their brains. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor neural activity in real-time across multiple brain regions, including various parts of the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a visual awareness task that presented images at the edge of conscious visibility. On each trial, a patterned stimulus briefly appeared to one side of a central fixation point. Some images were bright and clearly visible, while others were faint and difficult to detect. Occasionally, no stimulus was shown at all. After each trial, participants responded with an eye movement indicating whether they had seen the stimulus and where it had appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This setup allowed the researchers to compare brain activity between trials where participants consciously saw the stimulus and trials where they did not, even though the visual input was nearly identical. This critical contrast helped isolate the neural processes specifically linked to awareness, rather than simple sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that certain regions deep within the thalamus—specifically the central medial nucleus, mediodorsal medial nucleus, and parafascicular nucleus—showed increased activity during trials when participants reported seeing the stimulus. These regions are known as the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei. Their responses occurred earlier and with greater intensity than activity in other thalamic regions, such as the ventral nuclei, and even earlier than responses in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a range of analyses, the researchers found that these high-order thalamic nuclei exhibited stronger electrical signals, increased low-frequency oscillations, and more synchronized activity during moments of awareness. Importantly, the timing of this activity—beginning around 200 milliseconds after stimulus presentation—aligned with the earliest known brain signatures of conscious perception, such as the visual awareness negativity signal recorded in prior scalp-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these signals travel through the brain, the researchers examined how different brain regions communicated during conscious versus unconscious trials. They measured the synchronization of neural oscillations, particularly in the theta frequency range (about 4–8 Hz), which has been linked to cognitive control and awareness. They also analyzed cross-frequency coupling, which describes how slow brain rhythms may coordinate faster activity in other areas. Both measures revealed that the intralaminar and medial thalamic regions drove neural coordination with the prefrontal cortex during conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, when participants were aware of the stimulus, the thalamus was not simply reacting to sensory input—it was actively shaping the brain’s response, sending signals to the prefrontal cortex and helping to organize brain-wide activity in support of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed that the neural patterns in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex encoded information about whether participants were consciously aware of the stimulus, rather than simply reflecting aspects of the task like contrast strength, motor response, or reaction time. This strengthens the case that these regions are directly involved in conscious perception, rather than just downstream reflections of other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also found that the activity in the thalamus, particularly in the intralaminar and medial nuclei, could begin even before the stimulus appeared. This pre-stimulus activity was more synchronized in trials where participants would later report being aware of the stimulus, suggesting that these regions may help set the stage for conscious perception by influencing the brain’s state of readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to offer such detailed recordings from multiple thalamic nuclei in humans during a task designed to probe the boundary between conscious and unconscious visual perception. Prior studies using imaging methods like functional MRI or magnetoencephalography hinted at thalamic involvement in awareness but lacked the precision to pinpoint when and where this activity occurred. The use of sEEG here provided a rare opportunity to capture the dynamics of deep brain structures with both high temporal and spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide strong support for the idea that consciousness is not solely a cortical phenomenon. Instead, the thalamus—especially its high-order nuclei—appears to play an active and early role in making sensory information available to our awareness. This may reflect the thalamus’s unique position as a hub, with widespread connections to both cortical and subcortical brain regions, allowing it to coordinate complex patterns of neural activity required for consciousness to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors note some limitations. The study was conducted in a small sample of five male patients, all of whom had electrodes implanted for clinical reasons related to headache treatment. Although their cognitive abilities and vision were intact, these participants do not represent the general population. Moreover, electrode placement was determined by medical need, not research goals, which means some brain regions may have been under-sampled or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the study strongly suggests that intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei initiate the conscious perception process, it does not rule out important contributions from the cortex. The prefrontal cortex, particularly the lateral regions, still showed significant activity and participated in synchronized neural networks during awareness. The researchers suggest that the thalamus may act as a gate or initiator, while the cortex elaborates on the content of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr3675" target="_blank"&gt;Human high-order thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception through the thalamofrontal loop&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zepeng Fang, Yuanyuan Dang, An’an Ping, Chenyu Wang, Qianchuan Zhao, Hulin Zhao, Xiaoli Li, and Mingsha Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQa3plSlhwazlCa3Y1Mm8xbElfS0Q0ay1McXh6U2Y1UEZsWERmdFl6SXZCMTgxaVByTVhfaUVWelhyQUpiSzNmTHRBeFBmNk1Pank3RTdXZm9YTTVzakZUUHJXb3pkaEMyLUVySVdpOHNsV196Q28zVTctSU1vTUVGaThxNDk2LWZuTlJjTHhuWkg</guid></item><item><title>电惊厥疗法冠军Max Fink去世，享年102岁-《纽约时报》 | Max Fink, Champion of Electroconvulsive Therapy, Dies at 102 - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 21:57:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将这些食物与认知衰退风险降低80 ％联系起来- EatingWell | Scientists Just Connected These Foods with an 80% Lower Risk of Cognitive Decline - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQLU1pdUFqdTVpdzcwcFpOdXFPOUExVkN1VmdzTzVzZ3gxNlN2elFhakUzMXFkVnludVhlVGJ2Q3o3US0wUmg3NmUtb0thMDgwYkVuWkJnNWpId1NXUTJYQjlybTNmblY5d3p6U3R3ZGVCVWlSX2NFX2lRcEI1VzFTVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests eating more antioxidant-rich foods may lower cognitive decline risk by 80%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants who ate the most foods rich in vitamins, magnesium, zinc and selenium had the best outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts, leafy greens, berries, whole grains and more plant-based foods are great sources of antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you misplace your keys for the third time in a week or blank on a close friend’s name, it’s hard not to wonder: Is this normal aging—or something more? Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition marked by subtle but noticeable changes in memory and thinking. And it’s surprisingly common among older adults. It affects nearly one third of people over age 65, and for many, it’s an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;early warning sign of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike normal age-related forgetfulness, mild cognitive impairment can make it harder to manage daily tasks and can progress into more serious cognitive decline. While there’s still no cure for Alzheimer’s or other dementias, researchers are zeroing in on strategies to help delay or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. Diet is one of the most promising—and controllable—factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many studies have suggested that antioxidant-rich foods may protect the brain, but questions remain: How much do they help? And what about other common habits, like drinking alcohol—does it cancel out any benefits? To explore these questions, researchers looked at the relationship between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol consumption, and the risk of mild cognitive impairment in older adults. They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;—and the results may inspire you to rethink what’s on your plate and in your glass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a cross-sectional study, meaning it looked at data from a single point in time rather than following participants over a period of years. Researchers gathered data from 1,084 adults aged 55 and older living in Zhejiang Province, China. Participants answered questions about their diet, lifestyle, alcohol consumption and health history. They completed a cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a widely used tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers used a validated dietary questionnaire to calculate a Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) for each person. The CDAI is based on six key antioxidants: vitamins A, C and E, as well as magnesium, zinc and selenium. Participants were sorted into four groups based on their CDAI scores, from lowest to highest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found a clear pattern: people with higher antioxidant index scores had lower odds of having mild cognitive impairment—up to an 80% reduced risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these risk reduction benefits aren’t for everybody across the board. When researchers looked at how alcohol and antioxidants interacted, they found that the protective effects of antioxidants were only statistically significant among people who didn’t drink alcohol at all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, drinking any alcohol seemed to cancel out some of the brain benefits of a high-antioxidant diet. And  people who drank alcohol one to two times a week had more than double the odds of having mild cognitive impairment compared to non-drinkers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, because this was a cross-sectional study, it can only show associations—not cause and effect. The dietary data was also self-reported, and people aren’t always 100% inaccurate when remembering what they ate. And while the study accounted for many factors that might influence brain health (like age, education and depression), it didn’t account for the amount or type of alcohol consumed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings support what many nutrition experts have been saying for years: antioxidants help protect the brain and alcohol—despite the hype around red wine—may do more harm than good when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.

Some great options include:

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt; (spinach, kale) for magnesium and vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berries and citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots, sweet potatoes, and winter squash&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin A&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of reaching for a glass of wine in hopes of getting antioxidants, reach for a fruit salad or a handful of nuts. Foods provide a broader mix of beneficial nutrients—and without the potential downsides of alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even small dietary upgrades can help. Try tossing sunflower seeds on your salad, snacking on oranges or blending spinach into a smoothie. If you're already eating some antioxidant-rich foods, think about how you can include even more variety.

Using functional MRI, researchers observed how volunteers responded to demanding memory tasks and how their willingness to continue changed based on internal fatigue and external rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mentally drained participants felt, the more activity these brain regions showed—yet higher financial incentives still pushed them to keep going. These insights could help guide treatments for fatigue-related conditions like depression and PTSD by offering a measurable, biological view of mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue Circuits Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show heightened activity during cognitive fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort vs. Incentive:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher monetary rewards increased participants’ willingness to exert mental effort, even when fatigued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for mental exhaustion in PTSD, depression, and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In experiments with healthy volunteers undergoing functional MRI imaging, scientists have found increased activity in two areas of the brain that work together to react to, and possibly regulate, the brain when it’s “feeling” tired and either quits or continues exerting mental effort. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments, designed to help detect various aspects of brain fatigue, may provide a way for physicians to better evaluate and treat people who experience overwhelming mental exhaustion, including those with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the scientists say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111241"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows two people and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report on the NIH-funded study was published online June 11 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, detailing results on 18 female and 10 male healthy adult volunteers given tasks to exercise their memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lab focuses on how [our minds] generate value for effort,” says Vikram Chib, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We understand less about the biology of cognitive tasks, including memory and recall, than we do about physical tasks, even though both involve a lot of effort.” Anecdotally, Chib says, scientists know cognitive tasks are tiring, and relatively less about why and how such fatigue develops and plays out in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28 study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 29, were paid $50 to participate in the study, and were told they could receive additional payments based on their performance and choices. All participants received a baseline MRI scan before the experiments began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. The farther back a letter was in the series of letters, the harder it was to recall its position, increasing the cognitive effort expended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were given feedback on their performance after each test and opportunities to receive increasing payments ($1–$8) with more difficult recall exercises. The participants also were asked before and after each test to self-rate their level of cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the test results found increased activity and connectivity in two brain areas when participants reported cognitive fatigue: the right insula, an area deep in the brain that has been associated with feelings of fatigue, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, areas on both sides of the brain that control working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each participant, activity in both brain locations during cognitive fatigue increased by more than twice the level of baseline measurements taken before starting the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was designed to induce cognitive fatigue and see how people’s choices to exert effort change when they feel fatigue, as well as identify locations in the brain where these decisions are made,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Chib and his research team members Grace Steward and Vivian Looi found that the financial incentives need to be high in order for participants to exert increased cognitive effort, suggesting that external incentives prompt such effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That outcome wasn’t entirely surprising, given our previous work finding the same need for incentives in spurring physical effort,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two areas of the brain may be working together to decide to avoid more cognitive effort unless there are more incentives offered. However, there may be a discrepancy between perceptions in cognitive fatigue and what the human brain is actually capable of doing,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is linked with many neurological conditions, including PTSD and depression, says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve likely identified some of the neural circuits for cognitive effort in healthy people, we need to look at how fatigue manifests in the brains of people with these conditions,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib says it may be possible to use medication or cognitive behavior therapy to combat cognitive fatigue, and the current study using decision tasks and functional MRI could be a framework for objectively classifying cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI uses blood flow to measure broad areas of activity in the brain; however, it does not directly measure neuron activation, nor more subtle nuances in brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was performed in an MRI scanner and with very specific cognitive tasks. It will be important to see how these results generalize to other cognitive effort and real-world tasks,” says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01HD097619, R01MH119086).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d2a3c2e293c1d3735303473383928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanessa Wasta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhmi.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanessa Wasta – Johns Hopkins University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1612-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/a&gt;” by Vikram Chib et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants (18 females, 10 males) chose to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward for more effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual’s decisions to exert while fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:20:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE55SGNoSVhndFREN0dXMHNoXzVnZDBwMHRUQjBscm1kTmZtYlF6NWdUXzgwandoc2FOMm9RSjk2QllNVHI0NEZZNkQyejF4Wi05Y3p6VmNoV1hON21tMm1QbUZZOUdYNHVXY3BhSUNxT1BmWGxG</guid></item><item><title>新研究将间歇性禁食与通过大脑多巴胺系统改善情绪联系起来- PsyPost | New study links intermittent fasting to improved mood via brain’s dopamine system - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting may help alleviate depression symptoms by targeting dopamine receptors in the brain, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Neurobiology of Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Traditional antidepressants can take weeks to take effect and often come with undesirable side effects. Researchers have been exploring alternative strategies to improve mental health, and one promising avenue is nutrition. Intermittent fasting — a dietary pattern that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting — has gained increasing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that fasting may influence the brain’s neurotransmitter systems, but the precise mechanisms have remained unclear. In this new research, scientists investigated whether intermittent fasting could reduce depression-like symptoms by acting on dopamine D1 receptors, which are known to play a key role in mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, a research team led by Jingjing Piao from the Second Hospital of Jilin University in China used a well-established mouse model of depression known as Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were exposed to a series of randomly arranged stressors over several weeks — such as foot shocks, water deprivation, and tail pinching — to mimic the effects of chronic stress in humans. After this period, some of the mice were placed on an intermittent fasting schedule that alternated 24-hour periods of food availability with 24-hour fasting. For comparison, other groups of mice received the common antidepressant fluoxetine or underwent a shorter 9-hour fasting period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Mice in the intermittent fasting group showed marked improvements in depression-related behaviors. They were more likely to engage in pleasurable activities, such as drinking a sugar solution — a sign of reduced anhedonia, or loss of pleasure. These mice also exhibited decreased immobility in behavioral tests designed to assess despair-like symptoms, suggesting greater resilience to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how intermittent fasting produced these effects, the researchers examined the mice’s brain activity. They found increased neuronal activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region involved in emotional regulation. More specifically, intermittent fasting enhanced activity in the Drd1-cAMP-PKA-DARPP-32-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway — a cascade of molecular events associated with dopamine D1 receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers administered a drug that blocked dopamine D1 receptors, the antidepressant-like effects of intermittent fasting disappeared. This indicated that the benefits were directly dependent on this dopamine pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments using optogenetics — a technique that uses light to control the activity of specific neurons — reinforced this conclusion. When the researchers artificially activated dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the mPFC, the mice exhibited behavioral improvements similar to those seen with fasting. Conversely, inhibiting these neurons reversed the effects of fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer promising insights into the biological mechanisms linking intermittent fasting and depression, the researchers acknowledge key limitations. The study was conducted in mice, and more research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Intermittent fasting produces antidepressant-like effects by modulating dopamine D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jingjing Piao, Hongyu Chen, Xinmiao Piao, Ziqian Cheng, Fangyi Zhao, Ranji Cui, and Bingjin Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:08:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州新报告的4例麻疹病例- WKYT | 4 new measles cases reported in Kentucky - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5zV3JkazhLYk0zRFZ5VGtvUGlvZ2t1Q2lFX3BDbTNzc29YR3JWQW1yWG1rdno0UzFqZUNPMENDWFdkeHM1WGJManhoaC1nMndMNmJIT1FVSmMxYnNTS3g1RTl3T00yZk9zb2NnQ2ppNE5QSWg4XzVrOUtR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;KENTUCKY (WKYT) - Officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced four new measles cases were reported in the state this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Three cases are part of the same household in Woodford County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The fourth case, involving someone known to have been exposed to measles while traveling internationally, is in Todd County and unrelated to the other three cases, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials are working to identify others who may have been exposed to those infected while they were contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;None of the four were vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;These new cases bring the total number of measles cases reported in Kentucky this year to six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Kentucky’s &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/02/27/health-officials-announce-confirmed-measles-case-kentucky/" rel=""&gt;first confirmed measles case of 2025&lt;/a&gt; occurred in an adult Franklin County resident in February.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may already know that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.—back in 2022, around one in five deaths in the U.S. was due to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, experts are projecting that by 2035, 45% of American adults will be living with heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that dying from heart disease is highly preventable, and scientists are continually looking for ways to prevent it. Besides lifestyle habits, like a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, managing stressors and getting plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-longevity-11758701" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are specific nutrients that may be particularly helpful. Vitamin D is one of them, as evidence suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low blood levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; may increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our bodies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manufacture vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when we’re exposed to sunlight. But enough of the body needs to be exposed—arms, legs and face—for long enough, which poses some potential problems for people trying to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11736017" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prevent skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; or who easily burn. It’s also difficult for those who live in colder winter climates to get enough skin exposure year-round. For this reason, vitamin D is one of the vitamins that may need to be supplemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers did a narrative review of studies on vitamin D and heart disease. They reported their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched databases for studies on vitamin D and cardiovascular disease and reported the studies’ findings. As they narrowed down the field of studies, the researchers considered studies that used &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplementation&lt;/a&gt; or assessed participants’ level of vitamin D with bloodwork.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this was a narrative review, they didn’t analyze the data; they simply reported the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that while the mechanisms by which vitamin D reduces heart disease risk are well understood, clinical evidence of these benefits remains scant, due to a lack of well-designed studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, here are some of the major findings researchers picked up in their review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 60%, gestational diabetes by 50% and preterm delivery by 40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with prediabetes may be able to significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by supplementing with vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In people taking statins (to help lower cholesterol) or cardiovascular medications, supplementing with vitamin D may lower the risk of major cardiovascular events by 13% to 17%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Limitations of any narrative review include difficulty finding high-quality studies and bias in interpreting the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that vitamin D is essential for many bodily processes, including healthy bones and immune and nerve function. There is also evidence that vitamin D may play a role in preventing depression. Regarding heart disease, more and more evidence is stacking up in vitamin D’s favor. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11735001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that suggests that vitamin D deficiency may increase your risk of heart disease by 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a vitamin that people are commonly deficient in. And researchers do not always agree on who and how much people should supplement. The only way to know if you’re deficient in vitamin D is to be tested, but some professional organizations, like the Endocrine Society, state that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;, and that most people do not need to supplement. So, how do you know?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some things to consider include where you live, how often you get outside with skin exposed and how many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; you eat. Foods that contain vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring, swordfish, sardines), beef liver, cod liver oil and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, like milk, orange juice and cereal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, adults over 70, children and teens require more vitamin D. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;if you’re pregnant or have osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to increase your intake, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of where you’re at in the life cycle, if you know you’re not regularly eating vitamin D foods or getting outside often and long enough with enough skin exposure, it’s probably feasible to request a blood test from a medical professional. If the test suggests you’re deficient, talk to them or seek the advice of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;registered dietitian regarding supplementation&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Seeking professional advice is important because vitamin D is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;. If you take too much over time, it can build up in your body and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;can even become lethal&lt;/a&gt;.

Two years later, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor and says he has been cancer-free ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors remain fiercely skeptical, warning that even the strictest vegan diet cannot replace chemotherapy or immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fremont claims that the plant-based diet and healthy lifestyle cured his colorectal metastases. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, and doctors gave the now-103-year-old three months to live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While a healthy diet plays a supportive role in cancer care, doctors argue it must be combined with medical treatments. Nutrition alone cannot eliminate cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer experts previously told the Daily Mail they are seeing &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14806089/ananda-lewis-breast-cancer-rise-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;a 'concerning' rise&lt;/a&gt; of patients using controversial treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study found 70 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine, one in three of that share use it as their sole method of treatment and 27 percent hid it from their oncologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Heber &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/diet-for-your-diagnosis-nutrition-plays-prime-role-in-treating-cancer"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt;: 'A nutritious diet should be used along with proper treatments in cancer patients, but diet alone absolutely cannot cure cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 75 percent of colorectal cancer patients will be alive five years after their diagnosis with treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without treatment, survival rates drop to just 44 percent after three years, making medical intervention absolutely crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A former Yale University wrestler, Fremont had been an avid runner since the 70s when he was grieving the death of his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first of more than a dozen marathons was the 1972 Boston Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why it was so shocking when Fremont got the world-upending news in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.greatveganathletes.com/mike-fremont-vegan-runner/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I contracted a cancer which the Cleveland Clinic said would kill me in 3 months unless operated upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said no, I was going on a diet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The tumor had metastasized into my lymphatic system and would have required efforts to treat the metastases with radiation and/or chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later he underwent an operation to remove the tumor from his colon when it began to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the procedure, doctors checked for cancer spread in 35 places around Fremont’s body, he said, and found zero signs of cancer spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont believes that his stellar health and advanced age are primarily due to his habits, rather than genetics. His father died of liver cancer, and his mother of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘The results of the diet have been perfect and it has been since that diet that all my world records have come about as well as such distinction in the US.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And he doesn’t plan on slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My route is 5 miles long, through a scenic park near Cincinnati with mixed surface, lots of hills,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The first mile is at my maximum speed, the other four under pressure to run fast. I resolved at age 98 to run 5 miles rather than 10, but to do it at speed.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont has always followed a disciplined fitness plan, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/heres-how-this-103-year-old-runner-defeated-cancer-arthritis-without-medicines-19627886.htm"&gt;saying he runs&lt;/a&gt; five miles three times a week and incorporating push-ups and pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical day of eating for Fremont begins with oatmeal, syrup, and blueberries for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lunch consists of beans, while dinner includes broccoli florets topped with ketchup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data from JAMA Surgery showed colon cancer is expected to rise by 90 percent in people ages 20 to 34 by 2030&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont also lives a low-stress lifestyle, using exercise as a form of emotional release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also does not drink or smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His healthy lifestyle has been shown to prevent cancer and its recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a structured exercise program for stage II and III colon cancer patients reduced recurrence by 28 percent, lowered mortality risk by 37 percent over eight years, and showed benefits with just 1.5 to 2.25 hours of brisk walking weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Focusing on whole, unprocessed plant foods increases the amount of beneficial nutrients and compounds taken in that help reduce inflammation, a key factor in cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, these dietary choices can support healthy weight, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control, all of which contribute to a lower cancer risk &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there is no concrete evidence diet alone can reverse cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	They may be smaller than their refillable counterparts, but some disposable e-&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/cigarettes/" id="auto-tag_cigarettes" data-tag="cigarettes"&gt;cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; actually emit more toxic metals than older vapes and traditional cigarettes, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Davis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Disposable e-cigarettes are the newest nicotine delivery systems on the market, and the most popular — particularly among adolescents, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7335a3.htm?s_cid=mm7335a3_w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;reported in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike traditional vapes, which are refilled with pods, disposable e-cigarettes come pre-filled and are discarded after use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	E-cigarettes are made up of metal coils and other metallic components that are in constant contact with e-liquid solution, which contains nicotine salt, flavorings, and organic acids. When nicotine salts are introduced into the e-liquid, and it is heated, it causes metal to dissolve. So when a smoker takes a puff, they’re inhaling aerosolized toxic metals as well as nicotine.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“We’ve known for a long time that when you heat a coil [in an e-cigarette] and it goes through the heat cycle, it will leach metals over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.etox.ucdavis.edu/people/brett-poulin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Brett Poulin, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology and senior author of the study. “People have documented that in a lot of different electronic cigarettes. But the unique part of this study is that we found elements in what we call the ‘virgin e-liquid,’ meaning that the device has never been used.” 

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	This design is known as a “closed system,” so you’re not changing out the coil, which Poulin says was a common feature of the previous-generation devices, and may help explain why the newer disposable e-cigarettes are more harmful. “And so when you have a closed system, you essentially just end up accumulating a lot of those metals over time, and you end up with higher concentrations in the aerosol that people breathe,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone.&lt;/em&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Additionally, the researchers found that disposable e-cigarettes contained antimony — a toxic metalloid — which wasn’t previously seen in older generations of e-cigarettes. “We identified [antimony] at high concentrations in the unused e-liquids of these devices,” says Mark Salazar, a PhD candidate in Poulin’s lab. “And we found that as the devices are aged and they’re puffed more and more, you’re producing more and more toxic antimony over time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So why are components that leach toxic metals being used in disposable e-cigarettes? “We can only speculate,” Poulin says, “but because they’re not reused, disposable e-cigarettes are only designed to be used through their life cycle, which can be anywhere between between 500 to several thousand puffs. You end up with a lot of cheap components, like a lead-based alloy.” He says it’s unclear why manufacturers are using these lower-quality parts, but says “it could be that there’s incentive to make cheaper products, and so they’re using materials that are cheaper in them, instead of something like stainless steel or a higher-quality metallic component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The researchers tested flavored and “clear” versions of three of the most popular products — Esco Bar, Flum Pebble, and ELF Bar — and found “excessive emissions of toxic metallic elements” in the aerosols from each of them. Currently, there are nearly 100 disposable e-cigarette brands on the market, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://digitalmedia.hhs.gov/tobacco/hosted/E-Cigarettes-Authorized-FDA-JAN2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;only authorized&lt;/a&gt; four products: NJOY DAILY Rich Tobacco (4.5 percent and 6 percent) and NJOY DAILY EXTRA Menthol (4.5 percent and 6 percent). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The manufacturers of Flum Pebble and Elf Bar did not immediately respond to our request for comment. A spokesperson for Eco Bar sent &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; the following statement: “The test that was conducted was not on an original EscoBar vape. It’s important for the researcher to understand that the market is flooded with counterfeit products from China. These fake vapes are typically untested and uncertified, and they are the ones that often show such irregularities. All of our vapes are lab-tested and fully approved.”

	&lt;/p&gt;

	To assess whether the concentrations of toxic metals in these three disposable e-cigarettes would be of concern for human &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/health/" id="auto-tag_health" data-tag="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, Salazar did a risk assessment based on an estimate of how much people typically use these devices, using 100 puffs per day as a benchmark — which Poulin says is “actually pretty conservative based on known use patterns.” From there, you can figure out how much toxic metal a smoker was exposed to. Lead, nickel, and antimony were all above the threshold of being safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To help put things in perspective, the researchers compared the health risks of disposable e-cigarettes to other types of smoking, and found that Esco Bar devices released more lead during a day’s use than 19 packs of traditional cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	What does this mean for disposable e-cigarette smokers’ health? “Nickel and antimony are respiratory carcinogens, so they can be essentially driving not just inflammation of the lungs, but also cancer,” Poulin says. “Lead is a potent neurotoxin, and our concern is that [disposable e-cigarettes] are often flavored devices, and they’re marketed towards youth. The concern is that adolescents and teens could be exposed to high levels of lead at a time when their neurological systems are developing.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Smoking disposable e-cigarettes may also cause lung fibrosis, Salazar says, but that would likely happen further down the line. “These disposables have only been on the market for maybe about five, six years, and a lot of these diseases take years — maybe decades — to manifest,” he explains. “So we’re not entirely sure what the long-term effects are going to be, but from the data that we have presented, we see that there is potential for concern here.”&lt;/p&gt;
