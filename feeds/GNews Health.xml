Different types of Vibrio bacteria cause different infections, with Vibrio vulnificus causing the "most serious forms of vibriosis," according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The potentially fatal infection can quickly result in tissue damage and spreading blisters, low blood pressure, fever, organ damage, sepsis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is often referred to as "flesh-eating" because it can also cause necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that destroys muscle and skin tissue, causing flesh around wounds to die, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt; While it is possible, Vibrio vulnificus is not considered to be the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bacteria and resulting infections are rare but can be life-threatening. Without treatment, death can occur in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How does 'flesh-eating' bacteria enter the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus requires salt water for survival and thrives in warm, brackish water where a stream or river meets seawater, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pre-protect-wounds-from-coastal-waters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most infections occur when contaminated water is swallowed or gets into an open wound, such as a cut or scrape. It can enter through broken skin but cannot penetrate unharmed skin. Vibrio vulnificus can also enter your body when you eat uncooked or undercooked shellfish, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/vibrio-and-oysters.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:especially oysters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;especially oysters&lt;/a&gt;.

That is, until a relatively mild illness spiraled into a near-death experience and left their son with lifelong health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In December 2023, Nicholas’ parents took him to Methodist Southlake Medical Center first for a relatively mild sickness and then again for a much more severe illness. The family alleges that the medical providers for that second visit ignored the boy’s obvious signs of medical distress, sending him home when he should’ve been admitted. As a result, the family says, Nicholas nearly died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Business Briefing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Become a business insider with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For more than a year and a half now, Nicholas and his parents have been coping with the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N.

He’s spent much of this summer at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the family recently learned that Nicholas’ heart isn’t functioning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And the family believes it all could’ve been prevented. As they juggle ongoing medical care, they’ve also set off on a quest for accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with federal regulators, who then issued a violation notice to the hospital. The family also recently refiled a lawsuit against the Southlake hospital, naming the hospital itself, Dr. Teresa Proietti and the physicians group Emergency Medicine Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Proietti did not respond to phone calls to her office. In a succinct legal filing, the doctor denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;A spokesperson for the Methodist Health System said in an email that the system does not comment on pending litigation. A spokesperson for Emergency Medicine Consultants similarly declined to comment on active litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;At the end of July, however, Methodist Health System submitted legal filings to the court, saying the lawsuit’s assertions are vague and not sufficiently supported by the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the filing, the health system also wrote that it is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. The events of December 2023 were “wholly and completely unavoidable and without any negligence on the part of” the hospital, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The flurry of activity in the wake of Nicholas’ near-death experience is a testament to the amount of attention one family can garner, when they have the time and resources to dedicate. But they know not every family would be able to put the same energy and money into the cause — and, to Selph, that’s enough reason in itself to keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;The timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It started with what seemed to be a case of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-December 2023, Nicholas was a fifth grader at Liberty Christian School in Argyle. The school sent him home sick, and Selph then took him to get medical care at Methodist Southlake. The hospital’s providers gave Nicholas an IV and sent him home to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For a while, it seemed like he was getting better. By the 22nd, though, Nicholas had gone downhill. By the 23rd, Selph and Mata could barely get Nicholas to move around, so they took him back to Methodist Southlake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We were there for a little under two hours,” Selph said, “and they just said, ‘Hey, it’s viral. Go home. He’ll be fine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On Christmas morning, Nicholas was doing markedly worse, Selph said. He could barely get out of bed. He wouldn’t eat. And Selph distinctly remembers that her son looked gray and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N.

Septic shock is an extreme response to an infection, and it can worsen rapidly as the body’s organs shut down. The condition has a high mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“They came in and they just said, ‘We don’t know how this is going to turn out. We’d like to bring in a priest for you,’” Selph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas had a weeklong stay in the ICU at Cook Children’s, punctuated by several invasive procedures including intubation. After the ICU, he spent another several weeks in the hospital before he was discharged. In total, he was hospitalized for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas survived, although Selph said there were long stretches where she thought he wouldn’t. Afterward, he had to relearn how to walk. And now, he has health complications that will likely be lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Importantly for Nicholas, some of the complications may also infringe on his ability to play football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is displayed at Mata’s home on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family believes the worst of the illness and the complications could’ve been avoided if Methodist Southlake providers had taken better care of Nicholas on his second visit to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Pushing for accountability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the months since Nicholas was discharged from the hospital, his family — and especially Selph — has searched for ways to hold Methodist Southlake and its providers responsible for what they see as medical malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid, even if the patient in question has other forms of health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-April 2024, according to a CMS document that Selph provided to &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt;, the federal agency found that the Southlake hospital had failed to meet standards of care in Nicholas’ case. The document does not specifically name Nicholas, but it describes the unnamed patient as an 11-year-old and describes the same medical situation. Selph also said the document does refer to her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, the federal notice says Methodist Southlake failed to provide a proper medical screening and “discharged Patient #1 with a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection despite Patient #1 having abnormal labs, elevated heart rate and decreased blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family also filed a civil lawsuit against the hospital in September, but dropped it in favor of pushing for legislative action during Texas’ 2025 session. Now that the session is over, the family has refiled that Tarrant County lawsuit against Methodist Southlake and the treating doctor, Proietti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;They argue the hospital and the medical team were negligent in their treatment of Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While a spokesperson for Methodist declined to comment, attorneys for the health system wrote in legal filings that the family’s claims are not supported by the evidence and that the hospital is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. Proietti wrote in a short legal filing at the beginning of August that she denies the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph is also pushing for repercussions from the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Board of Nursing, and she’s looking into possible criminal charges, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;All of these paths take time. Selph said it’s been an enormous amount of work to file and follow up with the various enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Shane Langston, the family’s attorney, said the case is strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve been doing this a long time,” Langston said, “and we don’t file a case like this, against medical providers, unless it’s legitimate and strongly supported by our medical specialists who reviewed the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;‘There’s got to be change’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;There are moments of the past year and a half that are seared into their memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph remembers when they got home from the hospital, after Nicholas was discharged, and all of their Christmas decorations were up. It was, by then, well over a month since the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The whole family struggled with the strong association they had between Christmas — a favorite holiday — and Nicholas’ near death. Nicholas’ dad, Antonio Mata, said that when he thinks back on how sick his son was that day, he’s washed with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“How could I miss what he was trying to tell us?” Mata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For their next Christmas, in 2024, Selph organized a wild departure from their usual rituals. They spent the day indoor skydiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“This past Christmas, we had a really tough time, because nobody wanted to be here,” Selph said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family doesn’t want anyone else to experience what they have experienced: the panic, the weeks at the hospital, the guilt, the rearranging of their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t want this to happen to someone else,” Selph said. “And if we can prevent just one person from going through this, that would be a win for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It could be months or years before their lawsuit is resolved, and the legal process can be both costly and time intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“But it’s worth it,” Mata said. “There’s got to be change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 11:01:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPSUFETk81Tjgyd2wwcVZXSHd4ZUZvTUJZVVNXODgwUnYxVDJ4MS1MY3JiQnJ3ejBHM0JMWnRlQjkwZmFaclFud2w1WThLSXJMWFNkZmc0VnhXRjVsSTZkV2ZiNEx5OEtybVlGNlN4NmRuSnFwUW5jYUFVclIyTlNKeXRQWTlIWmptc1Y3M1hJNV8tRV9HOGNIQ1ZrcEZULVZCNkNUM1BhZ2V3aFEtLWpyYW1SVDI0ZV9zT0M3VUJzZ01pek1mb3kzazVLT3JJcklKMmtaNVRFM29zdlp1Z1o5Nm9n</guid></item><item><title>扩大的结直肠癌筛查发现更多病例- Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbVF3T0l6eEV0WFM3RUw2QVBUb2VJZ01JUEdoQkJ5NWNrc3E1WDI2eExJTUdhNG9Lbl9xM2Z6OUllQ2F1Q3lwcnRydGEtV0RvVURZNWdRYXBERnNPMmY1eEdNVkFYZndBcVpYdGI2Q25JcUdHcDlFMWY5T29ab2k3SC1VRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 09:41:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbVF3T0l6eEV0WFM3RUw2QVBUb2VJZ01JUEdoQkJ5NWNrc3E1WDI2eExJTUdhNG9Lbl9xM2Z6OUllQ2F1Q3lwcnRydGEtV0RvVURZNWdRYXBERnNPMmY1eEdNVkFYZndBcVpYdGI2Q25JcUdHcDlFMWY5T29ab2k3SC1VRQ</guid></item><item><title>什么是北欧饮食？对你有好处吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbWJXcUZvWWZQZVpHdkNmeGtnck85N2k1Tk5MYmZnb3hnYk1LUVZHNjdXbTdNT256YVZmSXVHLW1qNVpwM0plREZ1OGJKaHZJT0ROamNRenQ3U1B6Mmt2UDBORkFHWlZOamVoamV4amRRN2Rkcy1nWjdncU1WN2xjeHZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 09:00:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbWJXcUZvWWZQZVpHdkNmeGtnck85N2k1Tk5MYmZnb3hnYk1LUVZHNjdXbTdNT256YVZmSXVHLW1qNVpwM0plREZ1OGJKaHZJT0ROamNRenQ3U1B6Mmt2UDBORkFHWlZOamVoamV4amRRN2Rkcy1nWjdncU1WN2xjeHZ3</guid></item><item><title>这种mRNA HIV疫苗产生的抗病毒抗体已躲避研究人员40年- ZME Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxNUTlMZVZFS0QwYUVzSVN1dHNWWk1wcFFkUWI5UHIwdTBMamQ2bUY3RjRZUTIzS2hMZHN6ZnFXRUluQU9uZUpLallqTVp3RDdtSG5mbWRDc2pDUy01cWFpQXdCblFLQkd2VERNZ3NzblNlRVJYOC1iaDFfa2plUE1mU1JVbGFRRDRUYThWSXBadHItREs3Qy1Gb0tJdktDRUl2R3RPT1AwcWhRNnRVRGRRNEw0OF9VZ3JkT1VoSEVvbmtYYmZRWjl3LTR1UDRJYVc3bmtSTkNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;In a small trial across ten U.S. research sites, a novel HIV vaccine candidate has shown a result that has eluded scientists for four decades: it reliably produced potent, virus-blocking antibodies in most participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work, published last week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady6831"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, tested three experimental vaccines built with the same mRNA technology used in COVID-19 shots but with a crucial twist. Instead of encoding HIV’s outer protein in its free-floating form, two of the vaccines instructed cells to make a “membrane-anchored” version, mimicking how the protein appears on the actual virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That one subtle change made a striking difference. After three doses, 80% of volunteers who received a membrane-bound version produced “tier 2” neutralizing antibodies. This is a benchmark that suggests good protection against the virus. Meanwhile, in the group that received the traditional soluble form, only 4% did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The difference is pretty striking,” Sharon Lewin, head of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, who was not involved in the research, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02439-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “These are the first studies, so they’re very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-an-hiv-vaccine-so-hard-to-make"&gt;Why is an HIV vaccine so hard to make&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1983, HIV has proven uniquely slippery. The virus wears a dense coat of sugars, shielding key targets from antibodies, and mutates so rapidly that even an &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/measles-doesnt-just-make-you-sick-it-resets-your-immune-system/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2558"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; that manages to block one strain is often powerless against the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, most vaccine candidates have targeted the “envelope trimer”—a three-pronged protein that HIV uses to latch onto immune cells. In reality, much of the trimer’s base is hidden against the viral membrane. Soluble protein vaccines, however, expose that base. This, in turn, prompts the body to make antibodies that bind there. But these antibodies can’t stop the actual infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach, developed by William Schief and colleagues at Scripps Research and Moderna, anchors the protein to cell membranes. That way, the immune system learns to recognize more vulnerable, real-world parts of the virus and can effectively eliminate the virus&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 100 HIV vaccine trials have been undertaken over the years. But this one seemed particularly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/animal-cruelty-free-testing-methods-will-tested-u-s-food-drug-administration/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2560"&gt;Animal tests&lt;/a&gt; hinted that such vaccines might work better. The new trial, involving humans, confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-trial-found"&gt;What the Trial Found&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 108 healthy adults aged 18 to 55. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three vaccines: the soluble trimer, a membrane-bound trimer, or a membrane-bound version with a mutation to block CD4 receptor binding. Each group received either a low (100 μg) or high (250 μg) dose, three times over six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests on volunteers’ blood showed that the membrane-bound vaccines spurred a stronger immune reaction than the traditional approach. They also seemed to “train” the immune system to focus less on parts of the virus that don’t help much in stopping infection, and more on its weak spots—regions known as V1/V3 and C3/V5—that are more likely to block HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vaccines also built up a stockpile of memory B cells, which act like long-term sentries, and activated specialized T cells, which help coordinate the body’s entire immune defense. The entire body’s immune system mobilized for the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there were limits. The antibodies produced were “autologous.” They recognized the particular virus strain the vaccine had, but not the many other HIV strains circulating worldwide. The ultimate goal is to elicit &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/vaccine-hiv-passes-phase-one-trial-23637533/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2557"&gt;broadly neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (bnAbs), which can target conserved sites across diverse strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-750x498.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1140x757.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-750x498.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-288130 sp-no-webp" alt="Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 budding (in green) from cultured lymphocyte" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 budding (in green) from a cultured lymphocyte. Credit: Wikimedia Commons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The side effects were significant, but not truly threatening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven participants — about 6.5 percent — developed hives, or urticaria, after vaccination. In five cases, the condition became chronic, lasting more than six weeks; in some, symptoms persisted for years. The reaction occurred across all three vaccine types, at both doses, and has not been seen in &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/finally-mrna-vaccines-against-cancer-are-starting-to-become-a-reality/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2559"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a scientific mystery at the moment,” Schief told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2490444-human-trials-point-the-way-towards-an-mrna-vaccine-against-hiv/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that something about the combination of HIV proteins and the mRNA delivery platform triggers the effect, but they have yet to pinpoint the cause. Future trials will test lower doses in hopes of reducing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-we-actually-make-an-hiv-vaccine"&gt;Can we actually make an HIV vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite all the unknown variables, the study is a milestone. Only two other mRNA HIV vaccine trials have ever reached human testing, and none until now have shown such a high rate of neutralizing antibody production. It’s truly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the technology’s speed and flexibility brought by mRNA (which allows new designs built in just months) can accelerate the long, trial-and-error process of training the immune system to fight HIV. In the future, scientists could program a single mRNA shot to release a full sequence of priming and boosting proteins in timed waves, replacing months or even years of repeated clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s far from a solved problem. First, studies with a greater sample size need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Then, researchers need to find a way to make the vaccine effective against multiple strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a worthy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the best current HIV prevention tools, such as the twice-yearly injectable drug lenacapavir, require ongoing use and access to healthcare. A durable, widely protective vaccine would be transformative, especially in low-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;

In parts of the city, they are even flying drones to detect sources of stagnant water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some neighbouring cities had ordered travellers from Foshan to undergo a 14-day home quarantine, but that has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some people have compared these measures to those imposed during the pandemic, and questioned their necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A user on Weibo wrote, "These feel so familiar... But are they really necessary?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another wrote: "What's the point of the quarantine? It's not as though an infected patient will then go around biting other people?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;China implemented severe restrictions during the pandemic, including forcing people into quarantine camps and sealing residential buildings and whole neighbourhoods on short notice for days or even weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;What is chikungunya?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most people bitten by an infected mosquito will develop symptoms of chikungunya within three to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Apart from fever and joint pain, other symptoms include rash, headache, muscle pain and swollen joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In severe cases however, the joint pain can last for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those at risk for more severe disease include newborns, the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is no cure, but deaths from chikungunya are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The virus was first identified in Tanzania in 1952.

   &lt;p&gt;It's no secret that stress isn't good for you. But just how bad is it? Well, in the last few decades, scientists have linked psychological stress to changes in our DNA that look a lot like what happens on the molecular level as we age. Today on the show, host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G.

&lt;p&gt;Strength, mobility and flexibility are three attributes that typically fade as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But act now, and you can slow this biological aging process in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? According to experienced Pilates teacher Brett Starkowitz it’s by lifting weights to build muscle and regularly mobilizing your body to stay limber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the head of education and master trainer at London’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health &amp;amp; Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, Starkowitz is a vocal advocate of incorporating Pilates into your weekly workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a good complementary form of exercise to anything else you’re doing,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re weightlifting, it’ll make your weightlifting better. If you’re running, it’ll make your running better. It’ll make everyday activities better, because you’re learning to use your body better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you can’t get to a Pilates studio and Reformer Pilates isn’t an option, Starkowitz has a four-move solution that he uses daily to keep his mobility and flexibility topped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to keep introducing mobility drills into your day,” he says. “I’ve always done weightlifting and weight-bearing exercise, but I’ve started spending a lot more time on mobility, because you lose that as you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hZHby6FSBRCjmC7bsZ936W" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hZHby6FSBRCjmC7bsZ936W slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 43-year-old says he refined this routine in his 30s, “because when you’re in your 20s you can just jump into the gym and go, but not so much anymore.” He now uses it after every workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need is your bodyweight to get started. You can perform it after your workouts, like Starkowitz does, or as a standalone mobility routine whenever you need to loosen up your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-boost-your-mobility-with-these-four-pilates-inspired-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Boost your mobility with these four Pilates-inspired exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starkowitz’s routine involves four Pilates-inspired stretches that will help unlock the most common pain points: the spine, the hips, the back of the legs, and the chest and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with a cat-cow stretch to gently articulate each vertebrae of the spine, then moves onto a deep hip flexor stretch, a downward-facing dog to lengthen the back body and child’s pose to release the lats and traps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older you need to be mindful of dedicating a bit more time to warming up and mobility work and stretching,” he says. So take your time, enjoy each stretch and your future self will thank you later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-cat-cow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1 Cat-cow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieDjs4PG74Agcvy6BUmfCa/GettyImages-1351466718.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieDjs4PG74Agcvy6BUmfCa/GettyImages-1351466718.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / tapui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin on your hands and knees with your shoulders over your wrists and your hips over your knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale as you arch your back, lifting your head and tailbone (this is cow pose).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale as you round your spine, tucking your chin into your chest and your tailbone under (this is cat pose).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move slowly between the two poses, syncing your breath with each movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform 8-10 slow cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-hip-flexor-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2 Hip flexor lunge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7d95X2UUbUWhSQgzUbBJT/hip-flexor-stretch-GettyImages-2139314022.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7d95X2UUbUWhSQgzUbBJT/hip-flexor-stretch-GettyImages-2139314022.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / DragonImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From kneeling, step one leg forward into the top of a lunge position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuck your tailbone under slightly and lightly engage your glutes to protect your lower back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your hands on your hips, gently ease your body forward to deepen the stretch into the hip flexor and quads on the rear leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform two sets of 20-30 seconds per side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-downward-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3 Downward dog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGSL78ku3uGft3uC9Ti3Bn/GettyImages-1483867092.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGSL78ku3uGft3uC9Ti3Bn/GettyImages-1483867092.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / PeopleImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on all fours, tuck your toes, and lift your hips up and back to form an inverted V-shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your spine long and legs as straight as comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spread your fingers wide and press your heels toward the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Option to pedal your feet, gently pressing one heel then the other toward the floor to loosen your calves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 30 seconds, returning your knees to the floor between each set.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-child-s-pose"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4 Child’s pose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6VDRxive6ygRaKZWb26xB/childs-pose-GettyImages-1483933220.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6VDRxive6ygRaKZWb26xB/childs-pose-GettyImages-1483933220.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / PeopleImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on all fours with your knees wide and feet close together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit back onto your feet as far as you comfortably can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your chin tucked into your chest, reach your hands forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Option to raise your hands so only your fingertips are in contact with the floor and press your chest further into the floor to stretch your pecs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, shuffle your hands to one side to stretch the side of your back, then over to the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for two sets of 30 seconds, or one set of 30 seconds each side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The speed of your steps could make a significant difference in adding years to your life, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Vanderbilt University in the US analyzed the physical activity of 79,856 adults in 12 US states, comparing links between time spent walking slowly, time spent walking quickly, and eventual &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/leading-cause-of-death-in-us-claims-a-life-every-34-seconds"&gt;cause of death&lt;/a&gt; (where applicable) across an average follow-up period of almost 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that those people who spent at least a quarter of an hour each day walking briskly were significantly less likely to die during the study period, especially from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings particularly useful is they're based on a sample that includes people typically underrepresented in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-walking-style-can-have-surprising-health-benefits-study-says"&gt;walking studies like this&lt;/a&gt;: the cohort was predominantly made up of low-income and Black individuals, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-017-0469-5"&gt;who are often&lt;/a&gt; more likely to live in impoverished areas and less likely to have access to safe walking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;Supercharge Your Daily Walk With These 5 Simple Changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research has shown that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day was associated with a nearly 20 percent reduction in total mortality, while a smaller reduction in mortality was found in association with more than three hours of daily slow walking," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Wei Zheng, from Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This benefit remained strong even after accounting for other lifestyle factors and was consistent across various sensitivity analyses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169611" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169611" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk.jpg" alt="Walking and cardiovascular disease risk" class="wp-image-169611 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk-600x340.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169611" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Slow walking and fast walking, with associated risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

To qualify for the faster walking linked to the reduction in the risk of death, it had to be something like climbing stairs or walking briskly as part of an exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study isn't comprehensive enough to show direct cause and effect, the drop in mortality risk is significant enough to strongly suggest some kind of link, and the researchers think the benefits that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; brings to heart health is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking makes the heart work harder, improving cardiovascular health. Burning calories can also help people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;stick to a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the health benefits of daily walking are well established, limited research has investigated the effects of factors such as walking pace on mortality, particularly in low-income and Black/African-American populations," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;researchers are so keen&lt;/a&gt; to promote walking as a way of staying healthy is that it's just about the simplest exercise out there: most of us can do it, without any special equipment, and it's relatively easy to roll into a daily routine (try parking a little further away from work, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health campaigns and community-based programs can emphasize the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes, providing resources and support to facilitate increased fast walking within all communities," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Lili Liu, from Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like 100 million Americans, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-5e06b4d0-6cdf-11f0-8362-91360a9136f9"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; grandmother-of-two was prediabetic and about 30 pounds overweight. Combined with family history, she had three of the most &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14599453/harvard-experts-overlooked-risk-factors-dementia-preventable.html"&gt;common risk factors for dementia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just a few miles away, Patty Kelly cared for her mother for 'a very painful seven years' while she, too, battled dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The hardest time to me was when my two sons came to visit her, and she looked up at them and had no idea who they were. They were in their 30s at the time, and they walked out of the room crying,' Kelly, now 81, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At that point it was like, "How can I make sure they don't go through that with me?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an effort to break the cycle, Jones and Kelly took part in the US POINTER trial, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;the country's most comprehensive study&lt;/a&gt; showing simple lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can stave off cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, unveiled this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in Toronto, showed people who followed a strict routine of aerobic and strength exercises, kept to a careful diet and formed social connections for two years had improved cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Phyllis Jones (left) and Patty Kelly (right) both participated in the groundbreaking US POINTER trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also slowed their brains' aging by one to two years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both women told the Daily Mail they lost weight, lowered their cholesterol and improved their mental health since starting the first-of-its-kind study, and they plan to continue following the routines they created in an effort to ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also believe they may have broken their families' generational curses and changed the predetermined paths toward dementia they were on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Finding out about the US POINTER study was one of the best things that could have happened to me,' Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm forever grateful.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rachel Whitmer, study co-author and chief in the division of epidemiology at the University of California, Davis, told the Daily Mail that attracting subjects 'was a tall order'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're recruiting people who don't have a healthy lifestyle, but have a family history,' Dr Whitmer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though they don't already have a healthy lifestyle, they're willing to come in here and make a change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About two in five Americans over the age of 55 years will eventually develop dementia, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 514,000 Americans are currently diagnosed with dementia every year, a figure that is expected to double to 1 million by 2060. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the estimated 7.2 million people currently living with dementia, the vast majority have Alzheimer's disease, &lt;span&gt;a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory, thinking skills and even the ability to carry out simple day to day tasks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US POINTER was inspired by a Finnish study first released a decade ago called FINGER. Like POINTER, the study enrolled 1,260 older adults who all had risk factors for dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FINGER study found people who followed the lifestyle interventions had 25 percent improvement in overall cognitive function compared to the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We needed to figure out a way to do it here,' Dr Whitmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US POINTER study enrolled 2,111 adults from five sites across the US and followed them for two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows changes in cognitive scores over time among people who implemented structured changes and those who implemented self-guided ones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 'structured' group followed a strict exercise and diet plan and had regular meetings with other members of their 'teams' and their doctors to track their progress. The other 'self-guided' group made their own changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the trial sites was Chicago, where Jones and Kelly met in 2022 as members of the structured group.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite never meeting previously, the women turned out to live within five miles of each other in the Chicago suburbs. They started going to their local Y for Silver Sneakers exercise classes designed for seniors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones said she had 'trouble making it through the first 30 minutes' of the group classes when she first started out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the beginning of the study, Jones tried a variety of muscle strengthening classes like barre and yoga but had to wear braces on her knees, ankles and back to support her weak joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't need any of that stuff now,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones also noticed she went from staring at the clock during a workout and waiting for it to be over to time flying by, especially when she exercises with her VR headset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Kelly would frequently take walks around her neighborhood, she had never focused brisk walking, which raises heart rate over time and improves fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The POINTER team showed her how to gradually increase her pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was big for me,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows dementia risk divided by geographic region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also advised to follow a 'MIND' diet, which combines tenets of the Mediterranean and DASH (dietary approaches to stopping hypertension) diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's been shown to lower dementia risk by emphasizing brain-healthy foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, olive oil, lean fish and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, participants were given questionnaires on their dietary habits and assigned a score from zero to 14, with higher scores indicating a more brain-healthy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly initially scored a five, which she later found out 'was one of the worst scores possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after two years, the MIND diet 'is like a Bible to me now,' Kelly said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, she scored 13.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She still keeps the chart of recommended foods on her fridge and makes copies when she travels. Even when she arrived at AAIC as part of the POINTER reveal, she had a copy of the diet in her luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me the big thing was the MIND diet and how it helped me, you know,' Kelly told the Daily Mail. 'I saw my cholesterol go down, so that was so exciting for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rachel Whitmer (pictured), study co-author and chief in the Division of Epidemiology at the University of California, Davis told the Daily Mail that US POINTER was the 'hardest' but 'most rewarding' study she has been part of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Phyllis Jones (pictured) said US POINTER helped her lose 30 pounds and reversed her prediabetes, lowering her risk of developing dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also asked to complete 'Brain HQ' cognitive exercises several times per week, which have helped Kelly feel more confident with driving. For the first time in years, her two sons will ride in the car with her instead of insisting on driving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the study, Jones has lost 30 pounds, and 11 inches off of her waistline. She's also no longer prediabetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her family has now adopted her new habits: Her son and daughter have both made adjustments to their diets, and Jones' 7-year-old granddaughter even insists on having a salad with her school lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're picking up all these habits and all of these changes that I'm bringing,' Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and Kelly both told the Daily Mail building up the changes they made slowly helped keep them motivated and prevented them from quitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Whitmer agrees, saying, 'What I also love about the study is we didn't have everyone do everything right away - we built up. We didn't want them to quit. Getting people to change their behavior is the hardest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the reason why it worked and people stayed in it was that it was like a gradual ramp up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones and Kelly became friends throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones said Kelly is 'my inspiration - this is how I want to be when I'm 81.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they aren't the only participants to form a newfound bond. Dr Whitmer also noted at least one couple got married during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think it's great that people can hold each other accountable,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The POINTER team plans to observe the participants for another four years and publish additional studies looking at the reasons behind the improvements. They also plan to expand to 10 additional sites across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been doing this research for 26 years. This was the hardest study to ever do, but the most rewarding,' Dr Whitmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can't modify family history, but you can modify some of these risk factors and the way that you live.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and soy protein to reduce your cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts also recommend talking with your provider about plant sterols and psyllium husks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking and reducing saturated fat in your diet, can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol affects about 10% of adults living in the U.S., but experts estimate that many more have high cholesterol levels and have no idea. High cholesterol is silent—the only way to tell if you have elevated numbers ( ≥240 mg/dL of total cholesterol) is by getting a simple blood test.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to know if your cholesterol is high because hypercholesterolemia increases your risk for other conditions, like atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in your arteries that can lead to a heart attack and/or stroke. While there are certain risk factors, like your age and genetics, that you can’t control, there are other factors, like your diet and lifestyle, that you can.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

But there are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009984/supplements-you-should-consider-taking/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;science-supported supplements&lt;/a&gt; that may also lend support in managing your cholesterol levels. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LDN, CLEC,&lt;/a&gt; shares, “A balanced diet is the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-thing-to-limit-to-lower-cholesterol-11783649" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;foundation for managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, while supplements act as a helpful safety net to fill in any gaps.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitians agree that these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-your-40s-11777210" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;four supplements&lt;/a&gt; may be worth considering if you’ve done everything you can to manage your cholesterol levels and still aren’t seeing the numbers you’d like. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A meta-analysis of 90 randomized controlled studies found a dose-response relationship of supplementing with these fats and improved blood lipids. Both DHA and EPA helped &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/underrated-food-to-buy-at-costco-to-lower-triglycerides-according-to-a-cardiologist-8787040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;lower both triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; and non-HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Note, triglycerides aren’t cholesterol; they’re a different lipid. Having &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lower-triglycerides-mistakes-11742759" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;high triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; means you’re more likely to have high cholesterol, placing you at higher risk for heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you can get &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DHA and EPA through food sources&lt;/a&gt;, like salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel, most Americans are falling short on including them in their diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enter the supplement safety net. &lt;a href="http://www.tobyamidornutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, shares, “Most people aren’t getting enough DHA and EPA omega-3 fats. That’s where a supplement can be helpful. In fact, research found that taking more than 2 grams per day of a DHA and EPA combined supplement can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;help lower blood lipids&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-plant-sterols"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Plant Sterols  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant sterols are compounds found in plants that have a similar structure to cholesterol. Because of this, plant sterols can help block cholesterol absorption in the gut, which in turn helps keep blood cholesterol levels in check. Manaker shares, “Plant sterols work by competing with cholesterol for absorption in the digestive system. This means &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/portfolio-diet-can-lower-cholesterol-research-shows-8399518" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less cholesterol gets absorbed&lt;/a&gt; into your bloodstream, which can help lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels without affecting HDL ("good") cholesterol.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A meta-analysis explored a variety of nutraceuticals, including plant sterols, and the impact they had on blood lipid levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While research designs are challenging to do on humans with this particular supplement, the body of research continues to support the inclusion of plant sterols as part of an intervention designed to lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine also notes that plant sterol supplements have shown promise in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-weekly-to-lower-high-cholesterol-11703900" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; when taken with meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While they are overall safe and pose minimal risk, individuals with specific genetic conditions may be at an increased risk of heart disease when the supplement is consumed in excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Psyllium Husk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This popular &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt; has made a name for itself in weight loss, cholesterol management and blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Amidor recommends this supplement for cholesterol management, given its longstanding research in the area. In fact, a review highlights the cholesterol-lowering effects this supplement has on humans. Notably, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplement-to-poop-11762356" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber in psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; helps lower LDL cholesterol levels through binding to bile acids in the intestines. This helps remove them from the body, which in turn lowers cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there are some downsides to this supplement, like its interaction with other medications and ability to hinder absorption of other nutrients and calories from foods, it’s best to work with your provider to identify the dosage that may be best for you.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-soy-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Soy Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy protein has been shown to have a positive impact on cholesterol levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis explored the impact that soy protein supplementation had on postmenopausal women and their cholesterol levels. Scientists found soy protein supplementation demonstrated a significant impact on cholesterol levels, noting a reduction of total cholesterol levels and an increase of HDL cholesterol levels (the “good” cholesterol).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Manaker shares that soy protein’s impact on cholesterol levels is due to its ability to “reduce the liver’s production of cholesterol and increase the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One important point when it comes to soy protein supplementation is that the research shows &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7969228/is-soy-bad-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;food sources of soy protein&lt;/a&gt; yield better results than a pill form of soy protein, likely due to the other nutrients found in soy products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Manaker recommends considering more tofu, soy milk, edamame and soy protein powders in your diet to start. The good news, too, is that there is little risk associated with consuming more soy protein in your diet (unless you have a soy protein allergy).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-support-cholesterol-levels"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Support Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While supplements can be used as a safety net, they are not a replacement for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet or lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; that have proven to support cholesterol levels. Amidor and Manaker recommend considering these other strategies to support healthy cholesterol levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit saturated fat. &lt;/strong&gt;Saturated fat can raise LDL cholesterol levels, impacting your heart health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming no more than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make smarter choices, choose lean and extra-lean cuts of meat and trim visible fat off your meat when preparing it. Reducing consumption of cheese, full-fat dairy and processed meats is also a great way to reduce saturated fat in your diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more fruits and vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Filled with fiber and antioxidants, fruits and vegetables help improve diet quality and lower one’s risk of chronic disease. Yet, only 10% of people in the U.S. eat the recommended daily fruits and veggies. Make a conscious effort to add one serving of either a fruit or veggie at every meal and snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy fatty fish (like salmon) twice per week. &lt;/strong&gt;Up your intakes of those omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA by consuming fatty fish at least twice per week. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/21611/ingredients/fish-seafood/fish/salmon/canned/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Enlisting the help of canned salmon &lt;/a&gt;is an excellent dietitian-approved swap to make mealtime magic happen with these fish. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose foods with the American Heart Association’s Heart Check Mark. &lt;/strong&gt;An easy way to navigate the market is by looking for foods with the heart-check logo. This means items have been vetted by the American Heart Association and have lower fat, sodium and added sugar than other items. But, as with all foods, even a heart-check approved snack food should still be consumed in moderation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly. &lt;/strong&gt;Regular movement is an excellent way to improve cholesterol levels and can help manage stress levels (another factor that can indirectly affect your lipid levels). In fact, research shows that moderate and high-intensity movement improves HDL cholesterol levels (the good one).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting small with a walking routine is a wonderful way to invite more movement into your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking and vaping, and limit alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Smoking and drinking both increase one’s cholesterol levels. Quitting smoking is a great idea if you have high cholesterol. Alcohol is a known carcinogen and should be reduced. If the thought of giving it up stresses you out more, stick to standard serving sizes when you do enjoy a glass of wine (which is a 5-ounce pour).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition and lifestyle play a critical role in managing high cholesterol levels. But there are four supplements that may offer some benefits, too. For example, nutrition experts recommend adding the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, as well as soy protein, into your regular routine. Talk with your provider if you want to consider adding psyllium husk or plant sterols as part of your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-cholesterol-diet-plan-11779198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering plan&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty-eight people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease since July 25, 2025 and two people have died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have been in the affected area since late July  who have flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 4, 2025 — &lt;/strong&gt;Today, the NYC Health Department provided an update on the investigation into a community cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem (ZIP codes 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037, and 10039) and bordering communities. Fifty-eight people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease since July 25, 2025 and two people have died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remediation required by the Department has been completed for the 11 cooling towers with initial positive screening results showing the presence of &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;, a type of bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People living or working in the area with flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, chills, muscle aches, or difficulty breathing should contact a health care provider immediately. It is especially important for people at higher risk — including those ages 50 and older, cigarette smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems — to get care if they have symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible," said &lt;strong&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse&lt;/strong&gt;. "Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, which grows in warm water. People can get Legionnaires’ disease by breathing in water vapor that contains Legionella bacteria. Legionnaires’ disease cannot be transmitted from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics. Complications from the disease are less likely the earlier treatment begins. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for &lt;em&gt;Legionella growth&lt;/em&gt;, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems. &lt;/p&gt;

But if retinoids aren’t for you, then &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vitamin-c-guide-skin-benefits-concentration-absorption" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; has also been proven to support collagen synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of low collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brittle hair and nails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hair thinning or excessive hair shedding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of skin elasticity and crepey skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;At what age should one start focusing on increasing collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, from your mid-20s, as this is when collagen production in the skin and body begins to slow down. That’s not to say that starting in your 30s, 40s, or 50s is fruitless; it just means you may need to stay the course of collagen-stimulating treatments and products longer before you see results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Professional treatments to stimulate collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hands of a professional, collagen induction therapy includes treatments such as microneedling, radio frequency, and ultrasound skin tightening, as well as laser. “Ablative lasers burn tiny holes into the skin that have to heal, a process that prompts collagen production,” explains Craythorne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injectables also have a role to play, with some types of filler specifically designed to stimulate collagen production. These create an immediate plumping effect (filler is made up of hyaluronic acid molecules), but also encourage the body to produce more collagen naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biostimulatory fillers such as Radiesse (calcium hydroxylapatite) offer long-term collagen stimulation along with volume restoration, making them ideal for mature skin,” Shotter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRP therapy is another option and involves injecting “platelet-rich plasma derived from your own blood.” This accelerates tissue repair, enhances collagen production, and can be combined with microneedling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other lifestyle changes to support healthy collagen levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is key. “Your body needs vitamin C, zinc, manganese, and copper to produce collagen, so it’s important to have these in your diet,” Shotter explains. A &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;collagen-rich diet&lt;/a&gt; can pay dividends when it comes to skin health, too. Focus on foods like bone broth, salmon, and egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you get enough sleep and take steps to manage your stress levels. “This supports hormonal balance and skin regeneration,” says Dr Shin-Young Cho, Korean specialist dermatologist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://futurecaremedical.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://futurecaremedical.com/"}' href="https://futurecaremedical.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Future Care Medical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, dermatologists aren’t huge fans of using supplements to boost collagen stores, because there’s no conclusive evidence to show that collagen peptides actually make their way to the skin. Craythorne does, however, agree that they can improve skin hydration when taken regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY grid grid-even grid-items-2 GroupCalloutWrapper-cfrXZg

targeted areas of the skin. Here are some of the best skincare products for collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Retinol and Retinoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Retinoids, such as retinol, retinal, and doctor-prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-tretinoin" target="_blank"&gt;tretinoin&lt;/a&gt;—are the gold standard, directly stimulating fibroblasts to increase collagen production and improve skin texture over time,” Shotter explains. Not only that, but retinoids can help with skin elasticity restoration, improving firmness and rough or bumpy skin texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is another critical element in collagen synthesis and also “protects against oxidative damage,” says Shotter. “Peptides can signal to the skin to repair and rebuild collagen, though their effects are milder than retinoids, but they can be used synergistically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY grid grid-even grid-items-2

The untimely heart attack takes the lives of many without presenting any unmistakable symptoms in the wake of medical developments. But what if there were a simple blood test that could warn of a heart attack years before it would take place? The recent advances in cardiovascular diagnostics are trying to fulfil this dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of &lt;keyword id="23031116" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="predictive-biomarkers" source="keywords"&gt;predictive biomarkers&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists”, as Dumont et al. have demonstrated, “have found certain proteins and enzymes and inflammatory markers in blood which, if they appeared in higher than normal concentration, indicated that the person was at risk of cardiovascular disease long before any clinical presentation.” High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is one such marker. It signifies inflammation in the vessels of the heart-a silent trigger in most heart attacks. A protein blood test (genetic lipo/protein analysis) can predict heart attack risk by detecting elevated lipoprotein(a) levels linked to inherited cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troponin comes next on this list of probable biomarkers. Troponin is primarily used to identify heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troponin levels are elevated only a small amount, it has called to attention heart muscle stress or damage in the form of an early warning, years before. The other factor that has risen into prominence as a strong factor for early onset heart disease, especially in South Asians, is lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), a genetic form of cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unprecedented prospect for cardiovascular health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, where CVDs affect younger populations, it is very much important to go in for early intervention. With urban lifestyles, increasing sedentarism, and the rising stress level, the younger lot itself is under threat. But for most routine checks, no one does anything else beyond reading cholesterol and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a little bit more of a proactive approach involving cardiac biomarkers testing, risk individuals could be identified earlier, so that they could then eliminate risk through lifestyle modification, early treatment with medication, or further diagnostic evaluation if warranted. This testing can be simple, non-fasting blood tests , no guruji, no stress test, no invasive procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technology meets precision medicine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI biomarker data integration is giving the jewel more shine. Advanced AI modeling techniques can now analyze the patient profile, which could include blood test results, genetic data, and lifestyle risk factors, and arrive at an individualized estimate of one's 10-year or even lifetime risk of developing heart disease. This individualized prediction and risk stratification allows for targeted prevention, rather than generic public-health-based preventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A wake-up call for routine screening&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these breakthroughs, public awareness and access remain barriers. Don't wait and wait until you suddenly have a heart attack and need an operation. We must shift our mindset from “reactive treatment” to “proactive prevention.” Including advanced cardiac biomarkers in annual health checks could be the key to reducing India’s heart attack toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks don't just happen overnight, the silent damage increases over years. A basic blood check, administered at the right time, might provide a life-saving early alert. While science is arming us with tools, it’s up to us as individuals, as doctors, as policymakers to act now before it’s too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sameer Bhati Public Health Expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>克拉克马斯县居民在遇到受感染的蝙蝠后接受狂犬病治疗- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="22JBRC2XDBGPDI2MZIVP2NS3U4"&gt;Clackamas County health officials say a bat found in a Molalla home tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TU4KK74IQVBLTBCHCE3HKKAZKA"&gt;The bat was captured after it came into contact with a resident in the home.

Left untreated, the virus affects the central nervous system, and once symptoms appear, it is almost always fatal. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20is%20deadly,disease%20is%20nearly%20always%20fatal." target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, human fatalities are rare and typically occur in people who don’t get treatment quickly after a scratch or bite from an infected animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGEFK77B2NEFFMYHTP4TP7CH6Q"&gt;Over the past five years, the county has seen one bat per year that has tested positive for rabies, according to Dr. Sarah Present, Clackamas County’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UX3K24KQZJE4BEKM7F542EU3KQ"&gt;Health officials say the summer brings more encounters with bats — Oregon’s top rabies threat.

Trends show that people across the country are turning to stand-alone surgery and imaging centers to keep out-of-pocket costs low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Intermountain endoscopy center is already open in Sandy, on the Alta View Hospital campus, and the other two are planned near Riverton Hospital and at  McKay-Dee Hospital, in Ogden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three centers will provide colonoscopies and other endoscopy procedures to examine the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. These procedures can help address swallowing difficulties, abdominal pain, chronic bowel issues and hemorrhoids, as well as diagnose serious conditions like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis and/or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Digestive health is coming more to the forefront as Americans are paying more attention to healthy eating, nutrition, gut health and maintaining a healthy weight. Intermountain Health is helping patients be more proactive about their digestive health through comprehensive, team-based care with each patient," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health said offering endoscopy services in a lower-cost setting is a way the organization can meet its nonprofit mission to improve the overall health of the communities it serves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locations will be managed by Surgery Partners, a company that already operates multiple Intermountain Health surgery centers in Utah, in addition to locations in 29 other states. Merriman said the company's philosophy of providing high-quality and cost-effective solutions aligns with Intermountain Health's mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being one of the more preventable forms of cancer, colon cancer caused about 53,000 deaths in the United States last year, according to the American Cancer Society, which estimates more than 100,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonoscopy screening is recommended starting at age 45, or earlier for people with a family history of colon cancer. A colonoscopy does not require a referral for treatment at the Alta View Endoscopy Center, but upper endoscopy procedures will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vaccine skepticism in the U.S. kills more children outside the U.S. — because it transfers that skepticism — than it does inside the United States,” Gates said during a discussion at a STAT event in Cambridge, Mass., where he was speaking about a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/04/bill-gates-foundation-womens-maternal-health-funding-announcement/"&gt;$2.5 billion pledge to women’s health initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates, founder and head of the Gates Foundation, was asked by STAT’s Matthew Herper about the mounting debate in the United States — led by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — about what many vaccine experts believe are settled issues around vaccine safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A vaccine panel Kennedy appointed to advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/rfk-jr-new-acip-panel-bans-thimerosal-in-flu-shots-preservative-long-a-target-of-antivax-activists/"&gt;voted in late June&lt;/a&gt; to require all flu vaccine doses marketed in the U.S. to be free of thimerosal, a preservative that has a long safety record but that the anti-vaccine movement believes is harmful. More recently, Kennedy has taken public aim at &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/14/aluminum-in-vaccines-large-danish-study-finds-no-link-to-autism-asthma-allergies/"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; that found no evidence of an association between aluminum salts — used in some vaccines to boost the immune response they generate — and a range of conditions such as asthma and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates noted that in the developing world, where children’s underlying health status can be more tenuous than is the norm in the United States, measles infections can lead to a substantially higher death rate than is seen in richer countries.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He also noted that the Gates Foundation has been funding work on a combined polio, malaria, and measles vaccine, one that would be delivered via a patch rather than an injection. Underlying the work seems to be the hope that measles could be a target for eradication — effectively wiping the pathogen off the face of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only one human disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. The world has been struggling for nearly four decades to eradicate polio, with the Gates Foundation as the lead funder of that effort at this point. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles, too, could be a target for eradication, because the virus only infects people; it has no other animal reservoir. So if transmission among people could be stopped with high vaccination rates, the virus would die out. But growing resistance to measles vaccines, which many in the anti-vax movement blame for the rise in autism rates, could take that ambition off the table, Gates said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now we’re going to have to say, does rich country skepticism alone mean that we will not take on measles eradication?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the issue of polio eradication, Gates said he believes it can still be achieved. Only two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, have never managed to stop transmission of polio viruses. The two countries combined have reported &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wild-poliovirus-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; of paralytic polio so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked if he thought polio eradication was still worth the investment, Gates said to cease the effort would see a return to a situation where as many as 100,000 children would be paralyzed annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have a choice. You can stop spending that money and have polio spread back and have global health have a huge failure. You wouldn’t go back to the peak because as you improve sanitation in countries … so economic development slowly reduces that. So it won’t come back in big numbers to rich countries, but it will come back in gigantic numbers to Africa and Asia,” he suggested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates said he believes the goal is still reachable, but acknowledged the foundation’s substantial spending on the project could be coloring his views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you spend billions of dollars on something, maybe you’re biased towards hoping that it works,” he said. “But I think I’m being objective to say, no, this is money that we’re going to continue to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also expressed some hope that the massive aid funding cuts that the U.S. government instituted with the closing of the U.S. Agency for International Development may eventually be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do think that we’ll make the case for a lot of that funding to be restored; at least we’re going to do the best on that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Overdoing it on the booze is associated with a whole range &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;of problems&lt;/a&gt;, including premature death, heart disease, digestive issues, and &lt;a href="drinking-until-you-pass-out-linked-to-doubled-risk-of-dementia-giant-study-reveals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;an increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that pairing information about alcohol and cancer with a particular practical action – counting their drinks – resulted in drinkers reducing the amount of alcohol they consumed," &lt;a href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/media-releases/cancer-a-compelling-reason-to-cut-alcohol-and-drink-counting-helps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said economist and psychologist Simone Pettigrew&lt;/a&gt; from The George Institute for Global Health when the findings were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;This Is What Happens to Your Body When You Stop Drinking Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, three surveys were filled out: 7,995 people completed the first, 4,588 of those people completed the second three weeks later, and 2,687 people finished the final survey three weeks after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split up into different groups and shown different advertisements and messages about drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One combination stood out, compared to a control group: A TV ad linking booze and cancer, together with a suggestion to keep count of your drinks, was one of the most effective at getting people to try and cut down on alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_137378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137378" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/PeopleEatingDrinkingWine642.jpg" alt="Two young women eating pizza and drinking wine" class="size-full wp-image-137378" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/PeopleEatingDrinkingWine642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/PeopleEatingDrinkingWine642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/PeopleEatingDrinkingWine642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-137378" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers discovered an effective way to encourage people to drink less alcohol.

"It's important information that drinkers should have access to. But telling people alcohol causes cancer is just part of the solution – we also need to give them ways to take action to reduce their risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption can be attributed to as many as 7 percent of premature deaths worldwide, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, and making drinkers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/moderate-drinking-is-not-good-for-you-after-all-study-finds"&gt;more aware&lt;/a&gt; of the health risks is one way of tackling that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While health agencies have also looked at ways of making booze less readily available and more expensive, ultimately, personal choices will determine whether or not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-explain-what-drinking-while-on-medication-can-do-to-your-body"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-alcohol-on-planes-may-pose-a-hidden-danger-heres-why"&gt;around alcohol&lt;/a&gt; will shift in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg" alt="Different hands holding drinks" class="size-medium wp-image-146115" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Overdoing it on the booze is associated with a whole range of problems.

&lt;p&gt;Smoking leaves more than just a bad taste in your mouth — it could be fueling your oral cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11888749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies have consistently reported&lt;/a&gt; that cigarette users are five to 10 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/cannabis-use-disorder-triples-risk-of-oral-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A new study out of UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a chronic weed habit carries a higher risk of oral cancer as well. Researchers determined that people who often smoke marijuana are 3.25 times more likely to contract the disease within five years compared to those without cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis smoke contains many of the same &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/03/another-reminder-that-smoking-absolutely-destroys-your-lungs/"&gt;carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke&lt;/a&gt;, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth,” said &lt;a href="https://clre.ucsd.edu/faculty/raphael-cuomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Raphael Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic or problematic cannabis use may contribute to cancer risk in tissues exposed to combustion products.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Oral cancer encompasses cancers of the lips, tongue, gums and the lining of the cheeks and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Cancer Society projects&lt;/a&gt; that there will be nearly 60,000 new US cases of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer this year and about 12,800 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Oral cancer encompasses cancers of the lips, tongue, gums and the lining of the cheeks and mouth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TommyStockProject – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known risk factors of oral cancer include tobacco use, chronic alcohol consumption and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/health/oral-sex-is-fueling-oropharyngeal-cancer-surgeon-says/"&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cuomo’s team analyzed health data from over 45,000 oral cancer patients, including 949 who had been formally diagnosed with cannabis use disorder. They accounted for age, sex, body mass index and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They calculated that tobacco smokers with a cannabis addiction are 624% more likely to contract oral cancer within five years compared to cigarette users not prone to smoking marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers posited that the inhaled smoke is to blame because it can damage mouth tissues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edibles and beverages infused with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, don’t seem to carry a similar oral cancer risk as smoking weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Research is still evolving, so regular self-checks and dental exams remain wise for all cannabis users,” Cuomo told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;His findings were published&lt;/a&gt; in the September edition of Preventive Medicine Reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have consistently reported that cigarette users are five to 10 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-smokers. The risk goes up if cigarette smokers also smoke weed. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that there should be more exploration of the long-term effects of cannabis, and oral health awareness should be highlighted in substance use disorder treatment and counseling.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The UCSD study is not the first to sound the alarm about cannabis use and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/marijuana-use-tied-to-higher-risk-of-head-neck-cancers-study/"&gt;A 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Southern California linked daily marijuana use to a three to five-fold increase in the risk of head and neck cancers. Oral cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuomo suggests seeing a dentist or an ear, nose and throat specialist if you have a sore, ulcer or red or white patch in your mouth that has not healed after two weeks, especially if you have a lump, numbness, bleeding or pain when swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early evaluation is critical because oral cancers caught in the first stage are usually curable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

When babies are between 15 and 18 months old, they get a fourth shot, and the fifth somewhere between four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough causes bouts of coughing so extreme that they can lead to vomiting and broken ribs. Roughly a third of babies who are infected need to be treated in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year so far, five children, four of whom were babies under one, have died, while 10 died all of last year. Children that age have typically received three doses, which, altogether, are about 85 percent effective at preventing disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors nationwide are reporting a flurry of new patients being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of pertussis, which, along with a violent cough, can also cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-dcbfbd30-7149-11f0-9148-b7a3ccd1598d"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, and brain damage from lack of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whooping cough triggers such severe coughing fits followed by a 'whooping' sound in the chest that patients may vomit or even fracture ribs. Nearly one in three infected babies requires hospitalization (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, Kentucky officials announced that two babies had died over the previous six months, the first deaths in the state since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neither the babies nor their mothers were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in North Carolina, the state reported the first case of the year in June 2025. By the first week of August, there were 13 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My hospital, we had no cases in 2023, 13 in 2024, and already this year, and we’re only halfway through the year, we’ve had 27,’ Dr David Weber, Director of the UNC Medical Center’s infection prevention department, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-back-to-school-warning-as-whooping-cough-cases-rise-244275781508"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In neighboring South Carolina, 183 cases have been reported compared to 147 this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’re certainly seeing our vaccine rates decrease, especially post-Covid,' &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/south-carolina-whooping-cough-cases-rise/65557186"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;Dr Martha Buchanan, a family medicine physician with the South Carolina Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, I think it’s going to take us some time to recover from that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in Utah, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah-monthly-communicable-disease-report.html"&gt;at least 182 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported so far this year, compared to the five-year average to this point in the year of about 77 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;During the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6 percent of kindergarteners were exempted from one or more shots, up from 3.3 percent the year before. Most of the exemptions were among people with certain religious or philosophical views that disagree with vaccination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Washington County, Utah alone, health officials have &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/southern-utah/whooping-cough-mysteriously-packing-a-wallop-in-southern-utah-in-big-numbers"&gt;reported 28 cases&lt;/a&gt;, where the yearly average typically hovers around 10 to 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve seen admissions, an increased amount of kids that are needing to be hospitalized for it,’ Dr Kerri Smith, a pediatrician at St. George Regional Medical Center, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/southern-utah/whooping-cough-mysteriously-packing-a-wallop-in-southern-utah-in-big-numbers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tim Larsen, a pediatrician at the same medical center who has seen several patients in his outpatient clinic, added: ‘You get to that two-week, three-week mark, and it’s getting worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s at least a way to make the illness more mild when you do get it, and get it treated early. If you suspect whooping cough, bring them into the clinic.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend a booster shot every 10 years for everyone living in or around outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The past two years’ month-per-month case counts have coincided with steadily declining rates of vaccination among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slightly over &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;92 percent of kindergarteners&lt;/a&gt; entering the 2024-2025 school year had received the DTaP vaccine, lower than the herd immunity threshold of about 94 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reaching this threshold requires the vast majority of the population to be vaccinated, resulting in drastically lower odds of the pathogen be able to spread from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6 percent of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14411083/Outbreak-highly-contagious-childhood-disease-expands.html"&gt;kindergarteners were exempted&lt;/a&gt; from one or more shots, up from 3.3 percent the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of whooping cough often look like a common cold. But they worsen to include rib-cracking coughs and wheezing between coughing, as well as vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exemptions in the 2024-2025 school year increased in 36 states and Washington DC, with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of exemptions were for non-medical reasons, including for religious reasons and parents' personal beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 0.2 percent of exemptions were granted for medical reasons, such as as severe allergy, being immunocompromised, or having chronic autoimmune conditions. But a far higher 3.4 percent were granted for religious or philosophical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one percent of babies who become sick with whooping cough die from it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria Bordetella pertussis is often spread from parents, who may only exhibit cold-like symptoms, to their babies and young children, who are far less equipped to combat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women are encouraged to get a single dose of TDaP vaccine between the 27 and 36 week marks to boost the level of pertussis antibodies in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will protect their newborn babies if they are exposed to the disease before being vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough is treated with a regimen of antibiotics, which is crucial for killing the bacteria that cause the illness, reducing the severity of the disease and the risk of coming down with pneumonia, and shortening the duration of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 20:24:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxObjdlSkVjMmpDUEdZWE5pUE5XZHZhaElvZGpuME93NDRfNnJpa2VheUNpOU9qbjZXMDEwc2VjNTJkQlZSUXc5SGIzZmpPd1FFQUFyVVBVTFNwejk2U2dpNHFIb1dhYVVyZm5oV2QzaWx3MS1ET21pRDFrMXdmTk0tT3VNbHlVZ2lLQ0hLOUNtbkVWME4wOERVSWhIZmlJODhsT01WV1RjclBWeTdiclM1Yg</guid></item><item><title>随着病例创下新高，卫生官员警告维多利亚时代疾病的传播-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scourge of a preventable disease is roaring back after a pandemic lull, having already hit an annual milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent reliable data from the Pan American Health Organization as of May 31 reported more than 10,000 cases of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14386241/whooping-cough-deaths-rise-2024.html"&gt;vaccine-preventable pertussis&lt;/a&gt; in the US, otherwise known as whooping cough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the number of cases in the last week of May was about 4,800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typically less deadly than other vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough can be severe, especially among babies and children who have not received the complete five-dose regimen of the DTaP shot spread over the first six years of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DTaP regimen begins with the first shot at two months old, the second at four months and a subsequent shot at six months. When babies are between 15 and 18 months old, they get a fourth shot, and the fifth somewhere between four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough causes bouts of coughing so extreme that they can lead to vomiting and broken ribs. Roughly a third of babies who are infected need to be treated in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year so far, five children, four of whom were babies under one, have died, while 10 died all of last year. Children that age have typically received three doses, which, altogether, are about 85 percent effective at preventing disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors nationwide are reporting a flurry of new patients being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of pertussis, which, along with a violent cough, can also cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-dcbfbd30-7149-11f0-9148-b7a3ccd1598d"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, and brain damage from lack of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whooping cough triggers such severe coughing fits followed by a 'whooping' sound in the chest that patients may vomit or even fracture ribs. Nearly one in three infected babies requires hospitalization (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;In case you needed more incentive to cut down on ultra-processed foods, a new diet swap study out today reveals that people experienced greater weight loss while eating minimally processed foods than they did when they ate a nutritionally similar, ultra-processed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a six-month trial led by scientists at University College London, study participants were assigned one of the two diet regimes to follow for eight weeks, and then took a four week break before swapping to the other diet for another eight weeks. Participants lost more weight while eating the minimally processed diet than the ultra-processed one; they also shed more unhealthy fat. The findings, published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;Monday in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that, among other things, ultra-processed diets are especially good at stoking people’s food cravings, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although there is some &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/defining-ultra-processed-foods-is-debated-5509462"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; over what constitutes an ultra-processed food, there are generally considered products or ingredients that have gone through high levels of industrialized processing, like breakfast sausages, candy, or sodas. There is a growing mountain of evidence that suggests a diet rich in ultra-processed foods is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ultra-processed-foods-health-effects-depression-sleep-1851298904"&gt;less healthy overall&lt;/a&gt; than a diet made up of mostly whole foods, and that ultra-processed foods may raise the risk of certain diseases. Most of this research, however, only shows a correlation between ultra-processed diets and poorer health outcomes, and not a direct cause-and-effect link. Clinical trials can provide stronger evidence, but they’re notoriously difficult to do in the world of nutrition science for many reasons, particularly funding, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Clinical trials are expensive, and there’s been a generally lower amount of funding for diet and nutrition research given its importance for health,” study author &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/79347-sam-dicken"&gt;Sam Dicken&lt;/a&gt;, a research fellow at UCL’s department of behavioral science and health, told Gizmodo. “We were fortunate to have joint funding from a medical charity and a UK non-governmental organization to fund the trial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study involved 55 adult volunteers who ate either a minimally processed diet or an ultra-processed diet made up of prepackaged meals for eight weeks, then took a four-week break before switching to the diet they hadn’t eaten yet for another eight weeks. Importantly, both eating regimens were crafted to follow the U.K.’s dietary recommendations, so the ultra-processed diet wasn’t designed to be vastly different in nutritional quality from the minimally processed diet. For example, the ultra-processed diet included breakfast cereal as a meal, while the equivalent minimally processed meal was overnight oats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter which diet people followed, they lost weight, but the difference between the two regimens was significant. People eating a minimally processed diet lost an average of 2% of their baseline weight, while those on the ultra-processed diet lost an average of 1% and consumed slightly more calories overall. And people who lost weight on the minimally processed diet specifically lost more fat-related mass and visceral fat than they did on the ultra-processed diet. Visceral fat surrounds our abdominal organs and is associated with worse health outcomes than other types of fat found elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the importance of following government dietary guidelines, Dicken said. But the study also indicates that people who want to lose weight may see the most benefit from sticking to minimally processed foods. As to why the ultra-processed foods are worse for dieting, the researchers have their educated guesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods tend to have more appealing textures and artificially boosted flavors, which often means they are softer or easier to eat, and tastier. Their appearance and packaging might also make them more visually appealing to potential customers. Interestingly, the volunteers in this study reported that both diets were equally satisfying to eat on average, but they also reported having better control over their cravings while on the minimally processed diet. Dicken noted that the researchers weren’t able to directly test these potential explanations in this trial, though, so more research is needed to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team has already launched their next study, which is testing out a behavioral support program to reduce people’s intake of ultra-processed foods. But Dicken cautioned that it will take widespread societal shifts, not individual scolding, to change our collective diets for the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Policy actions that improve our obesogenic food environment and move away from individual responsibility are needed to ensure healthy diets are accessible and affordable for all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From fabricated research to paid authorships and citations, organized scientific fraud is on the rise, according to a new Northwestern University study.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;By combining large-scale data analysis of scientific literature with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/case+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers led a deep investigation into scientific fraud. Although concerns around &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+misconduct/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific misconduct&lt;/a&gt; typically focus on lone individuals, the Northwestern study instead uncovered sophisticated global networks of individuals and entities, which systematically work together to undermine the integrity of academic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is so widespread that the publication of fraudulent science is outpacing the growth rate of legitimate scientific publications. The authors argue these findings should serve as a wake-up call to the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific community&lt;/a&gt;, which needs to act before the public loses confidence in the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "The entities enabling scientific fraud at scale are large, resilient and growing rapidly," was published in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Science must police itself better in order to preserve its integrity," said Northwestern's Luís A. N. Amaral, the study's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we do not create awareness around this problem, worse and worse behavior will become normalized. At some point, it will be too late, and scientific literature will become completely poisoned. Some people worry that talking about this issue is attacking science. But I strongly believe we are defending science from bad actors. We need to be aware of the seriousness of this problem and take measures to address it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expert in complex social systems, Amaral is the Erastus Otis Haven Professor and professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. Reese Richardson, a postdoctoral fellow in Amaral's laboratory, is the paper's first author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Extensive analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people think about scientific fraud, they might remember news reports of retracted papers, falsified data or plagiarism. These reports typically center around the isolated actions of one individual, who takes shortcuts to get ahead in an increasingly competitive industry. But Amaral and his team uncovered a widespread underground network operating within the shadows and outside of the public's awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These networks are essentially criminal organizations, acting together to fake the process of science," Amaral said. "Millions of dollars are involved in these processes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed extensive datasets of retracted publications, editorial records and instances of image duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the data came from major aggregators of scientific literature, including Web of Science (WoS), Elsevier's Scopus, National Library of Medicine's PubMed/MEDLINE and OpenAlex, which includes data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref, ORCID, Unpaywall and other institutional repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richardson and his colleagues also collected lists of de-indexed journals, which are &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scholarly+journals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scholarly journals&lt;/a&gt; that have been removed from databases for failing to meet certain quality or ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also included data on retracted articles from Retraction Watch, article comments from PubPeer and metadata—such as editor names, submission dates and acceptance dates—from articles published in specific journals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Buying a reputation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data, the team uncovered coordinated efforts involving "paper mills," brokers and infiltrated journals. Functioning much like factories, paper mills churn out large numbers of manuscripts, which they then sell to academics who want to quickly publish new work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These manuscripts are mostly low quality—featuring fabricated data, manipulated or even stolen images, plagiarized content and sometimes nonsensical or physically impossible claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More and more scientists are being caught up in paper mills," Amaral said. "Not only can they buy papers, but they can buy citations. Then, they can appear like well-reputed scientists when they have barely conducted their own research at all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Paper mills operate by a variety of different models," Richardson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, we have only just been able to scratch the surface of how they operate. But they sell basically anything that can be used to launder a reputation. They often sell authorship slots for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. A person might pay more money for the first author position or less money for a fourth author position. People can also pay to get papers they have written automatically accepted in a journal through a sham peer-review process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify more articles originating from paper mills, the Amaral group launched a parallel project that automatically scans published materials science and engineering papers. The team specifically looked for authors who misidentified instruments they used in their research. A paper with those results was accepted by the journal &lt;i&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Brokers, hijacking and collusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaral, Richardson and their collaborators found fraudulent networks use several key strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups of researchers collude to publish papers across multiple journals. When their activities are discovered, the papers are subsequently retracted;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokers serve as intermediaries to enable mass publication of fraudulent papers in compromised journals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fraudulent activities are concentrated in specific, vulnerable subfields;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organized entities evade quality-control measures, such as journal de-indexing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Brokers connect all the different people behind the scenes," Amaral said. "You need to find someone to write the paper. You need to find people willing to pay to be the authors. You need to find a journal where you can get it all published. And you need editors in that journal who will accept that paper."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these organizations go around established journals altogether, searching instead for defunct journals to hijack. When a legitimate journal stops publishing, for example, bad actors can take over its name or website. These actors surreptitiously assume the journal's identity, lending credibility to its fraudulent publications, despite the actual publication being defunct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This happened to the journal HIV Nursing," Richardson said. "It was formerly the journal of a professional nursing organization in the U.K., then it stopped publishing, and its online domain lapsed. An organization bought the domain name and started publishing thousands of papers on subjects completely unrelated to nursing, all indexed in Scopus."&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;h2&gt;Fighting for science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this growing threat to legitimate scientific publishing, Amaral and Richardson emphasize the need for a multi-prong approach. This approach includes enhanced scrutiny of editorial processes, improved methods for detecting fabricated research, a greater understanding of the networks facilitating this misconduct and a radical restructuring of the system of incentives in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaral and Richardson also underscore the importance of addressing these issues before artificial intelligence (AI) infiltrates scientific literature more than it already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we're not prepared to deal with the fraud that's already occurring, then we're certainly not prepared to deal with what generative AI can do to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+literature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific literature&lt;/a&gt;," Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have no clue what's going to end up in the literature, what's going to be regarded as scientific fact and what's going to be used to train future AI models, which then will be used to write more papers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study is probably the most depressing project I've been involved with in my entire life," Amaral said. "Since I was a kid, I was excited about science. It's distressing to see others engage in fraud and in misleading others. But if you believe that science is useful and important for humanity, then you have to fight for it."&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Flu shot season is around the corner, and while injections remain the most common form of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-vaccine-for-yeast-infections-could-soon-be-reality-2000617388"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, scientists are working hard to find other ways to deliver inoculations that don’t involve shoving a needle into your flesh. And in a new study, researchers think they might have found another novel approach: dental floss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the new work, a team of scientists based in the U.S. demonstrated how this might work on lab mice, finding that vaccine delivery via dental floss was more effective at stimulating antibody production than if the vaccine was delivered under the mice’s tongues and about as effective as a nasal spray delivery method. If the results hold true for humans, then some vaccines could be given via tooth tape and without the need for needles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here we show that flat tape dental floss can deliver vaccines through the junctional epithelium of the gingival sulcus, exploiting its naturally leaky properties,” the researchers wrote in the study, which was published in July in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. The junctional epithelium is the technical term for the deep tissue between the tooth and the gum. Epithelial tissues are one of three layers of so-called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa"&gt;mucosal&lt;/a&gt; surfaces, which are the membranes that lubricate and protect your body’s organs and cavities, including your nose, mouth, and intestines. Many pathogens like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;influenza and Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; can enter the body through these mucosal surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If a vaccine is given by injection, antibodies are primarily produced in the bloodstream throughout the body, and relatively few antibodies are produced on mucosal surfaces,” Harvinder Singh Gill, co-author of the study and a professor in Nanomedicine at North Carolina State University, explained in a &lt;a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2025/07/vaccines-via-dental-floss/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But we know that when a vaccine is given via the mucosal surface, antibodies are stimulated not only in the bloodstream, but also on mucosal surfaces.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This improves the body’s ability to prevent infection, because there is an additional line of antibody defense before a pathogen enters the body,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the tissue in between our teeth and gums is more permeable than other similar tissues, like those lining your stomach, lungs, and intestines, then it should be able to introduce &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-shingles-vaccine-could-be-a-secret-weapon-against-heart-attacks-2000598150"&gt;a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; into the body relatively easily, triggering the production of antibodies throughout the mucosal layers. To test this idea, the researchers applied peptide flu vaccine on unwaxed dental floss, and then used it to floss the teeth of lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gill and colleagues then compared the animals’ antibody production to that of mice that either received the peptide flu vaccine via a nasal spray or under their tongues. The dental floss vaccine delivered significantly superior antibody production on mucosal surfaces than the under-the-tongue inoculation, and was comparable to the nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is extremely promising, because most vaccine formulations cannot be given via the nasal epithelium—the barrier features in that mucosal surface prevent efficient uptake of the vaccine,” said Gill, adding that nasal delivery also carries the risk of the vaccine reaching the brain, which could pose safety concerns. “Vaccination via the junctional epithelium offers no such risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team also tested the floss approach with three other vaccine classes—proteins, inactivated viruses, and mRNA—and revealed that the novel method triggered antibodies both in the bloodstream and mucosal surfaces in all of them. What’s more, their efficacy wasn’t impeded if the mice consumed food or water right after flossing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate the practicality of the flossing approach, the researchers also tested its mechanics with humans. Using floss picks, they coated the tape with food dye and asked study participants to try and get it as deep between their teeth and their gums as they could. Participants were able to deposit around 60% of the dye in the gum pocket, indicating that vaccine-coated floss picks could be an effective way to deliver vaccines to that tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As for costs, the researchers think that it would be similar in price to other vaccine delivery techniques. However, there are some inherent limitations to a floss vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For example, it can only be used for individuals with teeth,” the researchers explained in the study. “Therefore, this approach cannot be used in neonates [newborns] until they experience teeth eruption, which typically occurs at around 6 months of age. Further, the impact of gingival tissue infection on vaccination is unclear. Additional studies are required to answer this question.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Vitamin D &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regularly taking a Vitamin D supplement can help improve bone health, muscles and immune health and studies have also shown that it can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14915003/link-reduce-risk-dementia-vitamin-d-supplement.html"&gt;reduce the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts say that drinking caffeine can reduce the production of Vitamin D receptors cells. This can hinder the body's ability to absorb the vitamin from supplements and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2024, about 42 percent of American suffer from Vitamin D deficiency. Low Vitamin D can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones) as well as muscle pain and weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Elise Kim, a New York-based pharmacist, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-with-coffee-11783883"&gt;Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;: 'Research suggests that caffeine may reduce the expression of Vitamin D receptors, which can lower vitamin D levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While more research is needed to discover why coffee affects cell receptors, a 2021 International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research found initial links between high caffeine intake and low circulating levels of vitamin D in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo suggests taking Vitamin D supplements with a meal that includes healthy fats to help improve absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;2. Calcium &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to Vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements also help improve bone, heart, brain and cell health, protecting against cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But due to the diuretic effect of caffeine, drinking coffee can interfere with how the body absorbs calcium from supplements by increasing the amount of calcium the kidneys eliminate through urine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lower calcium absorption in the body as most of it would be removed from the body instead of being reabsorbed by the kidneys, as evidenced by a 2012 Nutrition study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adding milk to your coffee may help offset calcium loss and spacing out calcium supplements two hours after your coffee help support better absorption, Dr Kim suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A low calcium level, also known as hypocalcemia, can lead to a variety of health problems including muscle cramps, numbness or tingling, fatigue and bone problems like osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, it can also lead to seizures, heart problems and even breathing difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors recommend waiting at least an hour after drinking a cup of coffee to take supplements for better nutrient absorption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;3. Iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary use of iron supplements is to treat or prevent iron-deficiency anemia, a condition where the body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body due to insufficient iron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it is also prescribed to reduce fatigue, improve hair health, increase athletic performance and boost immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is also crucial for brain function and taking supplements can enhance concentration, memory, and overall cognitive performance in those with low iron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Philip Ngo, a pharmacist with over a decade of experience in community pharmacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors claim that caffeine and tannins in coffee present in the body after drinking a cup can bind to iron in supplement capsules, making it harder for the body to absorb the mineral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 American Journal of Hematology study found taking iron supplements after drinking coffee reduced body absorption by 54 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bo Wang, an internal medicine physician at the US Department of Veteran Affairs, &lt;span&gt;told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-with-coffee-11783883"&gt;Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;: 'Having coffee with an iron supplement or fortified cereal may make your body absorb less iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Over time, a heavy caffeine habit could potentially impact bone and mineral health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To ensure maximum absorption, Dr Wang advised taking supplements with vitamin C-rich foods, such as lemons and oranges rather than coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;4. Magnesium &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium is a necessary mineral the body requires for the proper growth and maintenance of bones, nerve and muscle function, blood sugar management, blood pressure regulation and sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those suffering from migraine headaches, Type 2 diabetes, low bone density, cardiovascular disease and sleep problems are usually advised to take magnesium supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But similarly to calcium, Dr Kim explained: 'Caffeine can increase calcium and magnesium loss through urine.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine can negatively impact magnesium absorption by increasing its excretion through urine, potentially leading to lower magnesium levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, coffee contains tannins and phytates, both compounds that can bind to minerals like magnesium and hinder its absorption in the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;5. B Vitamins &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Water-soluble B vitamins including B1, B2, B7, B9 and B12 play crucial roles in various bodily functions and are often taken as supplements to address deficiencies or support overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of these vitamins are also essential for energy production, nerve function, cell growth, and red blood cell formation.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the diuretic effects of caffeine can potentially cause problems with absorption of certain B vitamins as it can flush out the vitamin from the body through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Dr Wong explained: 'B vitamins are water-soluble, caffeine’s mild diuretic effect can increase how much your body excretes, especially with higher caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoid taking supplements with coffee or tea. Wait an hour if you can. Water-soluble vitamins (C, Bs) are fine with or without food, but may go down easier after a meal.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:47:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPOWFNaDJvMHZXSWJXSE5IRGRtNWsyYlljMk5Pc2NHTlNGOE41R3FjQXoxdUxYdHdvM21OM2JsTlcyVnIyWlIzekxfY0ZDNzlUN2otMndmQ3pqaFVZSTNXSHQ1WmVNR3RMMnFVYmxTS2dRNXJZM3NSalBvbHU2bXY1aFFEVXlDb2N6V01RaEx5eUJHQllYNXhJX0lrY3NfWkdfVkJF0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1VNEdUcF81TS1QSHR0YzQxWl9XTXo4ZndvMWhGWWNFZV9KbUh5eUs5S1d1Q0RZd2JFbHdoZ1FGWW5qSVhvRDVDSkU3Q0lobmhmMzFqTVhZdjBjMjJkcVlYV2hYMW1fWngwSTlycFU2NGh6a2NpUm12czlFRm5WZmY1T0FyMFNDeDFWc1dPZ05JQzFXdm5nUG1mZmo5Vmt2R196eFFZYW5kOQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生部长：预算中的糖尿病儿童CGM -特立尼达和多巴哥新闻日报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPMmI2dEtnNTdFSm9fS2pIbTNlSGp6XzZhN2gxcGpKQXVVT093a25rbTBCbVE4X2M5ZzJKRWE1Y2VjNkVPODNwUElXX2JBNFFqQ29DUU5weUp5elphdk14cDREY2lFcGRubWVyakVtcHVHTjk4a2RzcGZJLTg4Rlo4Y1MzRklOVXdjTW1zZU0zbVlTZWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23432961-683x1024.jpg" alt="Six year old Tiana Romain show off her continuous glucose monitor device which she received from Dr Andrew Dhanoo, president of the Diabetes Association of TT. - Photo by Lincoln Holder"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six year old Tiana Romain show off her continuous glucose monitor device which she received from Dr Andrew Dhanoo, president of the Diabetes Association of TT. - Photo by Lincoln Holder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Minister of Health Dr Lackram Bodoe said consideration will be given in the 2025/2026 budget to provide Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) for children with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from a push by the Diabetes Association of TT (DATT) to have the monitors covered by the Chronic Disease Assistance Programme (CDAP) for children born with type-one diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Bodoe said Minister in the Ministry of Health Dr Rishaad Seecharan recently met with DATT president Andrew Dhanoo to discuss the request, following which he met with Dhanoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I did give the commitment that the government will try to find the money to purchase...really, what is in need there is the sensors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodoe said about $2 million was requested, but, given budgetary restraints, the entire ask may not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he said he would explore other avenues to facilitate the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1170242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1170242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1170242" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24169881-1024x683.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1170242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Minister of Health Lackram Bodoe - Photo by Jeff K. Mayers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Childhood obesity and by extension childhood diabetes, and these are type one diabetics, not all of them are related to obesity, remains a very important group of the population and, as a government, we are committed to doing everything possible with the issues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CGM is a small sensor with a needle that can be attached by a user to a suitable part of their body, like a patch, to provide continuous monitoring of their blood sugar levels throughout the day. The monitor can be synchronised to a cellphone app and, apart from reading sugar levels, can also alert the user or their caretakers when it gets to a dangerously high or low level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CGM can remain attached to a person up to around two weeks before needing a new one to be reapplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been hailed by many parents as being a lifechanger in helping managing their children's condition but it costs around $15,000 annually to replace the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Newsday on July 20, Dhanoo estimated that around 200 children were living with the condition in the country, but their parents could not afford the steep price for the technology. He said while they provide the machines at cost price to children and even help find sponsors to give those most in need, government intervention was needed because of its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the machines were being assessed by the Ministry of Health's Chemistry, Food and Drug Division before the change in government came on April 28.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

When you’ve got one, you constantly feel like you need to pee even if you just went, it burns when you go and your urine looks suspiciously cloudy. UTIs are also quite common: More than &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/urinary-tract-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:50% of women;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;50% of women&lt;/a&gt; will deal with at least one in their lifetime, and what’s worse is that these infections can come back in a matter of months.

(Drugs &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-treatment-uncomplicated-urinary-tract-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pivya;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Pivya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-new-treatment-uncomplicated-urinary-tract-infections-adult-women-who-have-limited-or-no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Orlynvah;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Orlynvah&lt;/a&gt; were approved in 2024 to treat UTIs, but they fall into existing antibiotic classes.) “Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes,” DeTata says. “This class is so new that currently, gepotidacin is the only one in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Antibiotics fight bacteria in two main ways: They can kill bacteria (bactericidal) or they can prevent them from multiplying (bacteriostatic), says DeTata. For example, some antibiotics interfere with the formation of bacteria cell walls, causing the wall to burst and killing the bacteria, while others disrupt the synthesis of proteins, which bacteria need to survive. “Gepotidacin works in an entirely new way by acting on enzymes called topoisomerases, leading to breaks in the DNA strands of bacteria,” DeTata says. “So gepotidacin is bactericidal, as these breaks in the DNA strands kill the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The drug’s main side effects in clinical trials were diarrhea (16% of participants) and nausea (9%), both which are common side effects for antibiotics in general. The research also found that gepotidacin performs just as well as (if not better than) nitrofurantoin, which is a frontline treatment for UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Added bonus: Gepotidacin “has the potential to be used for the treatment of gonorrhea, which has also been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/super-gonorrheais-rare-but-the-sti-is-smart--and-doctors-are-concerned-213856598.html" data-ylk="slk:difficult to treat due to multi-antibiotic resistance;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;difficult to treat due to multi-antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;,” says DeTata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Weiss and many other doctors, having a new treatment option for UTIs is something to celebrate. “I’m very excited that a new medication has come to market,” he says. “Any new medication for something so common is a win-win situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="ct:story;elm:img;itc:0;" class="stretched-box" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/article/how-innovations-in-womens-health-are-making-it-a-priority--not-an-afterthought-210038571.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:45:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNMXkwYm5MMEhhM2IxYUpRYVMwNTlsb2llSnZUbnFKejVkS1FGVUJSbnVHaGVnckZzLWE2OEFYaFNIZmF0WHNCSTNaNVYxNjhPbk5XVDlrUnBUUm96NEE4VzUxY1NGazdlekptbVBGbTYtblJFQnNvX1BlZGpEMVp0aDE2T1lfWUFMQXExbkVGdnRHUXRqV1lXb3VuV0FvLTZONWxCNDRZNy1FZ3RYclVPczF5UmlsRmU4Wmc2dmtSVEdOSV9iX0NnRWJxZFRXMGg2bGk3XzZzSW9aT1NMNDhabnMwaVpSaU9L</guid></item><item><title>法官拒绝保释被指控驾驶四轮车越过受害者的男子- Midcoast Villager</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAJBVV95cUxONGQ1MnJMbFRtUnlGNDBEMTIwdnVaRmdzSFRLVExHMmhWSkJ4VG1NTl92Q3pvUDI3LXFVWTB0dXE2LTBUUlpqZkRHWFhYZG56RGRkTEZ3UFB1dF83YmFIV3B4RUhrWWtKMUUzQkdwN09FVUJVUG5QcW9kdzRUaElCcUtpbThtYndxakpzM1VaWkRMeUs0R2tmOUx3MHkzTllUUkcwOUR0bXFSeEtuUU5wZnBtaE9FNkhlY0NBMjZaNGhQTjNxbVozRUg3T2NhaFNRWVFVaXZraXVjT1dtX1RuM1RrQkgtMmh3NE9oVS1Bb1hkVGh5ZE1GdEpVTTB1Nm5nX1k4WA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="form-group-flex"&gt;

Unlike other groups of drug users—who tended to report persistently worse mental health—this group’s mental health scores became comparable to those of individuals who had never used illicit drugs. The findings have been published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811251346729" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics are a class of substances that alter perception, mood, and cognitive processes. Classic psychedelics include psilocybin (the active compound in magic mushrooms), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These substances are known for producing intense alterations in consciousness, including visual and auditory hallucinations, shifts in thought patterns, and changes in self-perception. Unlike more commonly used substances such as alcohol or cannabis, psychedelics are often used less frequently and in settings intended to foster introspection or emotional insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in recent years has reignited interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Clinical trials have explored their effects on conditions such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. Some studies have also suggested that psychedelics may help people cope with stress or improve emotional resilience when used outside clinical settings. However, most evidence has come from small, controlled trials, while data on real-world, long-term use has remained limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted daily life and mental well-being, creating a natural context in which to study how people coped with stress—including through drug use. Although overall drug consumption decreased in some cases, many individuals began using or increased their use of drugs like cannabis and psychedelics as a way of managing distress. However, most prior research focused on alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis and often grouped all other substances together, making it difficult to understand how different types of drugs might relate to mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-balaet/" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Bălăeţ&lt;/a&gt;—now head of the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aset.lab/" target="_blank"&gt;Altered States, Evolution and Technology Laboratory (ASET LAB)&lt;/a&gt; at King’s College London and formerly of Imperial College London—sought to understand how specific patterns of drug use were associated with mental health symptoms before and during the pandemic. The study is part of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5tFHwWMgg9VbrHT9kvGlFqd/the-great-british-intelligence-test" target="_blank"&gt;the Great British Intelligence Test&lt;/a&gt;, a citizen science initiative supported by the BBC and designed to examine links between lifestyle, cognition, and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited online between December 2019 and early 2022, both before and after COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in the UK. More than 240,000 individuals completed baseline assessments, and about 68,000 provided follow-up data at three separate timepoints: December 2020, June 2021, and January 2022. The researchers used a variety of tools to track changes in mental health, including adapted items from the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales, which measure symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked about their use of a wide range of illicit substances, including cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. Using a data-driven technique known as k-modes clustering, the researchers identified six distinct groups based on drug use patterns: cannabis-only users, cocaine-only users, users of both cannabis and cocaine, users of both cannabis and psychedelics, polydrug users, and users of unspecified “other” drugs. These groups were compared with drug-naive individuals and with people who had used drugs in the past but not during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Back in 2023, I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1184681" target="_blank"&gt;published a cross-sectional analysis&lt;/a&gt; where I compared the mental health of drug-user groups relative to drug-naive individuals during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I was surprised when I saw that, contrary to my hypothesis, the psychedelics and cannabis group had significantly poorer mental health and resilience,” Bălăeţ said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This made me hypothesize that perhaps we can only see improvements following psychedelic experiences if we look at the same individuals before and after, but not relative to drug-naive individuals. This would mean that psychedelics may indeed work to improve mental health, but would not make the group of users more mentally healthy than the drug naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed-effects models were used to track how symptoms changed over time within and between groups, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, exercise, and meditation habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, nearly all individuals who reported using drugs—including psychedelics—had worse average mental health scores than people who had never used illicit substances. This pattern held across all major symptoms measured, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating. People who increased their drug use during the pandemic also tended to see their mental health worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the group of participants who used both psychedelics and cannabis showed a different trend. Although they began the study with elevated symptoms of depression and lower overall mental health scores, their average scores improved by the final follow-up in January 2022. Specifically, depression scores dropped by about a quarter of a standard deviation, anxiety scores also fell by a similar amount, and overall mental health scores improved. By the end of the study, their scores were no different from those of drug-naive individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern did not hold for cannabis-only users. People in that group consistently reported worse mental health across all symptoms and timepoints, with no significant improvements. Those who used both psychedelics and cannabis and decreased their usage over time reported better mental health outcomes than those who increased usage or made no change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these improvements occurred despite the fact that the psychedelics and cannabis group, like other users, began with poorer mental health than the drug-naive group. This suggests that something changed for this group over time, while others stayed relatively stable or declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My current paper illustrates that not only improvements in mental health are a possibility within the group of psychedelics and cannabis users, confirming my hypothesis, but also a normalization of mental health across users is a possibility, making them on par with the drug naive,” Bălăeţ told PsyPost. “I suppose this is somewhat surprising, because these results emerge from an observational study of naturalistic use, not controlled administration within a clinical setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, I would note the key importance of the global context in the potential interpretation of results – when the mental health of the group of psychedelics and cannabis users was worse than that of drug naive group, this occurred during a period of global crisis, whereas the normalization was observed in the aftermath of the stressful period that the peak-pandemic was, during relatively calmer times. In another paper, I explore how the context where experiences with psychedelics happen may drive the experiences themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main strengths of the study is its exceptionally large and diverse sample, which included over 240,000 individuals and allowed for robust statistical analyses across different drug use patterns. The longitudinal design enabled the researchers to track mental health changes over time rather than relying solely on cross-sectional data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study had a large sample of participants, which was recruited for an intelligence study, and who also consented to answering a brief drug survey at various timepoints,” Bălăeţ said. “Therefore, we can have higher confidence in the ecological validity of our results than if individuals were recruited from channels specifically endorsing drug use or psychedelics, which may be biased toward positive experiences with these substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers caution against drawing firm conclusions about cause and effect. One alternative explanation for the observed improvements is regression to the mean—a statistical phenomenon where extreme scores tend to move closer to the average over time. It’s also possible that people whose mental health was already improving were more likely to use psychedelics near the time of the final survey. Without information on the exact timing or frequency of psychedelic use, it’s difficult to determine what came first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also lacked data on dosage, “set and setting” (i.e., the psychological and environmental context of drug use), or the presence of co-occurring treatments like therapy or psychiatric medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings suggest that psychedelics may play a distinct role in shaping mental health trajectories, particularly in times of collective stress. Unlike cannabis-only users, those who also used psychedelics reported average improvements over a two-year period, pointing to the possibility that the broader context in which these substances are used—along with their unique psychological effects—could contribute to changes in well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, though, these are group average effects, and there was notable variability within each group of drug users regardless of their substances of choice,” Bălăeţ noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by examining timing, frequency, and context of use, and by exploring how psychedelics interact with cannabis and other substances. Longitudinal studies that include in-depth interviews or real-time monitoring could also help clarify whether psychedelic use during difficult life periods supports mental health in ways that differ from other forms of drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of amazing research in the pipeline, with key study findings currently being prepared for publication,” Bălăeţ said. “I am particularly interested in the associations between naturalistic drug use, cognition, and creativity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251346729" target="_blank"&gt;Naturalistic use of psychedelics is associated with longitudinal improvements in anxiety and depression during global crisis times&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Maria Bălăeţ, William Trender, Annalaura Lerede, Peter J Hellyer, and Adam Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:06:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPdlMxczVlSTNkZXhBRzF5Wnp2M200Q2tPYXlPTDVHcy13MUtHRGNxcEdadEp2U3hrWmJJdU5OdllZWGhEYUlCeUhFRExMUi1UNFE4dVVDTHV4V1IyT3lySzFUZXFKMnY1UU9LX3h2V0tWeE9waExPOUlmUDZ0bnBTNWdnQ3hocHpsSndlTlN0b0JZYmtDN3JRNjNLUTAyWVlDUXFN</guid></item><item><title>野生蝙蝠在度假时飞进嘴里，女子被2万美元的医疗账单击中-《印度斯坦时报》-《印度斯坦时报》</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101754329343337 " data-vars-storyid="101754329343337" data-story-section="trending" data-story-subsection="us" data-vars-author="HT Trending Desk" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Woman hit with $20,000 medical bill after wild bat flies into her mouth on vacation&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Updated on: Aug 04, 2025 11:16 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;A Massachusetts woman incurred $20,000 in medical bills after a bat flew into her mouth during a vacation in Arizona.&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div class="storyDetails taboola-readmore"&gt; &lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/us/woman-hit-with-20-000-medical-bill-after-wild-bat-flies-into-her-mouth-on-vacation-101754329343337.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts woman's vacation ended up costing her $20,000 after a wild bat flew into her mouth. 33-year-old Erica Kahn was on vacation at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona when the winged mammal flew into her mouth. The former biomedical engineer is finally rabies-free after a long treatment and has been stuck with $20,000 in medical bills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/04/550x309/bat_1754329460681_1754329460857.jpg" alt="Erica Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them.(Representational)" title="Erica Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them.(Representational)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/04/550x309/bat_1754329460681_1754329460857.jpg" alt="Erica Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them.(Representational)" title="Erica Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them.(Representational)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Erica Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them.(Representational)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kahn had noticed multiple bats flying while she took pictures of the night sky, but ignored them. However, one of them got too close to her and got trapped between her camera and face. As she screamed in terror, the mammal's body ended up in her mouth for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her father, a doctor, who was with her on the trip, immediately took her to get rabies treatment even though she did not believe she was bitten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently laid off and with no medical insurance, Kahn rushed to purchase a medical insurance plan before going to the hospital. She believed that it would cover her two-week course of rabies shots across different states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, when the bill came due, she was shocked to discover that she owed $20,749 to four medical institutions for treatment, including doses of the rabies vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is when she realised that the insurance plan required a 30-day waiting period before coverage would start.

In extreme heat, fans may paradoxically &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132325007413" target="_blank"&gt;make you&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;hotter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQVPNWV7T5HXZILHF2PRTTHQRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There is no benefit to a fan. It doesn’t actually reduce body temperature,” said Glen Kenny, a professor of physiology at the University of Ottawa and the university research chair in human environmental physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LK6QKG5I45ECFL35NV5YA3AVJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This is especially concerning for older adults who, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5645224/" target="_blank"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt;, experience greater stress on the heart when using electric fans during high temperatures. The reason scientists think this happens is that electric fans increase air velocity and make our bodies gain dry heat. This also aggravates &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dehydration-can-creep-up-on-you-and-cause-serious-health-problems/2017/08/11/5ec2c10c-30e3-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;. Younger adults normally compensate by sweating more — after all, sweat is our bodies’ main way of cooling down — but we &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4155032/" target="_blank"&gt;lose our ability&lt;/a&gt; to sweat as robustly when we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3VJ2CMAPN5F43EW52VQQZ57SJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/risk-factors/heat-and-low-income.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; being in air conditioning at least a few hours a day during a heat wave, but that may not work in every situation (&lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=52558" target="_blank"&gt;as many as 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. households don’t use air conditioning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GBZSJWKYSFDIPJ76VAIW6TBW2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So to make your fan more effective, try this: Wet your skin first. Use a spray bottle or a sponge to intermittently apply cool tap water to the body — or better yet, if you can, drench your whole shirt. Studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01209-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of electric fans and skin-wetting — but not electric fans alone — can reduce heat strain in temperatures as high as 116 degrees. Wetting the skin works because when that water evaporates off our skin, it wicks heat away with it. That’s the entire reason sweating cools us off — but by wetting your skin from another source, you get all the benefits of evaporation while also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015226/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing dehydration&lt;/a&gt; by about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IRSZWMMPVZC4DEO3NBIOMZFWHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IRSZWMMPVZC4DEO3NBIOMZFWHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Not a fan of fans&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VY72P6HRRCIPH54JB7QCJAR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, Kenny and his team published &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11581471/" target="_blank"&gt;a study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; studying the effects of electric fans among older adults. Participants aged 65 to 85 sat for eight hours in 96.8 degree heat and were allowed to drink as much water as they wanted, but some were randomized to an electric fan, while others weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YR2LTJWRAFCRJDT74GFDCNEHHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You would think the fan-users would be cooler, but in reality, all groups reached the same level of hyperthermia and strain on the heart. The only difference, Kenny said, was that the fan-users “felt better” and looked happy as they approached heat exhaustion, while the group who weren’t using fans were acutely aware of their misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RDNIO7RMEZG6RGX4THOR3Y32LY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The mind trick occurs because fans soothe many of the body’s thermal sensors on the surface of our skin. These send a signal telling the brain that the entire body must be comfortable and that we don’t need to sweat so aggressively. But because fans don’t really cool your core, this can create a dangerous and false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4J4T5NQJ45EDVGCXX3UY6DT4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For one thing, it could lead people to change their behavior, Kenny said. They might go out and buy groceries, take a walk outside or do other activities that push them over the brink of heat exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6FZRDZILVGAZEGJ7J75ERUUHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Feeling good from fans has nothing to do with the actual change in the body’s physiology. It’s just that those sensors that we have in the body are playing games with you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4RZDNFQII5DFJCEMRUTJKFTJ54" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4RZDNFQII5DFJCEMRUTJKFTJ54" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;More science-backed ways to stay cool&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WXTGMLYRRAG3LJXAR3W3H6HNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It bears reemphasizing the importance of air conditioning during a heat wave (though there is a significant &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/07/air-conditioners-humid-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental cost&lt;/a&gt;). Even if you don’t have air conditioning at home, a visit to a shopping mall, public library or other air-conditioned environments is associated with a 67 percent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17698676/" target="_blank"&gt;reduced risk&lt;/a&gt; of heat wave-related death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3QZZ2N5E4BFFFDGHEBL2ZA7DQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are a few other science-backed tips that work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="ISY3HGKLUFE3PFCDXKSWV5EETA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use shading and natural ventilation to prevent heat from building up in your home.&lt;/b&gt; Close window shades during a sunny day and crack open a window to let out hot air; both can help keep indoor temperatures from cooking. When you get in your car on a hot day, open the windows to ventilate for a minute or two first; this helps the air conditioning work its magic more quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrate. Even hot coffee on a hot day is perfectly fine&lt;/b&gt;. “It doesn’t really matter what temperature of water you drink while you’re sweating, because your body compensates for the ingested thermal load or sink enough to maintain core temperature,” said Nathan Morris, an assistant professor in human physiology and nutrition at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He encourages people to drink whatever water temperature they find palatable to encourage greater fluid intake. If it’s humid outside or you’re exercising to the point that you’re dripping with sweat (meaning, it’s no longer evaporating efficiently), it makes the most sense to stick to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/25/drink-water-cold-temperature/" target="_blank"&gt;cooler drinks&lt;/a&gt;. But if the situation that describes you best this summer is taking an afternoon break at your local cafe in a cute breezy dress, then don’t be embarrassed: Order that hot espresso.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wear loose, breathable clothing like linen.&lt;/b&gt; Tighter and less breathable fabrics keep your sweat from evaporating easily — and remember, it’s the evaporation process that draws heat away from your body, not the sweat itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try wrapping ice in a damp towel and placing it on your neck&lt;/b&gt;. Applying an ice towel to the neck helps you lose heat via conduction and has been shown to reduce heat strain in certain conditions — namely, doing it in short bursts (for one to two minutes) and then repeating about every 10 minutes. Some of the strongest data supporting this comes from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28647283/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; done during the Australian Open showing that among tennis players, the fan plus skin-wetting combination as well as the ice-towel method both effectively cooled body temperature by a full degree while reducing heart strain. There is a caveat, though: Kenny advises caution for older adults. In adults over age 65, this method may not actually &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10739084/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce strain&lt;/a&gt; on their hearts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-video" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div data-qa="article-video" data-testid="article-video" class="ma-auto"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="wpds-c-gPjxah mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print flex flex-column items-center ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mb-md"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="orca-wrapper" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-ikRUBWG-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="mt-xs mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns left font--subhead font-xxxs gray-dark square-vertical-video" data-qa="video-caption"&gt;Ask A Doctor columnist Trisha Pasricha describes how she packs fiber into her daily diet, from overnight oats in the morning to kiwis at night.

Over 20 years ago, the National Academy of Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; women and men drink around 9-13 cups a day, respectively. At least eight cups a day is a rule of thumb that many people have heard, which probably stems from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692653/" target="_blank"&gt;misinterpretation&lt;/a&gt; of a 1945 recommendation from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council. A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/eight-cups-daily-water-intake/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Science in 2022 found that eight cups per day was unnecessary for most adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LLGR25BOQZFTHFKVIT3WLCF2VQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s reasonable to aim for around that much, but the most common-sense advice is to drink when you’re thirsty, prioritize water over sugary beverages, and, of course, pay extra attention to your increased needs in hot weather. If you’re doing intense exercise or reaching the point of dehydration, electrolyte-containing drinks can be helpful, but if you feel dizzy or light-headed, seek prompt medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-raw_html" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-cbTFcs wpds-c-cbTFcs-iPJLV-css" data-qa="raw-html"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/b&gt;Dr. Anna Wolfson says she sees dangerous misuse of the allergy medication diphenhydramine in her clinic every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If someone has an allergic reaction to a food, people will say, ‘Don’t worry, I have diphenhydramine in my purse,’ and I would say, ‘Really, epinephrine is the first-line treatment for food allergies,’” said Wolfson, an allergist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diphenhydramine can be harmful if people take it after having an allergic reaction to food, she said, because the drug – best known by the brand name Benadryl – makes them drowsy and can cause them to miss signs that their symptoms are getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to move on. For every single indication that people are using diphenhydramine, there are better drugs that are more effective at treating the symptoms people are trying to treat with fewer side effects,” she said. “I’ve had patients where I worried that diphenhydramine was impairing their ability to drive or fully participate in their daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfson isn’t alone in preferring alternatives. In a &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; published in February, allergy experts from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San Diego called for the removal of diphenhydramine from over-the-counter and prescription markets in the United States, saying it’s outdated, dangerous and eclipsed by safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first-generation antihistamine approved in 1946, diphenhydramine is widely used for allergies, sleep aid and cold symptoms. It’s a common over-the-counter medication in the US, with usage rising in the summer months as people use it to treat itching from bug bites or poison ivy, as well as sneezing and runny nose caused by grass and pollen allergies, according to the American Pharmacists Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its longstanding presence in American homes, the authors of the new review say it poses disproportionate risks, especially for children and older adults, than newer antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Patients should trial alternatives agents like loratadine, which is Claritin, or cetirizine, which is Zyrtec, or fexofenadine, which is Allegra,” to alleviate allergy symptoms, Dr. James Clark of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the lead author of the paper, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents the OTC medicine industry, says that common side effects associated with products containing diphenhydramine are disclosed on the label. However, it notes, “these products are not intended for long-term use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When used as directed, these medicines provide well-established therapeutic benefits for common health ailments like allergies, the common cold, motion sickness, minor skin irritations, and occasional sleeplessness,” the group said in a statement on behalf of Benadryl’s maker, Kenvue. “Like all medicines, responsible use is essential, and consumers should always follow directions and warnings on the Drug Facts labels and consult healthcare providers if they have questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Risks of diphenhydramine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking receptors called H1, part of the body’s system for responding to allergens, which trigger symptoms like sneezing, itching and a runny nose. But older drugs like diphenhydramine don’t just block the allergy-related receptors, they can also affect other parts of the brain. Diphenhydramine often causes sedation, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, dangerous cardiac effects, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In older adults, the drug can stay in the body for up to 18 hours, resulting in lingering sleepiness, disorientation and increasing risk of falling. The review also highlighted a possible link between long-term diphenhydramine use and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621434/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In children, the risks can be even more pronounced. The review’s authors cite cases of accidental overdose; paradoxical reactions such as agitation, extreme sedation and coma; and even death, particularly with pediatric formulations, because of accidental ingestions. The medication was linked to several child hospitalizations and fatalities during the viral &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/benadryl-tiktok-challenge-teen-death-wellness"&gt;“Benadryl Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manuela Murray, director of general pediatrics and urgent care at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says diphenhydramine “should not be used lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It should always be used under the guidance of a Medical Professional, and it is only indicated to treat allergic reactions and motion sickness,” Murray wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medication is often misused and “doesn’t offer a benefit for treatment of cold symptoms, and it is not a safe sleep aid medication,” she said. In fact, it can have the opposite effects in children, leading to hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alyssa Kuban, a pediatrician and associate medical director at Texas Children’s Pediatrics, also said that she finds diphenhydramine overused for symptoms it does not directly treat and that there are safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see some families use diphenhydramine when the child has a cold or upper respiratory infection, thinking it will help with the congestion and help them to sleep better at night,” she said. “This is not effective for cold symptoms, nor is it very safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recommends over-the-counter cetirizine to treat children with hives, seasonal allergies or an itchy rash. Cetirizine is also longer-lasting and not as sedating as diphenhydramine, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murray agrees that loratadine and cetirizine are safer for children over 6 months, and saline drops and suctioning are better alternatives for infants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‘Time to say a final goodbye’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diphenhydramine appears in over 300 OTC formulations, often blended into combination products for coughs, colds and flu. The authors of the review say that, like products with pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine should at minimum be moved behind the counter, allowing pharmacists to guide patients toward second-generation alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Pharmacists Association says patients should use caution with combination cough and cold products that contain diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists may recommend alternative medications for older adults who have a history of being cognitively affected by certain medications, the group says, and it “encourages patients and parents/caregivers to ask their pharmacist for the most appropriate treatment recommendation for their symptoms” with the least amount of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review authors also emphasize that there is no strong clinical data that may suggest that diphenhydramine works better than other options. Although it may reduce symptoms like sneezing and itching, it has minimal effect on nasal congestion and doesn’t outperform second-generation drugs in randomized trials. Newer options, such as oral cetirizine, offer 24-hour coverage with fewer adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the US, the medication remains a staple. According to the review, more than 1.5 million prescriptions are still written annually, not counting untracked OTC purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the past, it has been a useful medication that has helped millions of patients; however, its current therapeutic ratio is matched or exceeded by second-generation antihistamines, especially due to their markedly reduced adverse reactions. It is time to say a final goodbye to diphenhydramine, a public health hazard,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if particles don't slow down in a crowd, but move faster? Physicists from Leiden worked together and discovered a new state of matter, where particles pass on energy through collisions and create more movement when packed closely together.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;We all know crowds of people, or cars in a traffic jam—when it gets too crowded, all you can do is stand still. Until now, scientists have mainly studied cases of large groups just like this, which slow down when they get too close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the opposite happens? What if &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/particles/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; could start moving more when packed together? That question hadn't been studied much—until now. Physicists Marine Le Blay, Joshua Saldi and Alexandre Morin from Leiden University do research in the field of active matter physics—they observe and analyze the collective behaviors that emerge when large groups of particles are packed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02957-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metal beads and electrodes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, Morin, Le Blay and Saldi worked with tiny, non-moving particles: one-millimeter metal beads, placed between two glass plates. "These two plates holding the beads are not just simple glass plates; they are also electrodes. Our beads can't move by themselves, but when we charge them with electricity, they start to jump up and down. They travel back and forth between the two &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/glass+plates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glass plates&lt;/a&gt; extremely fast, around 100 times in 1 second. This way, we give energy to our system of beads," Saldi explains. The Fine Mechanical Department of the Science Faculty helped them create this creative lab setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morin adds, "While the beads move around, we take 300 to 400 images per second with our high-speed camera. We then make slow-motion videos of these images to discover in detail what is happening. We link every particle from one image to the next and make precise statistics of the movements observed. One afternoon of experimenting can fill up an entire hard drive. We use a strong computer and an efficient analysis routine to do this work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Moving as a group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only a few beads in the experiment, the beads stay in place—nothing surprising yet. When the researchers increased the number of beads to hundreds and thousands, something very surprising happened: the beads started moving around wildly. They formed a very dynamic and disordered system, which we call an 'active gas' state of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? The researchers watched and analyzed the movement patterns and discovered that the particles bump into each other in a very special way. Their collisions are super elastic. Instead of losing energy like a bouncing ball eventually coming to rest, they pass energy on to each other during these bumps, which triggers more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/movement/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt;. So, the more particles there are, the more collisions happen—and the more active the whole system becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Controlling the movement patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once we understood how these packed particles power up, we realized that we could even control the collective behavior of the metal &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/beads/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;beads&lt;/a&gt;," Morin explains. "To do so, instead of powering the particles continuously, we powered them intermittently by switching the electric field on and off. We observed that the faster the switching, the slower the movements. But more importantly, the structure of the group also changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, we could obtain structures analogous to the three well-known states of matter: gas, liquid, and crystal—by simply turning a knob on our &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/power+generator/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;power generator&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Why this discovery matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morin says, "This is an important discovery, because it reveals that there are still many unknown ways in which particles can organize themselves." This opens the door to new types of behavior in particle systems, with possible applications in technology, biology, and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/materials+science/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;materials science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the research is still in an early stage, Morin thinks this discovery could help create new smart materials in the future. Living things can do many things—like remembering, growing, healing, and processing information—that normal materials like fabric or steel cannot do. This research shows how simple active materials can change their shape and patterns on their own. A step towards better designed and more advanced man-made materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Barley can help lower LDL cholesterol because it’s rich in a special kind of fiber called beta-glucan. This fiber forms a thick gel in your gut that traps cholesterol and helps your body get rid of it. Studies show that eating barley every day can lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adding barley to your meals regularly is a simple, natural way to support healthier cholesterol levels.

Eating salmon and other fatty fish reduces levels of triglycerides (fat) in blood that contribute to clogged arteries. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish like salmon at least twice per week for heart-healthy benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swapping out fatty meat for fish can reduce LDL cholesterol by lowering your intake of saturated fat, which increases blood cholesterol concentrations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Other fish that contain higher amounts of omega-3s, such as mackerel, tuna and sardines, can also help.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oatmeal is one of the best cholesterol-fighting foods because it's so &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-upgrade-to-add-to-your-smoothies-8786724" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in beta-glucans&lt;/a&gt;, the soluble fibers that cause oats to bulk up in liquid when you make oatmeal. Soluble fiber forms a gel in your gut that binds cholesterol and blocks its absorption through the intestinal wall, thus lowering LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prepare &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269639/old-fashioned-oatmeal/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;old-fashioned oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; on the stove or in the microwave and skip the instant packs with lots of added sugar and less fiber. Add fruit to your oatmeal to naturally sweeten it and boost the soluble fiber content even more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many fruits contain soluble fiber, which is important for lowering cholesterol, but apples have a leg up on other fruits. Apples (especially the skins) contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber that latches onto the "bad" cholesterol and guides it through your digestive system and out of your body,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; effectively lowering your LDL-cholesterol levels. Citrus fruits are also high in pectin, but since it's mostly in the pulp, you'll have to eat your fruits to get the benefits, rather than juice them. Luckily, apples are a little easier to pucker up to than lemons. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-fruit-to-eat-to-help-lower-your-cholesterol-11772297" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apples are also high in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, powerful antioxidants that help reduce inflammation.

Beans are packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/underrated-nutrient-for-heart-health-11732192" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-busting soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, but that's not their only benefit. Beans are high in protein and have nearly no saturated fat, which makes them a heart-healthy replacement for animal protein sources, such as meat. For the biggest cholesterol-lowering benefits, add beans to chili, tacos and burritos (either in place of or in addition to meat). They're also great in soups and salads.

Nuts also contain plant sterols, which are natural compounds that help block the cholesterol you eat from entering your bloodstream. While nuts are awesome to eat, don't go overboard. Portion control is still important—there are about 170 calories in just 1 ounce of almonds (about 1/4 cup).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add a small handful to oatmeal, top toast with nut butter or make a DIY trail mix with dried fruit and nuts.

They not only taste amazing but also can help lower your cholesterol as part of a balanced diet. One study found that over the course of 30 years, people who ate the most avocado had a 21% lower risk for heart disease than those who ate none.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocados are high in healthy monounsaturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, which helps lower "bad" LDL cholesterol. They also contain fiber, antioxidants and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol, which have also been shown to lower cholesterol. Don't hog the entire bowl of guacamole, though! One serving is just a quarter of an avocado, which delivers 57 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Spread a few slices of avocado on your sandwich instead of mayo, or dip some veggies into a bowl of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261795/almost-chipotles-guacamole/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fresh guacamole&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate fans rejoice! You might have heard that chocolate is good for you, and it's true. According to research, dark chocolate and cocoa powder contain powerful antioxidant compounds called flavonoids, which help lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Milk chocolate has less cocoa solids, and thus lower flavonoid levels, and white chocolate has none. Reach for small portions of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-chocolate-11760050" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, preferably with a high cocoa content (try 70% or higher).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no magic food for cholesterol, but fiber, healthy fats and antioxidants can help. Eating more plant-based foods, swapping out saturated fat and adding fermented foods may raise HDL and lower LDL—supporting long-term heart health. Salmon, oatmeal, beans and avocado are just a few of our favorite picks for supporting healthy cholesterol levels.

And some recent studies show that it's having major impacts on moms' mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while millennial mothers are definitely struggling, Gen Z moms are finding parenthood even more challenging than their older counterparts, especially when it comes to some key issues modern parents face. There's no shortage of online discourse about the overwhelming load of parenting and especially motherhood these days, and recent data shows it is wreaking havoc on moms' mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by Columbia University and the University of Michigan, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834318" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;released in May,&lt;/a&gt; tracked nearly 200,000 mothers from 2016 to 2023 and had some startling findings. In 2016, 1 in 20 mothers rated their mental health as "poor;" by 2023, that had skyrocketed to 1 in 12. Dads, on the other hand, were doing much better: Just 1 in 22 rated their mental health as "poor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the isolation of the pandemic was part of the picture, researchers found that it was bigger, more long-standing problems like the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/mom-hit-breaking-point-after-husband-forgot-feed-toddler"&gt;unequal workload between moms and dads&lt;/a&gt;, lack of adequate parental leave, economic uncertainty, and soaring costs that were the main reasons for the steep decline in maternal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/signs-raised-type-c-mom"&gt;6 Signs You Were Raised By A Type C Mom Who Silently Struggled But Obviously Cared With All Her Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most moms feel pressure to be the 'perfect' parent, but it's hitting Gen Z hardest.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/gen-z-millennials-perfect-parent" rel="nofollow"&gt;survey conducted by parenting website What To Expect&lt;/a&gt; gives Columbia and U of M's findings even more context. After polling more than 3,200 moms, What To Expect found that while this parenting anxiety is hitting both millennials and Gen Z moms hard, it's taking a larger toll on Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/seven-things-gen-z-moms-worry-about-more-than-millennials-perfect.png" alt="overwhelmed mom" title="seven things gen z moms worry about more than millennials perfect" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gustavo Fring | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge proportions of moms said they feel &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/ways-younger-generations-overparent-kids"&gt;pressured to be the "perfect" parent&lt;/a&gt;, a thing that, of course, does not exist. Nevertheless, 83% of Gen Z moms said they're striving for a perfect 10 motherhood score, compared to 77% of millennials. And when it comes to the various attributes that supposedly make up the "perfect" mom, Gen Z is struggling with all but two of them more than their millennial counterparts, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Keeping kids busy with lots of activities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern trend of kids having to be constantly occupied, rather than being left to play and explore solo, is hitting Gen Z moms quite a bit harder than millennials: 48% versus 34%, showing a marked difference in how much time and energy Gen Zers are requiring themselves to spend entertaining and engaging their little ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensuring kids have plenty of free time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sure kids have as much open-ended time for all those activities is a huge concern, too, and it's stressing out 39% of Gen Z moms, compared to 30% of millennial moms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Ensuring tech-free time for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the good old screen time debate rears its head once again. And while all moms are worried about their &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/dad-makes-kids-complete-to-do-list-before-screen-time"&gt;kids spending too much time&lt;/a&gt;, What to Expect found it's surprisingly an even larger worry for the "digital natives" of Gen Z: 50% versus 41% of millennials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/seven-things-gen-z-moms-worry-about-more-than-millennials-perfect-tech-free.png" alt="mom having tech-free time with child" title="seven things gen z moms worry about more than millennials tech free" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Kampus Production | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Managing the planning, scheduling, and coordination for the family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, the often-forgotten part of the unequal load moms tend to bear when it comes to the work of running the home and managing the children. It's not just the vacuuming and diaper changes, but the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/woman-explains-what-mental-load-dads-who-do-bare-minimum"&gt;mental work involved in keeping the family running&lt;/a&gt; as well. Once again, Gen Z is struggling more than millennials, 51% versus 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Being open to child(ren) exploring their own identity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millennials were perhaps the pioneers of letting kids simply discover who they are rather than placing cultural, social, or religious expectations on them, like previous generations. But for Gen Z, which is even more forward-thinking about these issues than their millennials siblings, the pressure is more intense, with 53% worrying about this versus 45% of millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/millennial-mom-reveals-lazy-gen-z-habits"&gt;Millennial Mom Reveals 6 'Lazy' Gen-Z Habits That Drive Her Absolutely Bonkers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Prioritizing family over themselves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have arguably the biggest factor in moms' declining mental health, and it seems millennial moms are a lot better at &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-set-much-needed-boundary-without-saying-single-word"&gt;setting boundaries&lt;/a&gt; and making room for self-care than Gen Z moms are: 33% of millennial moms reported struggling with this, versus 41% of Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Teaching kids to adapt easily to setbacks and difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising adaptable, resilient kids is a huge priority these days, but it's even more so for Gen Z moms. One of the consistent issues that mental health experts have noticed with Gen Zers as they reach adulthood is a tendency toward anxiety likely caused, at least in part, by their parents having done too much for them and eroded their opportunities to learn from mistakes and grow in self-sufficiency. So it's perhaps unsurprising that nearly two-thirds of Gen Z moms worry about instilling this in their own children, versus 58% of millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some experts believe this added stress is related to Gen Z growing up with social media scrutiny.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent such an enormous proportion of their lives with the internet being commonplace, Gen Zers have essentially grown up in a fishbowl, coming of age on social media in an environment that is often described as a sort of panopticon: Everyone is watching everyone, and no one can get away with anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sheri Lusskin, a perinatal psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Medical Center and member of the What to Expect Medical Review Board, said this is likely part of why Gen Z moms are struggling so much more than millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Younger parents who have grown up in the age of social media are used to having their every move discussed and critiqued, and that's no different for parenting," she told What to Expect. "It's consistent with people living in a world of social media, where their every gesture is recorded and shared, and every behavior elicits a comment from someone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does social media seem to be making Gen Z moms more anxious, but it also seems to be eroding the thing that many moms told What to Expect is among their biggest problems: the decline of the "village" that moms have always relied on for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom-shaming has been a thing for as long as mother has, of course, but it's on a whole other level today. And Dr. Lusskin says the key to navigating it is remembering one essential truth: Perfection isn't real. "You don't have to be perfect — you have to be good enough," Dr. Lusskin said. And with all we know about parenting these days compared to earlier generations, "good enough" is already far better than it ever used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/mom-sick-parents-not-parenting-because-afraid-traumatize-kids"&gt;Mom ‘Sick’ Of Parents Not Really Parenting Anymore Because They’re Too Afraid To Traumatize Their Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Sundholm is a writer, editor, and video personality with 20 years of experience in media and entertainment.

    &lt;p&gt;As more people aged 45-49 are getting screened for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-what-millennials-need-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, more early stage diagnoses are being made, according to new research from the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in two studies Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed increases in screenings among those younger than 50 is linked to rises in earlier diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837232" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed an annual increase of 1.1% from 2004 to 2019 jumped to 12% from 2019 to 2022 for colorectal cancer incidence among people aged 45 to 49, while &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837231" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; showed screenings among U.S. adults aged 45 to 49 increase 62% from 2019 to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended age to begin &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-younger-adults-rates-rise-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;colorectal screening was lowered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and by the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/early-diagnosis-surge-for-CRC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; Monday, Elizabeth Schafer, lead author and surveillance and health equity scientist, called the findings "promising news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The uptick of cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier," Schafer explained. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lead author, Jessica Star, who does cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the ACS, said it's "thrilling" to see increases in screening rates among younger adults as well as its likely ties into rises in earlier stage diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she warned there's a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening for colorectal caner in ages 45-49 remains suboptimal and has not increased equitably by both education attainment and insurance status," Star said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, medical associations expressed concern after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;may remove all members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, recently told CBS News that a change like this would "greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning — and doing the opposite of making America healthy," Lew said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to CBS News at the time, an HHS spokesperson said, "No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;

The next, she can't remember where she is or who you are, her words are garbled, and she can’t summon the name of the vegetable she just started slicing. “You might think, well, maybe she's just tired,” says Dr. Yanina Purim-Shem-Tov, executive vice chair of emergency medicine with the Rush University System for Health at Rush University Medical Center. “But this is absolutely an emergency, and we should see these people right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudden confusion or a personality change could indicate a stroke, an infection like sepsis, or low blood sugar, she adds, which is why it’s essential to seek immediate care at the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unusual upper back pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always pay attention to severe pain in your upper back or between your shoulder blades, especially if it comes on suddenly or is accompanied by other symptoms like nausea or dizziness. “Don’t shrug it off,” Purim-Shem-Tov says. “Call 911. It could be a sign of a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7285524/when-to-go-emergency-room-vs-urgent-care/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:When to Go to the Emergency Room vs. Urgent Care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;When to Go to the Emergency Room vs. Urgent Care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people—&lt;a href="https://time.com/5168411/women-heart-attack-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;including women&lt;/a&gt;—heart attack pain shows up in surprising places, like the back, neck, or jaw. Purim-Shem-Tov’s patients often describe it as a “tearing pain” that sometimes radiates down one or both arms. This kind of pain could also be a sign of aortic dissection, or tearing in the aorta, which is the main artery carrying blood from the heart. While people sometimes try to endure it at home, convinced they simply pulled a muscle, “this is not that,” she says, “especially in patients who are at risk—for example, those who have hypertension and suddenly have this severe upper back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden, unexplained severe itching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can't stop scratching—especially if you itch all over instead of in just one spot—you could be experiencing the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction. “When somebody feels really itchy and uncomfortable, and all of a sudden they start to get flushed, that’s really concerning,” says Dr. David Benaron, vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. “I would want them to come see us ASAP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://time.com/7304016/alcohol-allergy-how-to-tell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How to Tell if You’re Allergic to Alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Tell if You’re Allergic to Alcohol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming: if your symptoms are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. People often don't realize it, but digestive distress is a pillar of anaphylaxis, Benaron says. “You eat something and all of a sudden you're like, ‘Oh God, I'm terribly nauseated,’” he says. “You can get hives inside your gastrointestinal tract, and it becomes really irritated and you get these GI symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomit that’s a certain color&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color of your vomit can tell ER doctors a lot about how sick you are. Benaron is especially inclined to worry when children throw up bile, which is usually green, because “that can indicate a really dangerous obstruction in their intestines," he says. Meanwhile, if your throw-up looks like coffee grounds—it’s dark brown or even black—it might include blood that’s been partially digested by stomach acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vomit that resembles coffee grounds “would mean to me that there's some bleeding,” Benaron says. Red vomit, however, triggers even louder alarm bells, because such a bright color indicates “there’s quite a lot of blood moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sense of doom &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When extreme anxiety strikes out of nowhere, take it seriously—especially if it’s accompanied by trouble breathing, a racing heart, or dizziness. It could be the body’s reaction to a heart attack or blood clot, or a severe allergic reaction. “If it’s new, intense, or feels different than usual anxiety, don’t ignore it,” Purim-Shem-Tov says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7297776/anxiety-stress-how-to-cope/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Difference Between Stress and Anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Difference Between Stress and Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Christmas a few years ago, for example, Purim-Shem-Tov treated a 31-year-old patient who showed up at the ER pacing back and forth, overcome with anxiety and a sense of dread. “He wasn't really complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath,” she recalls. “All he was feeling was this doom sensation—he &lt;a href="https://time.com/7208914/symptoms-doctors-dismiss-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:thought it was anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;thought it was anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.” The man ended up experiencing a massive, fatal heart attack, which drives home why it’s important to take extreme anxiety seriously, Purim-Shem-Tov says, especially if it’s out of character for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomly passing out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting or almost fainting without a clear cause can be a red flag for abnormal heart rhythms, internal bleeding, or neurological issues. That said, it could also be the result of dehydration or standing up too fast. “Dizziness or lightheadedness is probably the bane of every emergency physician's existence,” Purim-Shem-Tov says, since it’s such a vague, imprecise symptom that can point to a wide spectrum of possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7093682/weird-endocrinology-symptoms-thyroid-diabetes-acromegaly-pituitary-glands/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:12 Weird Symptoms Endocrinologists Say You Should Never Ignore;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Weird Symptoms Endocrinologists Say You Should Never Ignore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why she advises always getting fainting checked out, especially if it happens while you’re sitting or lying down, working out, or experiencing other unusual symptoms. As frustrating as it can be to encounter something as ambiguous as dizziness, “we also know that we need to be looking for something serious,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White poop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re having white bowel movements, it’s possible your bile tract could be obstructed, meaning bile—which contributes to the normal color of stool—isn't reaching the intestines. “The scary thing that does that is pancreatic cancer,” Benaron says. “The pancreas wraps around the bile system and the bile builds up, causing yellow in the eyes and white-colored stools.” It’s worth bringing up with your doctor or at the ER as soon as you notice the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urinary retention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People sometimes go to the ER for constipation sooner than they need to—after three or four days of not being able to go to the bathroom, before they’ve tried reliable remedies like stool softeners, Benaron says. But there is one clear sign that constipation needs to be addressed urgently: you’ve stopped being able to pee. A full, impacted bowel “can cause bladder obstruction because, anatomically, it can press a lot in that pelvic region,” he says. “If somebody’s not urinating, that's a big problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7260509/weird-dermatology-symptoms-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:12 Weird Symptoms Dermatologists Say You Should Never Ignore;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Weird Symptoms Dermatologists Say You Should Never Ignore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when ER doctors treat constipation by manually removing stool from the rectum, the patient resumes being able to pee again on their own. Other times, however, “you need to put a catheter in their urethra to drain the bladder,” he says. Not resolving the matter in a timely manner can ultimately lead to &lt;a href="https://time.com/6303020/chronic-kidney-disease-climate-change/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;, Benaron adds, so don’t delay seeking care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath while lying down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming short of breath while you’re lying down or resting isn’t the same as feeling winded while you’re climbing 10 flights of stairs. Gasping for air when you’re horizontal could signal heart failure, a blood clot in the lungs, or a &lt;a href="https://time.com/6228366/diabetes-silent-heart-attacks-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silent heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;silent heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, Purim-Shem-Tov says. “Your lungs could be filling up with fluid, and when you lay back, it's almost like you're drowning in your own fluids,” she says. “Shortness of breath at rest is just as important—or maybe even more important—than shortness of breath when you're exerting yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg pain or swelling in one leg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing leg pain or swelling in just one leg, and if it’s also red, warm, or painful, you could have deep vein thrombosis, which requires urgent treatment. That blood clot could break loose and travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are at increased risk include those on hormone therapy or hormonal birth control, smokers, travelers who recently completed a long flight, pregnant women, those with a history of cancer, and people who recently underwent a medical procedure. “There are things we can do to diagnose and intervene immediately," Purim-Shem-Tov says. “This is something that's treatable, so we should not delay treatment and evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%2010%20Symptoms%20ER%20Doctors%20Say%20to%20Never%20Ignore&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7307026%2Fwhen-to-go-emergency-room-symptoms%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:43:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBDeTZyVHhMTEpjV1Z6bmR4N1pNeG5pLXZwR2l5c251dXVEWnl2OWU3QkZJcjZnZlJmQTFFcTdLY2ZGN3I2azlhZEg4bDN6UEdPTnVDZmxWbHRISnBDeGx1dDRodGRCSE4wcW82eV93NDI</guid></item><item><title>这名男子没有任何症状表明他破裂的牙齿被感染了。随后，他被诊断出患有危及生命的脑脓肿- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTFBHcFY0QmU5OXJqRnE0WEVEX1ZCYkRDcWxFWVZFLVlHcHZvOUZfclZjZkdqZV9HVk1Ka1ByY19SVlhDcHNhYzg1UE5OeW1mU2RzQjRfNk5RTURWbmlQV0k5Y2R4LVFjMWxNZTdTRWNWT3ltaUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walton Centre/Bell Family&lt;/p&gt; Graham Bell&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Bell, 61, opened up about being diagnosed with a life-threatening brain abscess, which he contracted via a cracked tooth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wound up having a "life-saving brain surgery," after "a mass in [his] brain was discovered" in mid-March&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was bizarre because I had no pain or swelling in my mouth to tell me there was something wrong," he recalled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A British man is speaking out about being diagnosed with a life-threatening brain abscess after a crack in his tooth became infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Bell, 61, and his wife Sue, who are based in Wirral in the north west of England, were preparing to head to Wales for the day when he started complaining of bad headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue also noticed Graham's face "had fallen on one side," per a &lt;a href="https://www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/news/tooth-infection-led-to-lifethreatening-brain-abscess-but-surgical-intervention-from-the-walton-centre-saved-grahams-life-1816" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; shared by The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, which is the hospital in Liverpool, U.K., where he was treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stroke was ruled out, but Graham ended up having "life-saving brain surgery," after "a mass in [his] brain was discovered" in the days that followed. The hospital confirmed in an email to PEOPLE that Graham underwent the operation in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walton Centre/Bell Family&lt;/p&gt; Graham Bell&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalled, “It was a lot of information to take in a short time. I had the family around me, but I think we were all in a bit of shock. I was not well, so finding out what was going on quickly was key for all of us," per the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham's wife, Sue, said, “By this point Graham had deteriorated greatly. The ambulance brought us to The Walton Centre, and once there I knew it was serious," the post noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Graham was prepped for surgery right away. The team was so professional, but it was obvious that speed was of the essence," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 3 centimeter abscess was discovered in Graham's brain as he was admitted for emergency surgery, the release stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first operation to essentially drain the abscess was a success, and Graham began to improve," the hospital noted, adding that his condition worsened days later after he contracted sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walton Centre/Bell Family&lt;/p&gt; Graham Bell with his family&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12361-sepsis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; states that "sepsis occurs when your immune system has a dangerous reaction to an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It causes extensive inflammation throughout your body that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and even death," the site adds. "Many different kinds of infections can trigger sepsis, which is a medical emergency. The quicker you receive treatment, the better your outcome will be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham recalled, “I was rushed back into surgery to drain the abscess again and they gave me high doses of [antibiotics] to help tackle the infection," per the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My clinical team worked to understand what was going on, and found that the infection had actually come from an infection in a cracked tooth I had.

However, some people may still be unclear about what “quality sleep” entails and what impact sleep really has on their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Until] now we have not completely understood how sleep builds our health,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qing-Chen-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Qing Chen&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, associate professor at the Institute of Toxicology in the College of Preventive Medicine at the Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University) in China, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe we only know that sleep deprivation is harmful. No scientist has 100% confidence to tell us when we should sleep or when we should not sleep, [or] whether there are additional sleep tips that are important for health,“ said Chen. “This is not enough to make a really healthy sleep schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chen is the co-lead author of a study recently published in the journal &lt;a href="https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/hds.0161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has linked 172 different diseases to poor sleep patterns.

For example, some groups may benefit from having a longer sleep duration. Others may benefit from having a more regular sleep schedule.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For next steps in this research, Scharf said the key piece would be to see if targeted interventions improve outcomes in each patient population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in patients with Parkinson’s disease, would a program that promoted a regular bedtime routine improve Parkinson’s disease-related symptoms or quality of life metrics?” he asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/daniel-d-truong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel Truong&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a neurologist and medical director of the Truong Neuroscience Institute at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA and editor in chief of the Journal of Clinical Parkinsonism and Related Disorders&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; who was not involved in the recent study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that his reaction to this study’s findings was one of surprising clarity: Sleep regularity matters more than sleep duration in explaining disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ‘good sleep’ mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was struck by how decisive rhythm, and regularity came across in this analysis — almost redefining what ‘good sleep’ means. It suggests that behavioral interventions focused on consistency and timing may offer health benefits beyond just aiming for a fixed number of hours.” &lt;br&gt;— Daniel Truong, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is crucial for researchers to continue investigating how sleep affects overall health because sleep is a foundational biological process that influences nearly every organ system — and yet it remains one of the most underappreciated and misunderstood contributors to disease risk and health maintenance,” Truong continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This recent study underscores why this research must continue. Unlike genetic predispositions or aging, sleep habits can be changed. Sleep affects multiple biological systems such as [the] immune system, endocrine, cardiovascular, [and] neurological problems,” he said. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/216527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Katie S. McCullar&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that this research reinforces the idea that sleep is not just a passive state but a vital process that supports nearly every aspect of health, and adds to a growing body of research that demonstrates that healthy sleep is one of the foundational determinants of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCullar, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, this work highlights what is often observed in a clinical setting: That inadequate sleep is rarely an isolated issue, but rather an indicator or exacerbating factor in a wide range of chronic conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is encouraging to see more scientific evidence linking sleep quality and duration to physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The data provide empirical support for the need to integrate sleep health more thoroughly into preventive and therapeutic care models,” she added. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep has historically been underemphasized in both clinical training and public health initiatives,” she continued. “Continued research helps us understand the mechanisms behind these connections, allowing us to develop more effective and targeted interventions to prevent and treat diseases. Further, the integration of sleep health into broader frameworks of lifestyle medicine and health equity research is especially timely and warranted.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the many adults experiencing sleep issues, you’re not alone. Previous research shows that about &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35659072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;10% of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; around the world live with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and about 20% experience occasional insomnia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to improve their nightly sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jimmy-johannes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jimmy Johannes&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care medicine specialist at MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, suggested setting a regular bedtime and keeping the sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Synchronizing with the day-night cycle by exposing yourself to some sunlight in the daytime and keeping lighting dim near bedtime can help prepare the brain for sleep at night,” Johannes continued.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Talk to your doctor about persistent difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, loud snoring or gasping during sleep, waking up tired in the morning, and/or excessive daytime fatigue or sleepiness.

&lt;p&gt;However, in the long term, mobility difficulties may significantly reduce adherence to physical activity, a lifestyle factor that may impact patients’ outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adherence to healthy habits appears to be associated with fewer &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and slowed disease progression, according to the study. These include eating a high-quality diet, taking vitamin D supplements, engaging in physical activity and meditation, and not smoking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Determining barriers and facilitators for long-term adherence to healthy lifestyle may inform efforts to support [people living with MS] improve lifestyle engagement,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(25)00357-8/abstract"&gt;Self-reported symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis do not impact five-year adherence to healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS patients with fatigue more likely to be women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the immune system mistakenly attacking the myelin sheath, the protective layer around nerve fibers that enables efficient transmission of electrical signals. This damage leads to progressive nerve degeneration and the onset of MS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who adhere to a healthy lifestyle, including a high-quality diet, stress management, and regular physical activity, appear to have fewer disease symptoms, slowed disease progression, and better quality of life, according to the study. However, MS symptoms may prevent long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further explore this connection, researchers at the University of Melbourne in Australia conducted an observational study using patients’ self-reported health and lifestyle data obtained from the&lt;a href="https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/neuroepidemiology/the-holism-study"&gt; Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of people with MS&lt;/a&gt; study. Nearly 2,500 participants were recruited online and detailed information was collected on their demographics, disease status, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 671 participants, the majority of whom were women (81%) and had a mean age of 46 years, were included in the analysis. The three most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue (43%), mobility issues (35%), and cognitive impairment (24%), determined at the five-year follow-up. Almost all patients reporting these three symptoms were non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with fatigue were more likely to be women, to have more than one coexistent condition, and to have clinically meaningful fatigue and use anti-fatigue medications.  Those with mobility issues were more likely to be older than 58 years and have an MS diagnosis for over 10 years, progressive MS, moderate to severe disability, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of patients reporting cognitive impairment was more likely to have depression and take antidepressant medications, and less likely to have progressive MS and moderate to severe disability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Physical activity declines for participants with mobility issues as top symptom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the five-year assessment, participants experiencing fatigue were 27% less likely to engage in physical activities and 18% less likely to commit to at least three lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with MS who said mobility was their main symptom were 29% more likely to take vitamin D supplements and 28% less likely to be physically active. However, only the link with lower physical activity stayed true over time. Individuals reporting cognitive issues were 25% less likely to follow a healthy diet, however, this association was also not maintained over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes were also observed at the 7.5-year follow-up, with a 37% increase in the proportion of patients taking vitamin D supplementation, a 19% increase for those engaging in at least three lifestyle factors, and a 9% increase for meditation. The proportion of individuals engaging in physical activity decreased by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;These symptoms, except for mobility with physical activity, were not barriers to engagement with healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analysis at the 7.5-year follow-up was extended to the most important symptom, the only association that persisted was between mobility issues and reduced likelihood of physical activity, though an association was also found between cognitive function and an increased likelihood of being a non-smoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These symptoms, except for mobility with physical activity, were not barriers to engagement with healthy lifestyle,” the researchers wrote. “While lifestyle modifications can benefit health outcomes in [people living with MS], it is important to discuss symptoms most relevant to the individual and how lifestyle modifications may be adapted to accommodate change in health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A new study suggests it may be sooner than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied proteins in tissue taken from about 70 people ages 14 to 68, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00749-4?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867425007494?showall=true" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00749-4?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867425007494?showall=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the study published July 25 in the journal Cell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These proteins give scientists a window of when the aging process may begin on a cellular level, said Dr. Thomas Blackwell, associate dean for graduate medical education and professor of medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Proteins are created in a “factory” using instructions from messenger RNA, he said. A sign of aging is when the cells’ ability to make proteins correctly and efficiently starts to break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By looking at tissues taken from organs throughout the body, including the heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, skin and muscles, researchers determined that aging starts to accelerate from 45 to 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They also found that organs aged at different rates. For example, the spleen, aorta (the body’s main artery) and adrenal gland (responsible for producing hormones) showed signs of aging at around 30. The aorta also saw the biggest changes in protein levels around the ages of 45 and 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This is just a beautiful roadmap that gives us an initial overview of organ aging,” said Neville Sanjana, associate professor of biology, neuroscience and physiology at New York University and a faculty member at the New York Genome Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The study’s findings could have a lot of implications in future research into treatments for chronic conditions related to aging that would not only add decades to patients' lifespan, but also their health span, which is the period of a person’s life spent in good health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“To me, that’s exciting,” Sanjana said. “This kind of data generation is so powerful for folks who want to do things like bioengineering and creating new kinds of therapies to restore healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For Blackwell, the study also shows that patients still have the chance to change their aging trajectory later in life – “but the window is short,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The best ways to add healthy years to your life are to maintain a healthy level of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol, don't smoke and drink "very little," Blackwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Research has shown diet, exercise, genetics and, sometimes, luck, impact longevity. However, the new study suggests people may still see benefits from changes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Starting at 45 to 50, you could gain as much as 10 years of healthy life and this study just shows the truth of that at a cellular level,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:02:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNbG9ScFJtTnpDdGxMRDdKYm9hbzRnSm9XWExSdFZON2lGV3k1ZndpQXR5b3NJMFNMaTR2VmdlampXYUl1M0VmcW0zUTNWYktUdHVCVFcza3F2X0drNjJuSHJaQ05jVFc2RGFENFNhTWZsLTAxLXhJemlaakx4RlRwYVRsQUliUnJGM0JRLXdFVmx1UzlHY3V5eEZENXFYdUF1eUJwNA</guid></item><item><title>随着越来越多的年轻人接受筛查，更多的结肠癌正在早期被发现。以下是降低风险的方法- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE82WGVtZGNVMnVWYTFKbFJJX19FVTcxUnBtRXM2dllPb1RiT0pjZXJCdXRyaHRDSEZQTEdKdlBCaThkUXBuV1FkWXB4aGdYSWpQQUg2RkNuemJoQWtCYjV5blhWczlodnBoWTItQms5b2luTTdRckxNMFh3SdIBgAFBVV95cUxOcWZDNTljZkk2V0g5TjRTNlBkSnYtNGZKVkdBeVJfeHBnT3hmNkg2X05XS1QwMVZJU0dfU1NfSnJvQ0FEVlp0YnZ0ZkR2VzhReWRGNFcwamo5RWFMcElXVWI0Z3pNYlhHdWItUVN0UFNCdmN4ckx3cGZlWFV3VEdGZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00043b6ne9fsr2j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even more colorectal cancer cases are being found in adults under 50, and a new collection of research suggests that a surge in screening may be tied to many of the more recent diagnoses – but not the overall trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00063b6n6t7e2t1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2018, the American Cancer Society &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/05/30/colon-cancer-screenings-guidelines-nr.cnn"&gt;updated its guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for colon and rectal cancer screening, recommending that adults at average risk get screened starting at age 45 – earlier than 50, which was previously advised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00073b6ntyytjup7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in 2021, the US Preventive Services Task force also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-45-wellness"&gt;lowered the recommended age&lt;/a&gt; to start screening for colon and rectal cancers from 50 to 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtfc6uz00053b6noqe3awtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The shift in screening guidelines is associated with a recent increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses, but it does not explain the rise among younger adults in general – a trend that began in the mid-1990s and includes late-stage cancers, as well. Colorectal cancer refers to colon cancer, which starts in the colon, and rectal cancer, which starts in the rectum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtfcjej00073b6nd1olz3fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The drivers of rising incidence are still unknown, but many research efforts are ongoing, with investigations covering the gamut from microplastics to ultra processed food and many other gut exposures introduced in the last half of the 20th century, when this began,” Elizabeth Schafer, associate scientist of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000h3b6nrtzrkpbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lowering the screening age “has likely facilitated earlier detection of cancers that might have been missed,” but there is still more work to do to identify the driving factors behind the ongoing overall rise of colorectal cancer in younger ages, Dr. Joseph Rinaldi, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000i3b6nj53oe450@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is likely that factors beyond screening guidelines are contributing to the overall rise in colorectal cancer incidence,” Rinaldi said. “Much work remains to identify causal factors – whether environmental, genetic, or population-based – that can be targeted for prevention and, potentially, reversal of this trend.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00083b6ng1lr2aid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, research&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conducted by the American Cancer Society that was published Monday in the medical journal JAMA found that the share of US adults ages 45 to 49 who are up to date on colorectal cancer screening climbed from 20.8% in 2019 and 19.7% in 2021 to 33.7% in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00093b6npy2v7io7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting for screening to take off in this age group,” Schafer, an author on the new screening study, said in the email. “But the real thrill is the translation to early diagnosis, which means less intense treatment and lives saved.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000c3b6nvxtjgpct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A second study, also conducted by the American Cancer Society and published Monday in JAMA, found that the prevalence of early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults 45 to 49 increased from 9.4 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 to 11.7 per 100,000 in 2021 and then to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000d3b6nnzf754uq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That translates to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.9147?guestAccessKey=cdcd25ed-4acb-4a31-a67f-2b993aace50c&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=080425" target="_blank"&gt;50% relative increase&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000e3b6nshgb6vvy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If screening was the cause of the rise, the increase would have been for early- instead of late-stage disease,” said Schafer, lead author of the second paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtffssm00093b6n016vhk93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Local stage diagnosis was rare in this age group before screening because there are usually no symptoms yet,” Schafer said of early-stage cancers that have not spread to other parts of the body. “So yes, it was a bit shocking, actually, to see early-stage incidence double from 9.4 to 17.5 per 100,000 in this newly screened group.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7s3b0001s26p888wvfpjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a rise in colon and rectal cancers persists among younger adults, public health experts now urge them to know the warning signs and to get screened when eligible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdt7u8c4001d3b6nfu9pprrl@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-signs-and-symptoms-to-watch-for" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The signs and symptoms to watch for
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000k3b6nohc0gb20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of the people who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 50 are not eligible for screening because they haven’t yet reached the recommended age of 45. And most people who are eligible have still not been screened, said Jessica Star, associate scientist of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author on the new screening study and an author on the other paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000l3b6nqxn41ka1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether someone is recommended for screening or not, they should still watch for signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer and talk with their doctor if they notice any, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000m3b6nidba93h9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women&lt;/a&gt; will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000n3b6n9na3pncx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common symptom is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rectal bleeding,” Star said in an email, adding that 41% of patients under 50 tend to experience this symptom, compared with 26% of patients older than 50. Many people also may have abdominal cramping or pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000o3b6ncn7vcmbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Young people, especially, are reluctant to talk about these types of symptoms, but it could actually save their life,” Star said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000p3b6n3h9gztse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Other important symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits or the shape of stool, decreased appetite, and weight loss. People with any of these symptoms that persist for several weeks should be followed up with a doctor’s visit,” she said. “If you are young and your concerns are not being addressed, get a second opinion. There are too many stories about young people being told they have hemorrhoids, finding out months or years later that it is cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000r3b6n6an3yntf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Kelly Spill, 33, experienced symptoms of colorectal cancer after the birth of her first child, she said, her doctors told her that they were tied to being postpartum and internal hemorrhoids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000s3b6nw71dd7cy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One day I went to the bathroom, and I looked down, and you would have thought it was my time of the month, and it most certainly was not. That’s when it became extremely alarming,” Spill &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/health/immunotherapy-cancer-patients-study-wellness"&gt;told CNN in May&lt;/a&gt; of the blood in her stool.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000t3b6naqc2y3ab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she noticed massive amounts of blood again, she took photos and showed them to a primary care physician. The doctor immediately ordered a colonoscopy, and that’s what led to her being diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer at age 28 in 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000u3b6nyvd7xp8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To self-advocate is such a big one,” Spill said. “If I didn’t push, push, push, I don’t know where I would be, and especially as a new mom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000v3b6ntix1ovb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spill was treated with an immunotherapy drug called dostarlimab and is now a healthy mother of three. She remains cancer-free.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000x3b6ncwtl48rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Getting screened can help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, because almost all colorectal cancers begin as precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. But through screening, these polyps can be identified and removed before they turn cancerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000y3b6nsyl7o0sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current options for colorectal cancer screening for people at average risk include a stool-based fecal test either annually or every three years; a traditional colonoscopy every 10 years; a virtual colonoscopy every five years; or a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which involves using a tube-like instrument called an endoscope to examine the lower part of the colon, every five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000z3b6nu4exsx1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate study published Monday in JAMA found that when people newly eligible for screening were automatically mailed a fecal test kit at their home address without asking for it, they were more likely to complete screening than those who were asked to actively choose between a colonoscopy, a fecal test or deferring screening altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00103b6nhoakra20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Another important question is how to get more people screened, especially people without access to healthcare, a group that had no significant increase in screening in our study,” Schafer, who was not involved in that study, said in the email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00113b6nirqv4f0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite recent increases in screening, it’s still estimated that more than 1 in 3 adults 45 and older are not getting screened as recommended, according to the &lt;a href="https://nccrt.org/our-impact/80-in-every-community/" target="_blank"&gt;National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are other steps people can take to help prevent colorectal cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00143b6ny5nj4t1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are many things people of all ages can do to reduce their risk, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and eating a healthy diet that is low in red and processed meat and high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables,” Star said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00153b6ntdn5f1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of all colorectal cancers in the US are attributable to those modifiable risk factors, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00163b6n6yc1vit8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been several studies that work to identify factors contributing to the development of colon cancer. Maintaining a physically active lifestyle and a healthy weight is important, as obesity has been linked to early-onset disease,” Rinaldi said. “I also encourage avoiding tobacco, refined grains, and sugary beverages and instead focus on consuming a fiber-rich diet that is more plant-based and that limits the consumption of red and processed meats, as this is thought to be protective to colon health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
