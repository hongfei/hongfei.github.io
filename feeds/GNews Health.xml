Doctors discovered bile duct cancer that had 'spread everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was more advanced than we could possibly imagine,' said Ms Ainsworth, a London-based lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though Jonathan was a doctor, he didn’t get checked immediately, he waited until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once you know that there’s something wrong, get yourself checked out as soon as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earliest signs that something was wrong began in 2019, when Mr Ainsworth — a keen runner who was 'always training' — started complaining of a pain in his stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He did little about it for several months, until he noticed he had begun to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-b7098980-0bbf-11f0-88c0-cb8b99931380"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jonathan Ainsworth, 59, was 'fit and healthy' and 'always running and training' before he was diagnosed with deadly bile duct cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he eventually spoke to a doctor, he was referred for a scan which revealed severe inflammation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting for the referral, the infectious disease specialist decided to take his own bloods, with the results showing something 'wasn't right'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went off to St Mary’s Hospital and they said that he had cancer,' said Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 2019, doctors revealed he had bile duct cancer, which affects around 3,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease impacts the tubes in the digestive system that carry bile; a fluid that helps the body digest food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 20 and 25 per cent of those diagnosed at the earliest stages will survive for more than five years, compared to between two and five per cent of those who are diagnosed later, when the cancer has spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the position of the bile ducts within the body, it easily migrates to other nearby organs, like the pancreas and the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bile duct cancer can be symptomless, particularly in its earliest stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when it does cause problems, signs include changes to your bowel habits, itchy skin, high temperature, abdominal pain and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite being a doctor, he left it 'too late' to seek medical help for his stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;His widow, Thelma Ainsworth, spent years struck with guilt about not pushing her husband to see a doctor sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Some also notice yellowing of the skin and the white of the eyes — known medically as jaundice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within three weeks of Mr Ainsworth's diagnosis he had 'gone', leaving her widowed with two young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon afterwards, she found that she started blaming herself, believing it was her fault for her husband's untimely death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since the diagnosis and for many months, maybe years afterwards, I blamed myself,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[I thought] that it was somehow my fault...because I didn’t get him to check himself out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, it 'all came to a head' while she was trying to write a children’s book — something she had wanted to do for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She discovered that her grief acted as a 'blockage' to her creative writing and decided to start journaling to help her process the difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These notes became the inspiration for her first memoir,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://mybook.to/IAmAWolfTonight"&gt; I Am A Wolf Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It was this blockage inside me that I felt I needed to release,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The book, which she described as 'raw, unflinching and honest', explores themes of cancer loss, complex grief, love, resilience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is 'no right or wrong way to do grief', according to Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she hopes her words will offer hope and encourage others to be patient and kind to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At some point you will reach a stage where you’re able to process that grief, but it will take years, and I’m not unusual in that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;' &lt;/span&gt;I hope that my book is helpful for anyone who’s been in that circumstance where they’ve had to go out of their way to reveal their inner animal in order to survive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:42:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxONFFFU2N3TGVQSUdpMHNjS1lySHRWdVduUUJpeFdUYWJrVFV3Mkp0clZMbFRTazA1Wkl0SHRoazJmZVJzcy11c2lvQnZtX0xIM1M4NzR3MFk2RWtQaDIzZVNxdEJvQVp2cXdqYzhoRWxIYm5ONGIxb0x6RVdrNHBzcUpHMFJCdUxDamUyNDRwODBXNzlVVFhfODV0dVZfRUdwTnMw0gGoAUFVX3lxTFB5Z3VKMWhuWFpxMWNZdWFWUC1VZ09EWjIzcklLMGVwLWZfdTlac0pIYzR2aXNSSzFlZVdlU3d0NWRrRzM1M09iUTFyMGJXcmJOOHJpRUg3U3lETy0yYkZGdGRtUTFmNVNPZ19wQnlJZUIxQ3lSZ05KQVhCWWxFcGdSN0tidWZJTjhmLVFGMDdKNVppTzE1bTFybGJ0MVotUXZsWGoxWTNxVw</guid></item><item><title>The Worst Habits for Your Back, According to Spine Surgeons - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPeFY2VUNaVWZ6X1NMMll1dHNtb3pUcjExTFdveDZwc0pTWUFVSHo5VzFlQ0RxNWpLQy01M1g0bWg4eUU0ZDRmSEdONzFhV05WX1JQMXBuc1FpQ0hNLVg4Xy1GYjFhYkFySEE5TlFOck1FaDNyUDRQb1N3SEZkcHp5Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As I write this, I’m wearing a large heating pad on my back like a cape. Why? Because when I parked my car at the grocery store, I made the mistake of twisting around to grab shopping bags from the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I felt a zing of pain in the middle of my back. Uh oh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db415-H.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that over a third of U.S. adults have experienced back pain during a three-month period — but few treatments actually work, according to a new &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/well/lower-back-pain-treatments-nsaids.html" title=""&gt;study that analyzed hundreds of trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So I thought it might be helpful to focus on how to prevent back pain in the first place. I’ve asked orthopedic doctors for their best tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7b752b55"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skip the “B.L.T.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;My car incident “is what we euphemistically call the B.L.T.,” or the bend, lift and twist, said Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins III, a neurosurgeon in New York City who specializes in spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doing all three actions at once, whether by shoveling snow or extracting a child from a car seat, “maximizes the stress on the disc, making it more likely to rupture,” Dr. Jenkins said. “As a spine surgeon, I would never do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you are about to B.L.T., take a beat and try to do each motion separately, Dr. Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When lifting an object, make sure both feet are planted and your weight is evenly distributed, said Dr. Gbolabo Sokunbi, a spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. Then lift from your legs instead of your arms and back, he said. Keep heavier items close to your body when picking them up, which puts &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="back.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74707-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;less strain&lt;/a&gt; on your spine, Dr. Sokunbi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Medical disinformation connected to the West Texas measles outbreak has created a new problem. Children are being treated for toxic levels of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock confirms it is treating children with severe cases of measles who are also suffering from vitamin A toxicity. According to the hospital, they have admitted fewer than 10 pediatric patients who were all initially hospitalized due to measles complications but have elevated levels of vitamin A that is resulting in abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the CDC to update its measles guidance to promote the use of vitamin A. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, recommended in an article published March 2 on FOX News to take vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate and severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a March 4 interview on Fox News, Kennedy suggested that therapies such as the use of cod liver oil — which contains vitamins A and D — were "working" in treating measles patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports from the West Texas area that cod liver oil is in high demand and a big seller at area pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hospital is informing the public to reduce consumption of vitamin A and has warned that excessive amounts of it may result in significant adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that taking vitamin A will prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has administered vitamin A in Africa to reduce mortality during measles outbreaks. This is a strategy in a part of the world with widespread malnourishment, and vitamin A deficiency compromises the immune system. However, malnourishment is not a problem in West Texas or in other locations where the measles outbreak has spread in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 320 people in Texas have contracted measles in recent weeks. Forty people have been hospitalized in the state, and one child has died in the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

They've both at one point or another caused  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; colonic-related controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.royal.uk/clarencehouse/speech/speech-hrh-prince-wales-complementary-therapies-and-cancer-care-royal-college-obstetricians"&gt;2004 speech&lt;/a&gt; to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on complementary therapies and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; care, the then Prince of Wales's comments on &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gerson-pdq"&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt; – a health programme, marketed as an alternative treatment for cancer, that includes regular coffee enemas as a way to clear toxins from the body – seemed to endorse the unproven regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prince's opinion drew criticism from &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/329/7457/118"&gt;medical experts&lt;/a&gt;. Wellness influencer Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/01/06/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-promotes-a-135-coffee-enema-kit/"&gt;promoted a DIY coffee enema&lt;/a&gt; kit on Goop, her lifestyle website – again &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-colonic-irrigation"&gt;drawing criticism&lt;/a&gt; from specialists who &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-doctors-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-1.4479955"&gt;urged Goop fans&lt;/a&gt; to "keep the coffee out of your rectum and in your cup".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the expert critique, coffee enemas continue to be a social media wellness trend offered in many alternative health clinics as a method to cleanse the colon and detoxify the body. More worryingly, coffee enemas are still recommended &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/apple-cider-vinegar-netflix"&gt;by some influencers&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;alternative treatment for cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pENvHuJd9MY?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why does the popularity of this controversial trend persist despite the bad press? Do the benefits of a coffee enema outweigh the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.bladderandbowel.org/medicinal-treatment/enema/"&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt; clears the bowel of faecal matter. Usually, the procedure involves inserting a nozzle attached to a pouch containing fluid into the rectum so the liquid can be squeezed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conventional medicine, enemas are used to clear the bowel before surgery, for severe cases of constipation or sometimes as part of a bowel management scheme – in people with inflammatory bowel diseases, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://colonic-association.org/colon-hydrotherapy/history"&gt;It's claimed&lt;/a&gt; by some coffee enema advocates that, before the advent of modern painkillers, Florence Nightingale used coffee enemas as a form of pain management in soldiers during the Crimean War, and doctors used them &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/module-28-charlotte-gerson/umc.cmc.vid7anfcpffn43gs2zg7eku0"&gt;in the second world war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156658" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg" alt="colon illustration" class="wp-image-156658 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-467x415.jpg 467w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-600x534.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Enemas have been used to clear the bowel for people with inflammatory bowel diseases. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library Getty)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the advances in medicine and technology since Nightingale was nursing injured soldiers, coffee enemas continue to be promoted as a health practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt; continues to be highly publicised as an alternative option to chemotherapy. Patients follow a strict organic vegetarian diet, which can include up to 13 glasses of fruit juice and up to five coffee enemas daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gerson Institute &lt;a href="https://gerson.org/faqs/"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the enemas can increase gut movement which helps to empty bowels. Coffee enemas are believed to help the body expel toxins from the liver and gut, which is thought to relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee contains compounds &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;kahweol and cafestol&lt;/a&gt;, thought to boost an enzyme which helps remove harmful substances from the body. These substances are turned into bile salts and expelled from the body. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30387-0/fulltext"&gt;caffeine in coffee is thought&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate the liver and widen the bile ducts to increase the flow of bile and help remove toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show there is no evidence to prove this regime works to cure cancer and it is not supported by any reputable cancer organisations. But it's possible the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect might help some patients feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; showed there were more reports about the side effects of coffee enemas than their efficacy. Some people, for instance, experienced &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acgcr/fulltext/2020/01000/proctocolitis_from_coffee_enema.8.aspx"&gt;proctocolitis&lt;/a&gt; – inflamed rectum and colon – and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20073005/"&gt;rectal burns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtFDVWQhEF0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Self-cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the amount of waste that is expelled from the gut, coffee enemas can remove potassium from the body. This can lead to electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, muscle weakness and nausea. In &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;severe cases&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause irregular heartbeats and lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any enemas regularly for a long time can cause the bowel muscle to weaken, which is linked to constipation and inflammation of the bowel. In some &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/enemas/#:%7E:text=Many%20proponents%20of%20using%20home,balance%20and%20cause%20digestive%20symptoms."&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, enemas may damage the balance of good bacteria in the gut, which can cause cramping, diarrhoea and bloating and increase the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There no need for DIY enemas of any kind: the gut is self-cleaning. Regular digestion and bowel movements means the body gets rid of waste naturally. A high-fibre diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and seeds should be enough for good digestive health and could even &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/wholegrains-fibre-and-cancer-risk#"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/health-and-lifestyle/fibre/how-to-increase-your-fibre-intake/"&gt;Current advice&lt;/a&gt; suggests we consume at least 30 g of fibre daily. Most adults, however, have an average of only 19 g of fibre daily. Drinking plenty of water &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/water-a-fluid-way-to-manage-constipation"&gt;is also crucial&lt;/a&gt; to gut health. &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2017.1383355"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that eating &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fermentation"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as kimchi, kefir and kombucha, can help the good bacteria in the gut and aid with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee is more likely to be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/all-the-reasons-a-cup-of-coffee-really-can-be-good-for-you-236852"&gt;beneficial for health&lt;/a&gt; than coffee enemas. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007311"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that moderate coffee intake is linked to lower risk of heart disease, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media can be a useful way to learn about health but it's important to check who is giving this information – do they have credentials to back up their claims? It's always best to check with your doctor or specialist before embarking on any alternative or complementary therapies.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252412/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

“It supports the creation of enzymes and hormones, boosts immune function, and helps transport nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I'm not alone: Whether or not they know it, much of women in the United States are suffering from a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-deficiency-signs" target="_blank"&gt;protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. “Inadequate protein intake can have widespread negative effects on the body, impacting multiple systems and functions,” says Barmmer, listing off a host of symptoms I'm simply not interested in, including feeling weak, reduced strength, brittle hair and nails, reduced ability to fight infection or illness, and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to asking “how much protein do I need?” the nutritionist also shares some simple rules: If you're a sedndary adult, aim for 1 gram for every kilogram you weigh; if you're an active adult, 1.6 to 2.2 grams per every kilogram you weigh; and if you're over the age of 65, 1.2 to 1.5 grams per every kilogram you weigh. So if you weigh 165 pounds, that translates to 72.5 kilograms, so you're aiming for 72.5 grams of protein a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phew, this is even more intimidating than I thought! In an attempt to step up my protein game, Barmmer compiled a list of foods for me to eat as much as possible—and I'm sharing it with you. 2025 is the year of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating fish, not all have the same amount of protein. There are more than &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/102331/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;36 varieties that the FDA declares as healthy options&lt;/a&gt;, and the four that are the highest when it comes to protein are tuna (24.4g of protein in a 100 g serving for ahi tuna), salmon (25.92g in a 100g serving), cod (19.36 g of protein in a 100 g serving), and mackerel (25.45 g of protein in a 100 g serving).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hemp Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds may be tiny, but they are surprisingly mighty. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Two tablespoons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank"&gt;hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt; have just as much protein as two egg whites—along with all nine essential amino acids (a rarity), omega-3, and omega-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs should absolutely be part of your weekly rotation, but you want to eat the egg with the yolk,” says Barmmer. In a large egg, you'll get about six grams of available protein. “Eggs also have a good dose of brain and liver and gall bladder supporting choline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While they can and should be part of your rotation, don’t expect things like peanut butter to be a significant protein source in your diet,” levels Barmmer. "They will give a small boost but it simply requires too much in terms of volume and calories to reach your protein needs with them. For example, it would take 679 calories worth of peanut butter (7 tablespoons) to equal 175 calories of a 3-ounce serving of lean beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're gluten-free, plant-based, or on a whole foods diet, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-benefits-of-quinoa" target="_blank"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt; should be a big part of your diet. “This grain-like seed is one of the few complete plant protein sources providing about 8 grams per cup,” says Barmmer. “It’s rich in magnesium and fiber as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Greek Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thicker and creamier than regular yogurt because it's fermented for longer, Greek yogurt's health benefits far surpass the OG variety. “From a nutrition perspective, Greek yogurt typically has significantly more protein—often two times as much!—and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt,” says clinical nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Hodson&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, CDCES at NYU Langone Health. It's also a fantastic source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/calcium-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;calcium,&lt;/a&gt; which helps maintain strong bones and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big on social media recently, cottage cheese is having a come back. “Just half of a cup of cottage cheese can provide between 12 and 16 grams of protein,” says Barmmer. All you need to do is read the label. “It contains casein, a slow-digesting protein that supports muscle repair and growth. It’s filling and rich in calcium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Powders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein powders or collagen peptides are a great addition to you diet if you're looking to up your intake. “Collagen peptides are a convenient, bioavailable, and effective way to support your body's collagen needs, particularly as production naturally declines with age,” says Barmmer. “Adding them to your diet can help maintain youthful skin, strong joints, and overall connective tissue health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The debate on the sustainability of beef is nuanced and requires a separate discussion, but if you can put that aside and purely look at nutrition quality, it’s really difficult to beat beef,” Barmmer says. “This is one of the most nutrient-dense sources of protein available and is a great idea to include in weekly meal plans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:52:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE0xVi1xbVhRRmphV0tER0lpejBOU1BiVXpHaldlXzVpUEZJa3ZUMlRDUXJ2UHJ0QlI5bEpBM1FuaEVFam1RNFJkb1dhRjRoRDVyRlYzdFB1MEJwbHRK</guid></item><item><title>Measles - United States of America - World Health Organization</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBqbDh4S01TaHA3cmZXR2QtU0o0NUQ3M2pnb0l6a0taYk1FRlhSLXNEVlFEQ2lnSzZwNWRHUG9JXzhxOGNJZEFLVVRHMEJiampGaWZMVXRSS3gxTnc3azRpTnFjNnFIeWhSV0Z4ZGs1cVlESHd4MExqRldB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="sf-detail-body-wrapper don-revamp"&gt;
        

                

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 11 March 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) received a report from the International Health Regulation (2005) (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of the United States of America (United States) on the ongoing measles outbreak in the country, notified under IHR because it is an unusual event with potential significant public health impact, with the number of cases and deaths in 2025 exceeding the numbers in previous years. Additionally, cases linked to the outbreak in the State of Texas, United States, have been reported in Mexico.
Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death.
From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 17 States have reported a total of 378 cases of measles, including two deaths - the first deaths related to measles in the United States in a decade. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and the overall hospitalization rate is 17%. In 2025, within the larger public health event, there are three distinct measles outbreaks reported, accounting for 90% (341/378) of reported cases. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (US CDC) and other government agencies are working to control the outbreaks. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, since then imported cases of measles have been detected in the country, as the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles.
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Description of the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 11 March 2025, the NFP of the United States notified to WHO an ongoing outbreak of measles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 378 cases have been reported from 17 States including: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Two deaths have also been reported, one confirmed in Texas and one under investigation in New Mexico. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. The hospitalization rate is 17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of the 378 cases (341 cases) have been associated with three distinct outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025, while the remainder are sporadic cases that are part of the larger outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From late January until 14 March 2025, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 259 cases in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. Of these, 34 patients have been hospitalized, and 257 (99%) were unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status. In February 2025, an unvaccinated school-aged child who lived in the Texas outbreak area died of measles. This was the first death in the United States related to measles in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 14 March, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 35 cases of measles. Of the 35 cases, 28 were unvaccinated, two were vaccinated, and five had unknown vaccination status&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2025 to 20 March 2025, the US CDC reported 128 measles DNA sequences. Texas submitted 92 identical DNA sequences in genotype D8; while 10 DNA sequences from New Mexico and one DNA sequence from Kansas were identical to those from Texas. Texas also reported three genotype D8 sequences (a total of 19 D8 sequences have been reported from the affected States) with single nucleotide substitutions. Additionally, a total of five distinct genotype B3 sequences were reported from the States of Alaska, California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of this outbreak is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence of decreased vaccine effectiveness or changes in the virus that would result in increased severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, measles was declared eliminated&lt;sup&gt;[1] &lt;/sup&gt;in the United States and, since then, imported cases of measles have been detected in the country since the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  The United States last verified the ongoing elimination of measles in 2024. In 2023, the vaccination coverage rate for two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among children in kindergarten in the United States was 92.7%.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease which affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash usually appears 10-14 days after exposure and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious from four days before up to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur in about one in every 1000 reported cases. About two or three deaths may occur for every 1000 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization against measles prevents measles and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal, State, local health authorities and community partners in the United States are implementing the following public health measures to control the outbreak: US CDC escalated to a level 3 Incident Management Structure on 3 March 2025 to provide remote technical assistance on diagnostics, post-exposure prophylaxis, healthcare infection and prevention, case investigation and confirmation, and communication support. The Texas Department of State Health Services is leading the investigation in Texas. US CDC deployed subject matter experts to assist the response. WHO has issued epidemiological alerts and updates due to the increase in measles cases in several countries in the WHO Region of the Americas that started in 2024. WHO continues to monitor the situation and work closely with countries in the Region of the Americas to support their vaccination, surveillance and rapid outbreak response efforts to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles and to protect the health of the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The transmission mode is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. A rash develops several days later, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment approved for measles; most people recover within 2-3 weeks. Measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia, which are more common in children under 5 years and adults more than 20 years of age. Measles can be prevented by immunization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first WHO Region to be declared free of the endemic transmission of measles by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas. Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public health risk in the Region of the Americas for measles is considered high due to the persistence of the circulation of the virus from imported cases, which have resulted in a limited number of outbreaks, with several generations of cases and the appearance of cases associated with pre-existing outbreaks in new geographical areas. Additionally, an increase in the susceptible population due to persistently low vaccination coverage related to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, increased vaccine hesitancy in some communities and sectors of the population, and limited access to health services, particularly for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up-to-date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas within the United States should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all settings, consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis, including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR) and/or MMR vaccine, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure, including when planning to travel to the United States. Unvaccinated individuals from areas in the United States experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even dietary staples that don’t taste outright salty, such as &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/salt_in_bread/#:~:text=Many%20industrial%20loaf%20manufacturers%2C%20'craft,loaves%20and%20other%20baked%20goods." target="_blank"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, can be a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://aces.illinois.edu/news/reducing-salt-bread-without-sacrificing-taste" target="_blank"&gt;major source of dietary sodium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Given the glut of salt in grocery items, and that &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" target="_blank"&gt;48 percent of American adults&lt;/a&gt; experience hypertension, there’s a good chance that people stand to benefit from curbing salt intake, even marginally.

When it comes to the recommended 2.3-gram sodium limit, “I don't think it's too stringent in this country,” she adds. Eating at home is the easiest way to control how much salt goes in our food. To that end, “grocery shopping is the most important part of the process,” Gheewala says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:59:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPVEhSOEtXT0JwYVBjNElZa19FN1UzQkxHWjluaGd1X2h3QWhzcnNtOEJOMFZXelVtaDhiSFJXWXpmUTl5RHFKYlNLZVEzZXdHbzN0elVUc3Fqc3ZXTTBvZ0NaUGpxcThDa3VUSjh2Uk9GblJDMG9HLUphOEtjT3dIYk8yY3M5SlE</guid></item><item><title>My Daughter-in-Law Demands That I Babysit Her Toddlers for Days on End.

Our grandchildren are all grown, and one is expecting what will be our first great grandchild. Our son seemed to be a lifelong bachelor until he met and married “Stacy.” They currently have a 4-year-old and a toddler—and much as we adore them, it is very hard to be around them without help. We just don’t have the energy, mobility, and money to spare to spoil our grandchildren like we did their cousins back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsk4v00253572dngcx84h@published"&gt;The problem is, this greatly upsets Stacy. Our daughter-in-law will make backhanded comments about how our other grandchildren were obviously our favorites because we did things like watch them all summer or take trips to Disneyland. These days, it is very hard for either of us to bend down and pick up fallen items. When we go shopping, we need to use scooters because just crossing the grocery store is an ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsk8z00273572evkrjein@published"&gt;This situation hurts us because our son keeps echoing his wife. We ended up having a huge fight because Stacy wanted to go to some convention and our son didn’t feel comfortable watching both children for a three-day weekend without help. My husband and I told him that wouldn’t be possible for us to come over and help. Firstly, their guest room is on the second floor and the stairs are steep. Plus, the guest bathroom is downstairs. We have to get up several times a night to use the bathroom. Our conversation got heated and then Stacy accused us out of the blue of trying to sabotage her career. Stacy has been trying to start her own business since she married our son and every attempt went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand it was hurtful, but I didn’t think it was enough for my son and his wife to completely cut us off. But they will not answer the phone and refuse to even send pictures of their children. We are heartbroken and our other children are furious at their brother. We don’t want our family to split apart over pettiness like this. We already sent Stacy a card and flowers for her birthday and apologized. No response. What else can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

More and more Americans these days seem to have &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;the mistaken idea&lt;/a&gt; that any problem with your body is in your mind, surmountable if you really wish it to be, and perhaps that’s Stacy’s issue. But she had kids with a guy who had older parents. She’s &lt;a href="https://hmmdaily.com/2018/10/18/your-real-biological-clock-is-youre-going-to-die/"&gt;running up against biology&lt;/a&gt;, and in denial about what that actually means. Maybe she’s under a lot of pressure to show that she can succeed in her business, maybe she’s annoyed that her husband is apparently only minimally useful in the arena of childcare, or maybe she’s just plain unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskn0002d3572dz6seqy5@published"&gt;I can’t figure out from afar what is wrong with this lady. But she’s married to your son—who, by the way, is the one who “doesn’t feel comfortable” watching the kids for three days without help. He could do any number of other things to fix this problem, besides expecting you to visit. My number one suggestion would be that he should simply buck up! But he could also hire paid outside help to come cover him for periods of time during the weekend, so he has rest breaks; or make plans to order in meals so he doesn’t have to cook; or band together with local parent friends to make plans to meet at a playground during the days, so he has some adult contact and a pressure valve for that much togetherness. Some combination of these strategies would be what a mother in this situation would do. Why can’t he?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskpy002e3572zotlyku5@published"&gt;It also bothers me that your son doesn’t seem to register, or care, how big the disconnect between your reality and Stacy’s understanding of your life has become. The fight between Stacy and your husband is a red herring in this story, though it was likely hurtful of your husband to say what he said. It’s your son who’s the issue. I’m glad that your other kids seem to be more understanding of your situation. Perhaps they, who hopefully are not also blocked from his phone, could help explain it to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsl1b002h3572cgtfcf5z@published"&gt;My brother’s ex-wife lives a few blocks from me. Their divorce was fairly civilized and I adore my nephews and nieces, so I often help out by dropping the kids off at school, babysitting, or helping her fix things around the house. Over Christmas, my brother unloaded on me, accusing me of disloyalty and “sniffing around” his ex, before demanding that I keep away from her and his kids. It was a very ugly scene, which really upset my parents, and I’m still chewing over it but I am also wondering whether I need to give in to his unreasonable and selfish demands. I don’t want to further inflame whatever is going on with him and his ex, or drag the kids into further drama, but I equally don’t want to just ghost my niblings or my sister-in-law. Do I just discuss it with her? I’d talk to my brother but, as you may have guessed, he’s not particularly reasonable or mature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslcs002k3572ml2vrpt6@published"&gt;Clearly there are things going on beneath the surface here with this divorce that are not “civilized”—not exactly. I would at the very least update your perception of this particular situation, from “they seem mostly fine” to “volatile; beware.” Your brother seems quite triggered by the idea that you’re doing the things he used to do—I bet he’s probably way more upset by “helping her fix things around the house” than by anything else on this list of acts of service. (Would he be this mad if you just did some school runs, barely speaking to her at all? I doubt it!) This is a fevered mindset he may come out of with time, but not one that will respond well to rationality, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslen002l3572vvkbwy5v@published"&gt;Sadly, I do think you might need to wait a minute to go back to being “there” for them—or, find some ways to do this that don’t directly involve being around her, or being in her house. (Maybe the kids could come to your parents’ house without her, and you could see them there, for example.) I don’t think you should totally ghost her, though I bet if you did, she would be able to guess why you did it. You could let her know why you’re pulling back, and stipulate that you didn’t mind doing any of those jobs for her—and hope to be able to do so again in the future. This doesn’t have to be forever. But they are the ones who have to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

My two younger sisters did not get along with her husband’s daughter, “Julie.” I thought it was basic teenage drama until recently. Julie and my younger sister are both engaged. I have a different dad than my sisters and make a pretty good living working for him. I offered to give my sister around $10,000 for the wedding, since she and her partner are teachers and as poor as church mice.&lt;/p&gt;

Julie and I don’t have a relationship. I saw her a few times while she was still living at home, but we don’t even exchange Christmas cards. But she thinks I should pay for her wedding? I would basically tell Julie to get bent, but my mom isn’t in good health and doesn’t need this stress in her life. Her husband seems to have no spine when it comes to Julie. Both my sisters have stated they hate Julie and think she is a brat, but again are worried about our mom. My mom wants me to make a “better effort” here, but will not say what that is, besides just paying up the cash.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, you don’t need to give Julie money, let alone ten thousand big ones, out of some family connection that’s more legal and technical than it is emotional or even biological. You could toss her a Christmas card, sure, and certainly you should be civil and friendly when you’re in proximity to one another, for the sake of your relatives, but I think that’s the extent of your obligation to this person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Washington crunched the numbers from a public health database, looking at records covering the dietary habits of 162,602 women, 124 of whom developed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"&gt;oral cancer&lt;/a&gt; over a 30-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with women who drank less than one sugary drink per month, those who indulged in one or more sugary drinks daily were 4.87 times more likely to develop oral cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who didn't drink alcohol or smoke much or at all, but consumed one or more sugary drinks daily, were at 5.46 times higher risk of oral cancer than women who drank less than one sugary drink each month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The incidence of oral cavity cancer (OCC) is increasing among non-smokers and young individuals without traditional risk factors worldwide," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this study, high sugar-sweetened beverage intake was associated with a significantly increased risk of OCC in women, regardless of smoking or drinking habits, yet with low baseline risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of this study means it does not show direct cause and effect, because other factors may be involved that the researchers haven't accounted for. However, the association is strong enough to suggest there is some relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, oral cancer &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html"&gt;is linked to&lt;/a&gt; risk factors such as smoking or chewing tobacco, drinking heavily, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It's a real concern that oral cancer cases are quickly rising outside of these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155911" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155911" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking.jpg" alt="Man smoking" class="wp-image-155911 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ManSmoking-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155911" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oral cancer has traditionally been linked to risk factors such as smoking. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-smoking-a-cigarette-in-the-dark-wQv94mB3TcY"&gt;Reza Mehrad/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason that's been put forward for this is our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/western-diet-identified-as-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-scientists-warn"&gt;changing dietary habits&lt;/a&gt;. The unhealthy foods many of us are now consuming on a regular basis could be triggering long-term inflammatory responses from the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A Western dietary pattern has increasingly been recognized as a risk factor for gastrointestinal tract cancers and is characterized by high consumption of saturated fats, processed foods, and added sugars," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hypothesis is that diets with higher added sugar may contribute to chronic inflammation, which may, in turn, contribute to the risk of OCC."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations here – the study only looked at data for women, and covers a relatively low number of cancer cases – and the researchers are keen for more data to be collected and assessed on this potential link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's another compelling reason for us to watch what we drink as well as what we eat. The health dangers associated with sugary drinks aren't new, but we're now realizing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-quantified-the-harm-of-sugary-drinks-and-its-devastating"&gt;just how harmful&lt;/a&gt; they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The methodology and quality of the study are excellent and the data has been analysed in great detail," &lt;a href="https://sciencemediacentre.es/en/study-shows-women-high-consumption-sugary-drinks-was-associated-increased-risk-oral-cavity-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Raúl Zamora Ros, from the Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) in Spain, who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More studies are needed to confirm these associations and also to assess whether soft drinks with artificial sweeteners would be just as harmful, as many people substitute one for the other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2831121"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Otolaryngology – Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                  Only a handful of rabies cases tied to organ transplantation have ever been reported in the U.S.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A normally life-saving procedure has ended in a incredibly rare kind of death. According to local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a person recently died from a rabies infection contracted from the kidney of a deceased donor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WTOL, a media outlet based in Toledo, Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.wtol.com/article/news/local/michigan-resident-who-received-kidney-transplant-in-lucas-county-died-of-rabies-from-infected-organ-first-mich-death-since-2009/512-b9e08ef7-9c12-4014-bce5-81c0d1f5d6fa"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the unusual death Wednesday, which was confirmed by health officials in Michigan and Ohio, as well as the CDC. Officials say that no one else is at risk of rabies from the tainted procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The cause of death is rabies and complications,” Carl Schmidt, a deputy coroner with the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, told WTOL. “The diagnosis was confirmed by sending tissue to the CDC.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies"&gt;Rabies&lt;/a&gt; is a virus that can infect the brain and spinal cord of most any mammal. It’s infamous for being a practical death sentence once the infected starts to show signs of illness, such as aggression, disorientation, and a strong fear of water. Symptoms can take weeks to appear in humans, however, and death can almost always be prevented if someone gets timely treatment before this happens. Post-exposure prophylaxis is a combination of the rabies vaccine and donated antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The virus typically spreads through the saliva of infected animals, often from scratches or bites. Widespread vaccination programs in pets and improved animal control have made rabies a rare occurrence in much of the world, with fewer than 10 deaths reported annually in the U.S. But Americans do still sometimes catch rabies, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/california-teacher-dies-from-rare-rabies-infection-after-bat-encounter-in-classroom-2000532968"&gt;usually from bats&lt;/a&gt; or other infected wildlife. Even rarer is a fatal case of rabies transmitted via transplantation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last such widely reported death in the U.S. appears to have &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2013/s0315_rabies_organs.html"&gt;occurred in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, involving a Maryland resident (other people who received organs from the deceased donor were given post-exposure prophylaxis). In 2004, a cluster of four deaths in Texas was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043018"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to a single decreased donor. Transplantation-related rabies is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6000923/"&gt;bigger problem&lt;/a&gt; in China, where rabies is more commonly reported in general, but still very rare.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Donors and their organs are routinely tested for potentially serious infections or other diseases that could be transmitted to a recipient. But in its investigation of the 2013 case, the CDC noted that donors typically &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2013/s0315_rabies_organs.html#:~:text=If%20rabies%20is%20not%20clinically%20suspected%2C%20laboratory%20testing%20for%20rabies%20is%20not%20routinely%20performed%2C%20as%20it%20is%20difficult%20for%20doctors%20to%20confirm%20results%20in%20the%20short%20window%20of%20time%20they%20have%20to%20keep%20the%20organs%20viable%20for%20the%20recipient."&gt;aren’t tested&lt;/a&gt; for rabies if they’re not suspected to have it. In the earlier U.S. cases, neither deceased donor was initially believed to have been killed by rabies (in retrospect, they probably were).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recipient in this latest case received their transplant in late December 2024, and died from their infection in January 2025. Though the person underwent their operation in Ohio, they lived in Michigan, making this the first human case of rabies documented in the latter state since 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials have conducted an investigation into the matter and determined there’s no further risk of rabies from the exposure. The University of Toledo Medical Center, where the procedure was performed, has also said that no glaring issues with how the transplant was carried out were identified.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The health system has worked closely with public health authorities and has conducted a thorough review of this case, which found all best practices and standard safety protocols were appropriately followed,” the Center said in a statement provided to WTOL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, this appears to be an extremely rare, but nonetheless tragic freak occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                                        Canada's most populous province is fighting a measles outbreak even bigger than the one in Texas and New Mexico. Public Health Ontario said Thursday that more than 100 new cases were reported in the last week, bringing the total of confirmed and probable cases reported since October to 572, reports &lt;a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/2025/03/27/ontario-measles-case-count-hits-572-up-by-more-than-100-in-past-week/"&gt;CP24&lt;/a&gt;. The sharp rise is "due to continued exposures and transmission among individuals who have not been immunized," the health agency said. Dozens more cases have been reported in other provinces, making the outbreak the country's largest since 2011. No deaths have been reported but authorities in Ontario say 42 measles patients, most of them unvaccinated children, have been hospitalized, including two in intensive care.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        As in the Texas and New Mexico outbreak, many measles patients in Canada are from Mennonite communities. "Cases could spread in any unvaccinated community or population but are disproportionately affecting some Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities due to a combination of under-immunization and exposure to measles in certain areas," Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief health officer, wrote to provincial health units earlier this month, per &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11095201/measles-outbreak-ontario-mennonite-communities-new-brunswick/"&gt;Global News&lt;/a&gt;. He said the Ontario outbreak had been traced "back to an exposure at a large gathering with guests from Mennonite communities in New Brunswick last fall."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Marlene Epp, who directed the Mennonite studies program at the University of Waterloo, tells the &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-on-the-ground-in-the-epicentre-of-ontarios-measles-outbreak/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the church doesn't ban vaccination, but the community has a long history of rejecting what it considers to be government meddling, and vaccine mandates during the pandemic increased skepticism about vaccines in general. "There's a whole set of protocols that emerged in COVID that were highly problematic for conservative Mennonite communities," Epp says, especially the closing of churches, schools, and church-related social gatherings.

The Health Department learned Wednesday evening that the individual had tested positive for measles. The symptoms this individual experienced were relatively mild. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited Starbucks at 2896 S.

Much as she has many times across continents, she indulged in street food - a banh mi sandwich. A few days later she ate a grilled lobster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rhian said: ‘I started having stomach pains, which I never have… It kept me up all night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The context is, I’ve never had a bad stomach in my life. Even when I have food poisoning, it goes so quickly.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She endured &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13074473/Ulcerative-colitis-revealed-Louise-Thompson.html"&gt;a range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; for about four months – severe fatigue, blood in her stool, recurring fevers, and constant bloating. It wasn’t until the new year that she decided she could no longer avoid the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the doctor, where testing revealed she had developed ulcerative colitis (UC) in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine and rectum. UC, an &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13500969/Major-cause-inflammatory-bowel-disease-symptoms-treat-it.html"&gt;autoimmune condition&lt;/a&gt;, occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the colon, leading to ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are still unclear about what exactly causes UC, but they are confident that it results from the body’s attack on itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Rhian does not regret her trip or what she ate, telling her thousands of &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellaaa_rhian"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers: ‘I was traveling 10 years prior to that, I’ve been to multiple countries, I’ve eaten street food… I don’t regret anything. It hasn’t put me off traveling.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rhian has been in remission from UC for six months, meaning the inflammation in her colon is under control, her stomach pains have gone away, and she no longer has blood in her stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellaaa_rhian/video/7483833849382833430"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a TikTok: ‘With the help of medicine and also good diet and looking after myself, I feel so much better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep her UC manageable, Ms Rhian fills her diet with anti-inflammatory foods, including leafy greens, ginger and turmeric juice, green tea and black tea, bone broth, and ginger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also avoids gluten, which triggers an immune response that causes inflammation in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before traveling to Vietnam, she didn’t have to think about her diet at such a granular level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she has traveled to dozens of countries and, while she has had food poisoning linked to street food, nothing like this had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she noted she has a predisposition to autoimmune conditions and believes the food poisoning awakened UC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food poisoning does not cause UC, but it can be an activating trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections caused by bacteria such as salmonella and E. Coli can damage the lining of the intestines, allowing that bacteria to invade the gut wall, thus exposing the immune system to a barrage of harmful bacteria that spurs the immune system into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food poisoning can also throw the gut microbiome - balance of healthy bacteria in the body - out of balance. The gut is naturally populated with beneficial bacteria, but when invaded by the types that cause harm, the protective bacteria die out while the harmful ones replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are still unclear about what exactly causes UC, but they are confident it results from the body’s attack on itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics also come into play. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation estimates that up to 30 percent of people with a close family member will develop the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Ms Rhian does not have a history of UC in her family, she can still carry the genes that trigger it. Irritable bowel diseases such as UC involve hundreds of gene variants, each contributing to some risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Irritable bowel diseases are common in the US, with one estimate showing an estimated one in 100 has one. UC specifically affects more than 1.2 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her family members may also have genes that increase the risk of developing the condition but they've never been activated by outside triggers, such as food poisoning, taking antibiotics, eating too little fiber and too many processed foods, and an imbalance of gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Members of her family have been stricken with colorectal cancer in middle age, however, ‘so it was really key for me to get the message out that blood in your stool is not normal and to see a doctor,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/millennial-food-triggered-disease-no-cure-2047675"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She chalks the ordeal up to bad luck, telling her thousands of followers that, given her globe-trotting, adventurous appetite, and genetic makeup, ‘it was going to happen at some point in my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Don’t avoid traveling,’ she said. ‘It didn’t put me off anything. I went to Costa Rica in December. It obviously makes it a little more tricky with my symptoms… but I’m ok.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:47:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQMmhLQWJMcHhYNmZma2dvWmswdlRqNk5kNW5IT0ZOQWFwSVdYeGpzd2ZpM0p1T3p3U0dPVkRQVmFwUnNXZW9NSTBkVXloQnN3WTN3bEJ4WW9VRFpPNUlMZ2dYQ3V6RlZoSFFLMjc4UUNaMHpxVTBRNHVHbjVZTGlBOTA4d3NqNHpRdEtnT0U0dVhlcUZRRzVyN3BZOHFyVS1EcHdYWFMwb9IBrAFBVV95cUxPX21TaHQ2N0kxNnU0MEVTQURuaXJMaG8wTXNqYWY3WDJuc05OUy1salEwWXBuc3ZUcnNKc0N4ZmtBN0tIUkNNQ2NSSHU1cEFtQ0pzRmhlbDhVY3NIWnNaX3kxcTRhR0l1U25YWnczQ2dpQldlZEtiVndUa0dzdTRKckJ6UDdQc3Q0dTlRdGhDdE9jdWlzSVNuSThJMmJJempVQ1FqdWZPVjVQOVNO</guid></item><item><title>Cyanide plays a major role in the human body, study reveals - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5lbXZWYTVJTzVUSWg4RDk4TjNkcHNSTzgtUEtUV0VMM3RCdTZpZjY0Vk5mR0tHOVppQkV3cnRiZmtQMU5kQmxRTXozZHNqTXM5VzFJVVlJOUFNVUZaM1BwSTZKXzFZRGstbmZUdGluMnJFeUpzQTNydFZLTm1aTFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyanide is a highly lethal chemical that has been used in warfare and poisonings for centuries—that was the general consensus on the naturally occurring chemical up until spring 2025. But in a global study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01225-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, a research team from seven countries and 12 universities, including South Dakota State University, has upended the world's consensus on cyanide. The researchers have found that while cyanide remains highly poisonous, it also plays a fundamental role in normal cell function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Brian Logue, professor and head of SDSU's Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physics, is one of the country's leading experts on cyanide. Logue and Moustafa Khalaf, an SDSU research scientist, played a critical role in the research process by confirming and quantifying cyanide production in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The identification of endogenous cyanide production in mammals represents a significant advancement in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+biology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell biology&lt;/a&gt; and metabolism," Logue said. "This research highlights the dual nature of cyanide, acting as both a toxin at high concentrations and a crucial signaling molecule at low concentrations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A naturally produced poison?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, scientists had only known cyanide to be naturally produced in certain types of bacteria and plants. The process of producing cyanide in minute quantities had never been demonstrated in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through experiments on mice and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt;, the research team, led by scientists from Switzerland, observed that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hydrogen+cyanide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hydrogen cyanide&lt;/a&gt; was consistently present in the cells and organisms. This was supported by the detection of cyanide in the liver of mice and humans as well as in the bloodstream. The chemical, they found, was produced naturally, suggesting a role in fundamental physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Khalaf, cyanide's natural production in the body is linked to glycine, an amino acid, which stimulates its production in the liver cells. The research team was able to determine this interaction by adding glycine to cell cultures. By adding glycine, the production of hydrogen cyanide increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, cyanide is highly lethal and is toxic at certain doses. How does the human body regulate internal cyanide levels to prevent toxicity?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzyme, rhodanese, plays a critical role in toxicity prevention. It converts hydrogen cyanide into thiocyanates, nontoxic salts, which are eliminated from the body, Khalaf explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Echoing the principle of Paracelsus, the research indicates that the dose determines whether cyanide acts as a poison or has beneficial effects," Khalaf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logue and Khalaf confirmed and quantified the cyanide production in the cells by using their novel technique and patented technology, the Cyanalyzer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Potential therapeutic benefits and applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery has far-reaching potential therapeutic benefits and applications, many of which are in the medical field. Experiments conducted during this study showed low concentrations of hydrogen cyanide enhance cell survival during oxygen deprivation. This suggests cyanide plays a role in the body's protective mechanisms against conditions like stroke, Khalaf noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The discovery of cyanide's protective effects during hypoxia presents potential therapeutic strategies for stroke by enhancing brain cell resilience to oxygen shortage," Khalaf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings show that certain diseases—nonketotic hyperglycinemia being one—cause the body to produce excessive amounts of hydrogen cyanide. The rare disease causes glycine to build up in tissues and organs. It is most damaging to babies as excessive glycine can build up in the brain, leading to neurological disorders. Previously, there was almost no treatment for this disease, but this research, with fresh insight into glycine and rhodanese, may lead to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead author in the study, Csaba Szabo, believes these findings will "fundamentally change the way we think about cell biology and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on further understanding the precise roles of endogenous cyanide in health and disease, exploring its therapeutic potential while carefully managing its toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee makes the world go round. For millions of people out there, there’s no morning without coffee. But not all cups are created equal. There’s the espresso, the French press, the bottomless pot, and a bunch of other types of coffee. According to a new study, some of those are worse for your health than others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that coffee brewed in common workplace machines — especially those using metal filters — contains significantly higher levels of the cholesterol-raising compounds cafestol and kahweol than paper-filtered coffee. In other words, if you care about cholesterol, filtered coffee may just be the healthiest option out there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It’s not the bean, it’s how you make it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a complex beverage. It’s packed with biologically active compounds. Some are protective — like antioxidants. Others are energizing — like caffeine. But two molecules in particular, cafestol and kahweol, carry a darker side. These oily substances can raise LDL cholesterol, the kind that builds up in arteries and contributes to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the catch: cafestol and kahweol aren’t removed by roasting, grinding, or bean selection. They’re in all coffee. But whether they end up in your cup depends entirely on the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We studied fourteen coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers. From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee. Obviously, not all coffee machines manage to filter them out. But the problem varies between different types of coffee machines, and the concentrations also showed large variations over time,” says David Iggman, researcher at Uppsala University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper filters — like those used in drip &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/reviews/buying-guide/best-smart-coffee-machines/"&gt;coffee makers&lt;/a&gt; — trap most of these compounds. But brewing methods without a fine filter let them slip through. That includes French press, espresso, boiled coffee, and many workplace machines. Simply put, any type of coffee that doesn’t include a filter is likely adding cholesterol to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-filtered-coffee-is-a-quiet-hero"&gt;Filtered coffee is a quiet hero&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Filtered coffee is usually not the most popular choice. Even people who do drink filtered coffee don’t usually think about filters beyond whether they’re biodegradable or fit their machine. But these filters act like tiny health guardians. They trap &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; (a class of compounds that includes cafestol and kahweol) before they can enter your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even makeshift filters — like a double-layered polyester sock — proved effective in the lab. It’s not the sophistication of the machine that matters. It’s the presence of a fine enough barrier. The type of bean also didn’t seem to matter much. The difference is how you make your coffee, not what the coffee is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one reason why the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations now specifically endorse filtered coffee over unfiltered. Nordic countries love their coffee and opting for filtered was considered a &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1965" href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/your-gas-stove-is-more-dangerous-than-you-think-heres-why/"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; move, not a flavor crusade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coffees from brewing machines — common in hospitals and offices — contained up to 444 mg/L of cafestol. In contrast, paper-filtered coffee came in at just 12 mg/L. That’s more than a 35-fold difference. Espresso was even worse in some cases, with one sample topping 2,400 mg/L. Some espresso samples in the study had moderate diterpene levels. Others were off the charts. The variation likely comes down to differences in pressure, temperature, grind size, and machine cleanliness. But because espresso doesn’t use a paper filter, the risks remain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What this all means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran simulations based on average coffee consumption — about three cups per workday. Over time, switching from high-diterpene machine coffee to filtered drip coffee could reduce LDL cholesterol by 0.58 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might sound minor. But over the course of 5 years, this translates to a 13% reduction in heart disease risk, thanks to less plaque buildup in arteries​; over 40 years, it’s a 36% reduction, the researchers note. In public health terms, that’s a massive gain from a modest change. It’s like adding full-fat cream to each cup of filtered coffee. You might not taste it, but your heart notices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also explain some of the uncertainty regarding the health effects of coffee. Over the decades, science has struggled to make sense of coffee’s health effects, even though coffee is among the most studied beverages on Earth. One study &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/coffee-health-benefits-longevity/"&gt;says it’s good&lt;/a&gt; for your brain. Another links it to longer life. But then come warnings about cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even heart disease. For every headline declaring coffee a superfood, another whispers caution. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/27/18/1983/6125539"&gt;A part of this could be explained&lt;/a&gt; by how coffee is made; as researchers showed, even the same type of coffee (ie an espresso) can sometimes have very different cholesterol values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease. For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it’s clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable,” says Iggman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to make a healthy coffee&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way you make your coffee matters — a lot more than most people realize. A simple paper filter can intercept cholesterol-raising compounds and potentially lower your long-term &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1964" href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/staying-fit-heart-attack-16012019/"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and wondering whether you should switch to filtered coffee, the answer is probably ‘yes’. This isn’t the first study to come up with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-healthiest-way-to-brew-coffee"&gt;this conclusion&lt;/a&gt; and there seem to be only upsides to filtered coffee. Filtered coffee continues to show health benefits—or at least neutrality. Unfiltered coffee, on the other hand, is consistently linked to &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/unfiltered-coffee-may-be-increasing-your-ldl-cholesterol"&gt;higher cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and, in long-term studies, increased heart disease and mortality​.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this should be fairly easy and inexpensive to do. Here are some basic tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew coffee using paper filters, either in a drip machine or pour-over.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid regular use of metal-filtered methods like French press, moka pot, or percolator.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be cautious with espresso, especially in high quantities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At work, find out what kind of machine you’re using. If it’s a metal-filtered brewing system, consider alternatives — or bring your own filtered brew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your heart — and your future self — will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

across seven European countries, highlights a newly identified high-risk group often overlooked in national screening efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers say

rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&lt;/a&gt; levels in the blood could offer men earlier access to treatment, improving their chances of a cure and reducing the need for expensive treatments linked to advanced-stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term data consistently show that PSA screening can lower the risk of dying from prostate cancer by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new research, from the world’s largest prostate cancer screening study, however, researchers looked at 20 years of data to see how often saying no to prostate cancer screening affects the chances of dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on 20 years of data from over 160,000 men across seven European countries, the study highlighted a high-risk group often overlooked in national screening efforts: appointment avoiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study’s findings showed that over 12,400 people skipped their prostate screening appointments, leading to a 45% higher risk of

class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing not to take part in screening may stem from a complex combination of factors, according to the study’s lead author, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renee-Leenen-2" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renee-Leenen-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener

Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.erspc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;The European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (ERSPC) was initiated in the early 1990s to assess the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening on prostate cancer (PCa) mortality at a population level. In this secondary analysis, we aimed to get insight into the risk of dying of PCa in screening non-attenders using long-term data from the ERSPC,” Leenen told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the ERSPC, men were randomized to either a screening arm (invited for screening/PSA test) or control arm (not offered screening/PSA test),” Leenen continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of the 72,460 men randomized to the SA, 12,401 (17%) did not attend any of the screening rounds offered. We found that men who were offered screening (randomised to the screening arm) but did not attend population-based screening (screening arm non-attenders) are at 39% higher risk of dying from PCa compared to men that were not offered screening (in the control arm).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Renée Leenen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a consequence, non-attendance may be the biggest counteracting factor to the successful implementation of population-based screening programs for (prostate) cancer,” Leenen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nilesh Vora, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified hematologist and medical oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, not involved in this research, described these new findings as “fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower death risk by attending screenings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has long been controversy over whether PSA screening is helpful in a disease that we’ve long labeled as ‘one that most patients will die with, rather than die from,’ but this study seems to suggest a 23% decrease in mortality specifically from prostate cancer in men who engage in screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Nilesh Vora, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The age of the population at hand — 55-69 represents one that are candidates for aggressive treatments if prostate cancer is found and thus, should be the target for prostate cancer screening in future studies that could validate this trial,” Vora noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although these results are yet to be peer-reviewed, Vora is looking forward to the full results being published later this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For any screening program to be effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 70% of the population needs to be exposed to the screening test,” Leenen pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, current cancer screening programs low and declining participation rates,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-attendance may also be one of the biggest counteracting factors when it comes to successful screening for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that men who were offered screening but did not attend population-based screening are at higher risk of dying from PCa compared to men that were not offered screening. Consequently, non-attendance may be the biggest counteracting factor to the successful implementation of population-based screening programmes for (prostate) cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Renée Leenen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hence, there is an urgent need for further qualitative research to explore screening non-attenders and understand why, although being offered screening, they opted not to attend population-based screening,” Leenen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could inform tailored intervention to address awareness, informed participation and inequalities in access,” Dr. Leened added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force discouraged people from undergoing prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening due to overteratment and overdiagnosis from the years before.

We know that the reduction in prostate cancer screening during that time period led to prostate cancer getting diagnosed at higher grades and stages,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this updated, ERSPC study, the take-home point is that the over 12,000 men who effectively did not follow any recommended screening guidelines, had a nearly a 40% higher risk of death related to prostate cancer. The study reinforces the fact that prostate cancer screening reduces the risk of dying from prostate cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ramkishen Narayanan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is still left up to interpretation is the best practical application of PSA screening for the average man. The urologic community in the United States has adopted a shared decision-making pathway with patients about prostate cancer screening, namely, allowing patients to feel empowered to start and stop PSA screening with the guidance of their trusted physician,” Narayanan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you shouldn’t skip a screening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prostate cancer screening trials and population-based screening programs/events were utilized in the U.S. in the past but fell out of favor due to the undisciplined management of results and subsequent treatment. In the contemporary era, where patients are more informed to the point of being inundated with recommendations, I believe the study here sends a clear signal through the noise — ignoring prostate cancer screening will significantly increase a man’s risk of dying from prostate cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ramkishen Narayanan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:30:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxORkJ3blhKWXZfcUZ3OFR1by1iVG1ydkVqOXRfTXFOZVNObTZxaUw4MlZWa0ZFMDdBdGZjSm9Tbnd5amo4dGItckM4RHo5ZGlNWC02bm9vdXZsR1BnTFVHUl95aTdfSlZNa092LUVqYUxBUnpNazd3bXJ2TEJyMUl1eVJHVm8yb25JYVQtRkEtMkpOZw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists find drug that makes human blood poisonous to mosquitos - Euronews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxNMU5FZERZQk1TNzgxZ3lIN1BYYnBSTXJHRkhUX1hBcHhKQmJxYzlfYjFfdHBYVjhNb0x6d2k4ZWlDaEV2MjFkSWZtRkVxSFZCYTR0VWNkMzJkSGtMWHdkVzNFN0tBaDJtSF8tdUozQk5MckZid2JmbUZTSC1FT1daaHhDTG1QX0tOUlNhbk1ZMUNzck5McjI3eV8tU2FaSGwxaFdWMkx1WEIzd1ZMRHJuM0RoUXF1UlV2blM3SUZiMDZsX2YwWXZPejMtclRuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-summary"&gt;
        "One way to stop the spread of diseases transmitted by insects is to make the blood of animals and humans toxic," according to researchers.

However, its repeated use can lead to drug-resistance. It can also be toxic for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nitisinone performance was fantastic," said Álvaro Acosta Serrano, professor of biological sciences at Notre Dame and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has a much longer half-life in human blood than ivermectin, which means its mosquitocidal activity remains circulating in the human body for much longer. This is critical when applied in the field for safety and economical reasons," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitisinone was able to kill mosquitoes across all age groups, including older mosquitoes that are most likely to transmit malaria. It was also capable of eliminating insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the future, it could be advantageous to alternate both nitisinone and ivermectin for mosquito control," Haines said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, nitisinone could be employed in areas where ivermectin resistance persists or where ivermectin is already heavily used for livestock and humans".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito-borne diseases include malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, chikungunya and yellow fever, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They represent an emerging threat to human health in Europe with climate change creating more favourable conditions for invasive mosquito species despite malaria being eradicated from the continent for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:13:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxNMU5FZERZQk1TNzgxZ3lIN1BYYnBSTXJHRkhUX1hBcHhKQmJxYzlfYjFfdHBYVjhNb0x6d2k4ZWlDaEV2MjFkSWZtRkVxSFZCYTR0VWNkMzJkSGtMWHdkVzNFN0tBaDJtSF8tdUozQk5MckZid2JmbUZTSC1FT1daaHhDTG1QX0tOUlNhbk1ZMUNzck5McjI3eV8tU2FaSGwxaFdWMkx1WEIzd1ZMRHJuM0RoUXF1UlV2blM3SUZiMDZsX2YwWXZPejMtclRuQQ</guid></item><item><title>Can Triathlon Training Turn Back the Clock on Your Biological Age? - Triathlete</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPNDRnMzVqNUpQSV9pdXg0TEh1VTFFc3cyc1c0MjZRbHpmSXlpU0JGVDdObFdYUW9meWRRd0RwejV1SXNjcXBuTlBzT0JWeEtBZmhoeFBybS1aSDRCSXQyaDBPRFhIOFh1Zm9GNFhVT1pKQk9LMG9PdWcwaEhFLUxzZm91My14RTZBU1p3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-rte-text u-spacing--and-half c-content__post js-fitvids js-article-body " data-inject-ads data-inject-ads-options="{ &amp;quot;markup&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;&amp;lt;div class='js-ad js-hide-elements js-visible-signed-out o-ad c-ad--inline' data-child-zone='in-content-leaderboard-tri' data-size='[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[300,50],[300,100],[728,90],[320,50],[320,100],[468,60],[300,250],[1,1]]' data-size-map='[[[1145,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[728,90],[468,60],[1,1]]],[[850,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[468,60],[1,1]]],[[0,0],[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[300,250],[320,100],[300,100],[320,50],[300,50],[1,1]]]]' data-hide-elements='.o-banner-ad__vertical .js-ad'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;quot;], &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;nextExceptions&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;img, blockquote, div&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nextContainsExceptions&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;img, blockquote, a.btn, a.o-button&amp;quot;} }"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Netflix documentary &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81757532" data-afl-p="0"&gt;“Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever”&lt;/a&gt; follows the story of Bryan Johnson, a 47-year-old man who has devoted his time, energy, and sizable wealth to the pursuit of anti-aging. To date, Johnson claims to have achieved “perfect biomarkers” and reversed his biological age by five years. Make no mistake – this is no whimsical Peter Pan story, but a pseudoscientific quest to turn back one’s biological clock through a rigorous fasting routine, supplements, experimental treatments, and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how much exercise does it take to reverse your biological age? Surprisingly little, according to Johnson. In the documentary, Johnson references a daily 45-60 minute routine of 25 exercises plus brief HIIT, which he describes in more detail on his YouTube channel. Throw in an occasional hike or two, and the exercise box is checked for anti-aging (you will, of course, need to spend many more hours and dollars to check the other boxes in Johnson’s &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/?_ab=0&amp;amp;_fd=0&amp;amp;_sc=1" data-afl-p="0"&gt;“Don’t Die Protocol”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For endurance athletes in the thick of training, six hours of exercise per week might feel a little light, and triathletes are notoriously aversive to strength training, preferring to spend their time in steady Zone 2 efforts. But many get into endurance sports to get healthy, live longer, and feel younger. It begs the question: If a little exercise is good for anti-aging, is a lot better? We asked Laura Kunces, vice president of medical strategy at &lt;a href="https://www.thorne.com/who-we-are" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt; to break down what endurance athletes need to know about how training affects biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time that has elapsed since the day you were born is your chronological age – in other words, the age that aligns with what’s on your birth certificate or driver’s license. From a health and medical standpoint, chronological age is helpful in understanding whether a symptom or issue is typical or atypical for the person experiencing it. Changes to vision in a 20-year-old might be alarming; in a 50-year-old, it might simply signal a common age-related condition known as presbyopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological age is different, says Kunces: “Your biological age is how your cells are looking from an age standpoint. As we age chronologically, oftentimes we also age biologically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t always happen at the same rate. Your cells may look or act younger or older than your chronological age in response to diet or lifestyle. This might also be visible without a blood sample or microscope – if you’ve ever met an 80-year-old triathlete who moves with the energy and alertness of a 50-year-old, that’s biological aging in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to quantify your biological age, multiple tests are available – usually through &lt;a href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/at-home-health-tests-reviewed/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;blood analysis like Function Health or Thorne&lt;/a&gt; – to give you a number that shows what your biological age is relative to chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is my biological age? Measurement methods explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Biological age is a buzzy term out there, and different people have different tests and different ways to look at it,” Kunces says. There is no one widely-accepted measurement tool for biological age, perhaps because the science is new, having been first introduced in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4015143/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;scientific paper in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no gold standard for measuring biological age, and the tests that do exist are best-guess models. Some ways tests measure biological age include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Telomere length, or DNA structures at the end of chromosomes that shorten as a person ages; longer telomere length may indicate a longer lifespan, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242319300034?via%3Dihub" data-afl-p="0"&gt;according to some studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;A variety of biomarkers to calculate biological age. Researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12849085/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;have identified 16 biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; that could be used in calculating biological age,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Others have come up with their own way of testing. Thorne, for example, uses what Kunces calls “an extremely large database of blood biomarkers from individuals of all ages, all lifestyles, all backgrounds, all ethnicities” and a “&lt;a href="https://www.thorne.com/take-5-daily/article/how-does-thornes-biological-age-test-work" data-afl-p="0"&gt;complex algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to help understand how you compare to other people from a clinical biomarker standpoint.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;Artificial intelligence is also identifying new ways to measure biological age in &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-enabled-ekgs-find-difference-between-numerical-age-and-biological-age-significantly-affects-health-longevity/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;health tests like EKGs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/are-you-aging-faster-than-you-should-new-ai-reveals-your-true-biological-age-from-5-drops-of-blood/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;hormone metabolism pathways in the blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What factors affect biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there’s no way to avoid aging altogether, there are some consistent factors that contribute to the speed at which we age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diet: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8754996/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; a person’s diet might be the biggest factor in determining how fast (or slow) a person ages. Though no one specific proven “biological aging diet” exists, experts mostly agree it’s a good idea to get a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daily habits: &lt;/b&gt;What you do each day may accelerate (or decelerate) biological aging. Studies have found factors, including exercise, smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" data-afl-p="0"&gt;living conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10650967/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;social relationships&lt;/a&gt; can affect the way we age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does endurance training affect biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_496508" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-lazy-load fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-496508" data-src="https://cdn.triathlete.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2416a22d-87df-46eb-adc6-48bcc84ac412.jpg?width=730" alt="Triathletes with their diversity of training might have a good matrix for a lower biological age. But it requires attention to strength training, rest and recovery - something athletes in our sport are notoriously bad at."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption "&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Triathlon training can present a good wellness matrix for a lower biological age. But it requires attention to strength training, rest, and recovery – something athletes in our sport are notoriously bad at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good for the body, in more ways than one. &lt;a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/16726/text/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Physical activity has been found to affect telomere length&lt;/a&gt; (one marker of biological age) for the better, and &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" data-afl-p="0"&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt; show exercise habits in general are a good predictor of longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, yes, of course, exercise is going to help you live longer,” Kunces says. “But there are so many nuances to that, though, because amount, volume, duration, and intensity play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triathletes, who by nature of their chosen sport, get a good variety of workouts in a given week with swims, bikes, and runs of varying lengths and intensities. Kunces says that’s a “good situation,” but also warns triathletes against falling into the trap of believing more is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Triathletes might start to see things change in their biological age or biomarkers when they’re either overdoing it or under-recovering,” says Kunces. “Not giving the body a chance to recover from the exercise you’re doing could put unnecessary stress on the body and increase inflammation, which will ultimately change the structure and function of a lot of these cells that you’re looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, exercise will often improve certain hormone levels in the body, improving biological age. But too much – whether in duration, intensity, or frequency – &lt;a href="https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/153-autumn-24/features/overtraining-and-the-endocrine-system-can-hormones-indicate-overtraining/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;can cause hormone levels to go haywire&lt;/a&gt;, leading to accelerated aging (For more on this, &lt;a href="https://www.triathlete.com/training/the-endocrine-system-is-every-triathletes-best-friend-or-worst-enemy/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;read Jill Colangelo’s breakdown of how overtraining affects the endocrine system and HPA axis&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kunces says training for and racing longer-distance triathlon events might also affect other biomarkers measured in biological age tests: “In longer-length triathlons, you might start to see changes with iron and things like that. There is such a thing as sports anemia, where you’re crushing red blood cells and there might be higher turnover of certain red blood cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Johnson might be onto something with his less-is-more approach to exercise, but even Ironman triathletes can likely see their biological age go down, so long as they ensure proper recovery. Remember, multiple factors affect biological age, including diet, sleep, and stress. Taking a holistic approach to training with appropriate nutrition and recovery methods can mitigate the effects of endurance training on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery aspect is where Kunces sees the biggest benefit of biological aging tests for athletes: “It is just a way to gauge how things are going; I’ve been training for an Ironman over the last four months. What’s going on with my blood? Should I be doing this differently, do I need to change my diet? Just making sure an athlete is getting enough sleep and recovery can influence some of these biomarkers. We know that inflammation can be more exuberant with less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other big example is nutrition. Especially in the endurance community, you’re consuming a lot of carbohydrates. So making sure that the amount you’re consuming, the timing, and quality of those is appropriate for you, because if not, you’re going to see changes in how you’ve been metabolizing those carbohydrates over time. It’s a way to see if what you’re doing is working for you, and if not, what you should be changing to make sure you’re getting the right stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can endurance athletes reverse biological aging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of anti-aging is full of silver bullets and supplements, and it’s important to note that as of this writing, none have been definitively proven to reduce biological age. Studies show many common supplements &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2/full" data-afl-p="0"&gt;have no effect on life expectancy (and may even increase mortality risk)&lt;/a&gt;, and though some &lt;a href="https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/5138" data-afl-p="0"&gt;already-established medications show promise in anti-aging applications&lt;/a&gt; for some populations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any for anti-aging use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why it’s so hard to find a singular fountain of youth is the same reason why different testing companies use different biomarkers for calculating biological age – there is no one singular hallmark of aging, but a cascade of changes across different systems, affected by each individual’s genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Because there’s no one way to age, there’s no one way to anti-age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to find your way, do you really need to spend $2 million per year on anti-aging protocols to address them all, as Johnson has? Not quite. Though longevity science is still very much a work in progress, experts generally agree most people can simply focus on the fundamentals if they want to have a longer, healthier lifespan: eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and find ways to manage your physical and emotional stress.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Dr. Sofiya Milman spends her days studying some of the longest-living people on the planet — humans who are living proof that it's possible to live decades past the average American lifespan of 75 to 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she's learned so far — about lifestyle but particularly about DNA — is opening up avenues that could lead to a new era of antiaging treatments for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have people who live to 100 and are healthy, so our bodies are capable. It's biologically plausible, therefore we just have to tweak things to get us there," she told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman, the director of human longevity studies at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is leading a study to recruit 10,000 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;age 95 and older, along with their relatives, to find out what makes them live longer and healthier lives than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "super-agers" may owe their long lives to luck and good genes, but studying them could help scientists give the rest of us a biological edge, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then we can have a drug that will benefit the other 99.9% of the population that didn't win the genetic lottery and wasn't lucky enough to inherit that gene," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, don't get sidetracked by common misconceptions about living longer. Here's what Milman said really works (and doesn't) for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0" data-toc-id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging isn't inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can't control the passage of time, medications and treatments could help us delay, prevent, or even reverse the process of getting older, at least in the sense of becoming frail or ill over time, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People do not recognize the fact that there is a biology that drives aging and that you can actually manipulate that biology," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have medications to treat conditions including high blood pressure and high cholesterol — some of them, such as statins, have &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-tricks-longevity-expert-reduced-longevity-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;antiaging benefits&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors may one day have even more treatments for age-related decline, and sooner than you may think. Milman is hopeful that we'll start to see viable options in the next decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really not science fiction anymore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8" data-toc-id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthspan is more important than lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 65, a majority of Americans have at least one chronic illness such as arthritis, diabetes, cognitive decline, or cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;No one wants to live to 100 if they can't get out of bed or engage with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think most people would argue the more important thing here is healthspan. How many years of healthy life free of chronic conditions do you have?" Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super-agers are a perfect example of an &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-doctor-reversed-biological-age-15-years-eats-avoids-mediterranean-2025-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ideal healthspan&lt;/a&gt;, able to stave off dementia, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer for 10 or even 20 years later than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not only living longer, they're actually living healthier," Milman said — and that can hold lessons for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b" data-toc-id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of centenarians drink alcohol and snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, centenarians are just like the rest of the population, even when it comes to unhealthy lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They drink same amount of alcohol, they exercise the same, no less, no more, they're just as likely to be overweight. They're not less likely to smoke. And so there isn't a lifestyle feature that we can say, well, if you do that, then you'll live to be a hundred," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as genetics, and even good luck, seem to play a big role in getting people over the 100-year mark, more than any specific &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/advice-live-longer-centenarians-luck-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;centenarian habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman said studying centenarians had been a poignant reminder to herself about focusing on the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;little habits&lt;/a&gt; that can make a big difference for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the time being, I need to be doing everything that has been shown to help us live longer and healthier, so exercising, eating a healthy diet, reducing stress in my life, and getting enough sleep," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac" data-toc-id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise is really important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you skip your workout or have an extra glass of whiskey, Milman said healthy habits might be even more important if you aren't lucky enough to be naturally long-living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifestyle is important for 99.9% of us who don't have longevity genes. So there's indisputable evidence that leading the healthy lifestyle will allow you to live longer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While science may not guarantee you'll live to 100, you can &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plant-based-mediterranean-diet-add-ten-years-longevity-modeling-study-2022-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; with habits such as eating a diet high in nutrient-dense whole foods including produce, nuts and seeds, and high-quality protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're going to prioritize only one habit for living longer and healthier, it should be exercise, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough physical activity will give you more bang for your buck in terms of health benefits, she said, and the best kind of exercise is one you'll do consistently, whether that's walking with friends or lifting weights in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

It used to be rare to diagnose a 15-year-old with fatty liver disease, but today it's routine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Modern diets high in processed foods, saturated fats, sugary drinks and red or processed meats, alongside a decline in physical activity, contribute significantly to the rise in fatty liver disease among children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="7bhmk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="89emb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Western diets are overloaded with processed foods and unhealthy fats, while intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains remains low," Ishach-Adiv explains. "It’s not just about what we eat—it’s also about what we don’t do. Kids today move less than ever. A sedentary lifestyle, with excessive screen time and little physical activity, directly impacts energy balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="398eq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although genetics can play a role, it is not the primary cause. "Some cases stem from genetic disorders, but these are rare," she says.

"A child or adult can have fatty liver disease without realizing it," Ishach-Adiv says. "It develops quietly and doesn’t cause discomfort until complications arise."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The condition is often detected through routine checkups, particularly in overweight children or those with unexplained symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6uqgk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="45no4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Ultrasounds combined with blood tests can reveal fatty infiltration in the liver. Elevated liver enzymes in blood tests may also signal the disease," she says. "Sometimes, children are diagnosed after being examined for unrelated stomach pain." Early detection is crucial, as lifestyle changes can prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eton8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fatty liver disease isn’t a life sentence — it’s a warning sign. "I tell families that this is an opportunity to make changes before it’s too late," Ishach-Adiv stressed. "It’s a chance to adjust not only the child’s habits but the entire family’s. Many times, siblings and parents also adopt healthier lifestyles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="983th-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The primary treatment isn’t medication but dietary and lifestyle modifications. "Some children with severe obesity or metabolic syndrome may receive weight-loss treatments and there are options for adults. However, the best long-term solution remains a healthy diet and regular physical activity," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4djce-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dietary recommendations include shifting from processed foods to a more natural, Mediterranean-style diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. "Reducing animal fats, avoiding preservatives and artificial colors and prioritizing plant-based fats significantly improve liver function in children," she explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6h017-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The earlier the intervention, the easier it is to maintain healthy habits. "Convincing a 15-year-old to stop drinking chocolate milk and eat healthily is challenging," Dr. Ishach-Adiv says.

&lt;p&gt;A Michigan resident died of rabies contracted from an organ they were donated, state health officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unidentified patient died in January, a month after getting the transplant at a hospital in Ohio, Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services told The Post on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A public health investigation determined they contracted rabies through the transplanted organ,” Sutfin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials have not identified the recipient or said what type of organ transplant they received.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health departments in both Michigan and Ohio “worked closely” together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the investigation into the patient’s death, Sutfin told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was also confirmed by the CDC’s Rabies Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies,” Sutfin said in a statement. “Post-exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided.”&lt;/p&gt;

No tunnel, white light, etc. Just saw the truck coming at me, and then I was in the hospital.

I actually don't recall what I felt very well. I know I was angry. I realized I was going to die, but I didn't want to accept it. All I recall after falling through the ice was anger. It felt like forever, just punching the ice. I couldn't find the hole I fell in from either. It was so cold, the coldest I've ever been. Right as things were greying out, I tried one more time. I pushed off the ice to go down. I found a rock, or maybe it was a stick. I can't remember. I hit the ice a few more times before it broke. Walking back for nearly an hour in the cold and snow and in wet clothes probably almost killed me too, in hindsight. The whole experience and the month afterward of being sick in bed are a blur. Just a lot of shivering."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Douglas Rissing / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7qas1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ellisonpark;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ellisonpark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It was less dramatic than fainting.

I got caught in the current and couldn't swim out, nor could I grab something to hang onto. I couldn't hold my breath any longer, so death began to sink in once my mouth was full of water. The natural instinct is to open your mouth for air, but it mind-fucked me knowing all I was gonna get was water. At some point, I see someone dive underwater near me and pull me out. It was my cousin who had to walk me back to the rest of the party with my family. I was in a daze for the rest of the day. My dad freaked the fuck out if I remember correctly. Nobody knew I was seconds from being dead. I don't like strong currents unless it's a water park."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; ANGHI / Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"How it felt: I was just a kid who didn't understand life and death yet. I knew how to swim and was taught to just keep your head above water. It fucking sucked not knowing how to feel.

Both times from an allergy to anesthetic, and both when I was younger and during some routine surgeries. I was put under, and my heart had stopped due to the allergy.

I lost 24 hours of my life because I succumbed to anemia. Before I passed out, I was fighting to stay awake with all my might. Then, a sense of both utter peace and utter calm came over me. Even at that tender age, I knew that day would be my last, and I accepted it. Then, I wake up in a hospital with one burning question, 'Is this heaven?' The strangest thing about coming from a nearly dead state to breathing is it changes a person. You experience utter peace.

I decided to take a long run-up from the end of the street. I got the speedometer on my bicycle up to 30 mph right before I hit the ramp. In the air, I screwed up, though. I leaned too far forward and went over the handlebars. I landed head-first on the concrete and slid about 10 feet. The last thing I remember before it all went black was seeing the ground in front of my bike. I woke up in the hospital six hours later. I'm not sure about the specifics, but I remember being told I flatlined. They had to bring me back in the ambulance. I came out of it with a serious concussion, no skin on my face, and a lot of pain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don't remember anything between it going black and waking up. It was not like sleeping. It's like a scene change on TV. One moment, I was there. The next moment, I was in hospital. Not darkness, not a feeling.

They were sent to the NICU while I stayed in the hospital with high blood pressure. Three days later, I awoke and found it difficult to breathe. I summoned the nurse to the room. My breathing grew more and more difficult. What sounded like a raging river swirled in my head. As more and more people entered my hospital room, I hoped someone was going to be able to help me. I realized I was going to die. I felt peaceful but extremely sad that I wasn't going to be in my children's lives. I thought about how strange it was that it didn't hurt that I couldn't breathe. Then I collapsed. I awoke the next day on a ventilator in an ICU in a different hospital. I was told I had suffered heart failure and had six liters of fluid removed from my lungs. l ended up in the ICU for nine days, then transferred back to the women's hospital where my babies were."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; SerrNovik / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"My nurse, who had been on duty the night I had heart failure, came to see me and told me I had been completely gray and unresponsive until intubated. Eventually, my sons and I were all released from the hospital. The thing that stayed with me was the feeling I had not actually survived. It took me well over a year to realize I was alive. It was a very strange feeling of floating through life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7v55p/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Walker-mama;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Walker-mama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;14.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When I was six, I had a tonsillectomy due to an unknown bleeding disorder. I had bleeding spells but nothing serious until right before Christmas. We were out cutting a tree when my throat collapsed, and I began to throw up buckets of blood. So much that they couldn't empty them fast enough. I remember my mom holding me and crying as my eyes rolled back in my head. Everything went black, and then a piercing light and warmth washed over me. My last words were, 'It's OK, Mom. Don't worry. It's nice here. They're going to keep me safe until I get back.' I was flown in a medivac chopper to Little Rock, Arkansas. At some point, I was clinically dead and then on a respirator for just over a month."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Honestly, other than the last thing I spoke and the warmth from the light, I don't remember anything until the pain from the catheter they put in after the respirator. I definitely would like to have stayed unconscious for it.

The person performing the hole watch tied me to a truck when he got called to another part of the work site. (I assume so that the rope wouldn't fall in the hole.) The truck started to drive off with me tied to it. I screamed for help while I was pulled straight up to the top of the manhole opening. As the harness was getting tighter and tighter, I breathed out, but I couldn't breathe in as the harness got tighter. It was like being bear-hugged by a very strong person. I remember feeling very calm and thinking, 'This is how it ends,' before the truck stopped and backed up. Then the slack let in, and I fell 15 feet to the bottom of the sump.

Lauren Leffer, who recently &lt;a href="/science/632605/forever-war-with-bird-flu"&gt;wrote a piece for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about bird flu&lt;/a&gt; and how it’s becoming a forever war, is joining me on the show, and we’re going to talk about the systems, structure, and culture that might control bird flu — and those that might make it worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;You’ve most likely heard about bird flu in the context of egg prices. Eggs are expensive and hard to find right now because the bird flu has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/egg-prices-restaurants.html"&gt;kicked off an old fashioned supply and demand problem&lt;/a&gt;: the virus kills almost every single chicken it infects; fewer chickens means fewer eggs, and fewer eggs means higher prices. You’ll hear Lauren say &lt;a href="https://www.levernews.com/animal-farm-eggflations-monopoly-problem/"&gt;it’s a little more complicated than that&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s the basic shape of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;But the bird flu is actually quite a bit more serious than just the egg supply. The first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/health/bird-flu-death-louisiana.html"&gt;confirmed human death linked to the virus&lt;/a&gt; happened in January. Now, we’re facing some uncomfortable questions with no easy answers. Like how rapidly the new strains of bird flu, known collectively as H5N1, might be spreading from birds to dairy cows and other animals, as well as just how deadly those new strains are among both birds and mammals, including human beings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;If you’re like me, you’re starting to feel some uncomfortably familiar feelings, and you’re not wrong to feel them. There are some real echoes of COVID-19 here — and the Trump administration, with Robert Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, is not at all equipped to handle a fast-moving pathogenic virus. Kennedy himself is an anti-vaccine activist who peddles junk science with abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;Kennedy went on &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and suggested one way to deal with ongoing bird flu outbreaks was to simply let it spread and kill all the birds, which is a purely stupid idea for a variety of reasons you’ll hear Lauren discuss. Certainly not helping the matter is that on Thursday, just a few days after Lauren and I talked for this episode, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a major workforce reduction of HHS, with layoffs hitting 10,000 employees in a move Kennedy said would a “a painful period” for the department that would involve doing “more with less.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;On top of all that, the messy aftermath of the pandemic and the damage done to institutional trust across the board would make the job difficult for even a credible leader of our public health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;But like I said, I wanted to talk about this in a &lt;em&gt;Decoder &lt;/em&gt;framework, and there’s one big difference from COVID-19 that I wanted to push on here: industrial agriculture in the US is a big business, and the bird flu is a threat to that business. Millions of dead birds represent millions in lost revenue, and if the virus becomes more deadly to dairy cows, that’s even more money on the line. So if the government isn’t capable of mounting a response, is the industry capable of seeing and solving this problem before it becomes even worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The answer, as you might expect, is a resounding question mark, but as you’ll hear Lauren explain, different parts of the market are reacting differently.

This loss of reward dampens the desire for high-calorie foods, potentially worsening obesity by promoting habitual, joyless eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, restoring neurotensin levels reversed this effect, improving weight control and eating behavior. The findings highlight a brain mechanism behind obesity and open new avenues for targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurotensin’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity is linked to reduced neurotensin in brain regions tied to food reward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restored Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinstating neurotensin in obese mice revived food enjoyment and normalized eating patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting neurotensin pathways may lead to precise, side-effect-free obesity treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pleasure we get from eating junk food — the dopamine rush from crunching down on salty, greasy French fries and a luscious burger — is often blamed as the cause of overeating and rising obesity rates in our society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a new study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that pleasure in eating, even eating junk food, is key for maintaining a healthy weight in a society that abounds with cheap, high-fat food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108262"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and junk food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers then tested ways to restore neurotensin levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, anecdotal evidence suggests that people with obesity may take less pleasure in eating than those of normal weight. Brain scans of obese individuals show reduced activity in pleasure-related brain regions when presented with food, a pattern also observed in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, UC Berkeley researchers have identified a possible underlying cause of this phenomenon — a decline in neurotensin, a brain peptide that interacts with the dopamine network — and a potential strategy to restore pleasure in eating in a way that helps reduce overall consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals an unsuspected brain mechanism that explains why a chronic high-fat diet can reduce the desire for high-fat, sugary foods, even when these foods remain easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that this lack of desire in obese individuals is due to a loss of pleasure in eating caused by long-term consumption of high-calorie foods. Losing this pleasure may actually contribute to the progression of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A natural inclination toward junk food is not inherently bad — but losing it could further exacerbate obesity,” said Stephan Lammel, a UC Berkeley professor in the Department of Neuroscience and a member of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this effect is driven by a reduction in neurotensin in a specific brain region that connects to the dopamine network. Importantly, they demonstrate that restoring neurotensin levels — either through dietary changes or genetic manipulations that enhance neurotensin production — can reinstate the pleasure in eating and promote weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A high-fat diet changes the brain, leading to lower neurotensin levels, which in turn alters how we eat and respond to these foods,” Lammel said. “We found a way to restore the desire for high-calorie foods, which may actually help with weight management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While findings in mice don’t always translate directly to humans, this discovery could open new avenues for addressing obesity by restoring food-related pleasure and breaking unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine eating an amazing dessert at a great restaurant in Paris — you experience a burst of dopamine and happiness,” said Neta Gazit Shimoni, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this same feeling occurs in mice on a normal diet, but is missing in those on a high-fat diet. They may keep eating out of habit or boredom, rather than genuine enjoyment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazit Shimoni and former UC Berkeley graduate student Amanda Tose are co-first authors, and Lammel is senior author of the study, which will be published March 26 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving a long-standing puzzle in obesity research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors and researchers have struggled to understand and treat obesity, as countless fad diets and eating regimens have failed to produce long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent success of GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic, which curb appetite by increasing feelings of fullness, stands out among many failed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lammel studies brain circuits, particularly the dopamine network, which plays a crucial role in reward and motivation. Dopamine is often associated with pleasure, reinforcing our desire to seek rewarding experiences, such as consuming high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While raising mice on a high-fat diet, Gazit Shimoni noticed a striking paradox: While in their home cages, these mice strongly preferred high-fat chow, which contained 60% fat, over normal chow with only 4% fat, leading them to gain excessive weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when they were taken out of their home cages and given free access to high-calorie treats such as butter, peanut butter, jelly or chocolate, they showed much less desire to indulge than normal-diet mice, which immediately ate everything they were offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you give a normal, regular-diet mouse the chance, they will immediately eat these foods,” Gazit Shimoni said. “We only see this paradoxical attenuation of feeding motivation happening in mice on a high-fat diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discovered that this effect had been reported in past studies, but no one had followed up to find out why, and how the effect connects to the obesity phenotype observed in these mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring neurotensin reverses obesity-related brain changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this phenomenon, Lammel and his team used optogenetics, a technique that allows scientists to control brain circuits with light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that in normal-diet mice, stimulating a brain circuit that connects to the dopamine network increased their desire to eat high-calorie foods, but in obese mice, the same stimulation had no effect, suggesting that something must have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, they discovered, was that neurotensin was reduced so much in obese mice that it prevented dopamine from triggering the usual pleasure response to high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurotensin is this missing link,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, it enhances dopamine activity to drive reward and motivation. But in high-fat diet mice, neurotensin is downregulated, and they lose the strong desire to consume high-calorie foods — even when easily available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested ways to restore neurotensin levels. When obese mice were switched back to a normal diet for two weeks, their neurotensin levels returned to normal, dopamine function was restored, and they regained interest in high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When neurotensin levels were artificially restored using a genetic approach, the mice not only lost weight, but also showed reduced anxiety and improved mobility. Their feeding behavior also normalized, with increased motivation for high-calorie foods and a simultaneous reduction of their total food consumption in their home cages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bringing back neurotensin seems to be very, very critical for preventing the loss of desire to consume high-calorie foods,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t make you immune to getting obese again, but it would help to control eating behavior, to bring it back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward more precise treatments for obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although directly administering neurotensin could theoretically restore feeding motivation in obese individuals, neurotensin acts on many brain areas, raising the risk of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the researchers used gene sequencing, a technique that allowed them to identify specific genes and molecular pathways that regulate neurotensin function in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery provides crucial molecular targets for future obesity treatments, paving the way for more precise therapies that could selectively enhance neurotensin function without broad systemic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have the full genetic profile of these neurons and how they change with high-fat diets,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to explore pathways upstream and downstream of neurotensin to find precise therapeutic targets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lammel and Gazit Shimoni plan to expand their research to explore neurotensin’s role beyond obesity, investigating its involvement in diabetes and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bigger question is whether these systems interact across different conditions,” Gazit Shimoni said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How does starvation affect dopamine circuits? What happens in eating disorders? These are the questions we’re looking at next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other co-authors are Charlotte Seng, Tamás Lukacsovich and Csaba Földy of the University of Zurich in Switzerland; Yihan Jin and Lin Tian of UC Davis; Hongbin Yang of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China; Jeroen Verharen, Christine Liu, Michael Tanios, Eric Hu, Jonathan Read and Lilly Tang of UC Berkeley; and Byung Kook Lim of UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the McKnight Foundation, One Mind Foundation, Weill Neurohub, Rita Allen Foundation, Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation and National Institutes of Health (R01DA042889, U01NS120820, U01NS113295, R01NS121231, R01DA049787).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shimoni was supported by a Young Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92e0fee1f3fcf6f7e0e1d2f0f7e0f9f7fef7ebbcf7f6e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08748-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Changes in neurotensin signalling drive hedonic devaluation in obesity&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephan Lammel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in neurotensin signalling drive hedonic devaluation in obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals. However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:57:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBFNlR4UlZ5SjNsclBBUkl0VkFsME1IUGJDckh2YmxSdzl3c1pfdnBGRjJic3JtTGc5eFUzcDk4UjIyWkhhSGxhcFNYVjNQSDdmZ0wwN0NYWUx5anVnV2JuQk1IQU1vZUNZVzhNeE5JNlVTQTY4</guid></item><item><title>Type 2 Diabetes Rewires the Brain Like Early Alzheimer’s - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE84eElEblVSeHRtNDVUTHBObGhWSUZyODVXdzBmcUd1dXN5bndoTXVFcjVlQlRwMjluQlVhOEtyOU04RWpMdjBhc0NHcGlJenNnY3J3Q19laE9oQXZhV2V2RUdOTkdfRWkwRHpsaXpISQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that Type 2 diabetes may impair the brain’s reward and memory processing in ways that mirror early Alzheimer’s disease. The study focuses on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region responsible for motivation and emotional regulation, and its interaction with the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In diabetic rodent models, researchers observed muted reward signals and impaired memory processing linked to elevated blood sugar levels.

Scientists have long known that Type 2 diabetes patients are more prone to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The risk of developing Alzheimer’s is 65% higher in diabetics. But the exact link between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases has been poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108254"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team called their findings significant, given the importance of diet and lifestyle interventions to manage diabetes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UNLV research team went searching for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;’s Computational Properties of the Prefrontal Cortex Special Collection, it appears that diabetes weakens ACC function — suppressing reward perception and memory signals — and induces mild cognitive impairment similar to that observed during the brain’s progression towards Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diabetes may be altering the brain similarly to early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead researcher and UNLV psychology professor James Hyman. “Further research is needed but these findings have the potential to help researchers unlock clues to improved diagnostic or treatment strategies for the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds on the UNLV team’s previous research into the link between diabetes and Alzheimer’s, and represents the first time scientists have looked for clues within the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACC is associated with fundamental cognitive processes — ranging from motivation, decision making, and learning to goal-oriented behavior (such as tracking tasks and experiences over time), pleasure seeking, and reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACC’s role in regulating emotions also makes it integral to brain patterns observed in patients experiencing mood disorders and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain insight into the interplay between the ACC and high blood sugar levels, scientists observed brain activity and behavior in rodent models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that diabetics’ anticipation of a reward, such as a sweet treat, is heightened in comparison to healthy brains. Additionally, after receiving the reward, healthy-brained subjects pause to savor, while the diabetics quickly move on to the next reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists, hyperglycemic insulin levels appeared to impair the ACC’s information-processing ability surrounding rewards. The researchers pinpointed the weakened reward signal to a dampened input into the ACC from another key brain area for Alzheimer’s disease called the hippocampus, which is involved in spatial and autobiographical memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think the hippocampus tells the subject where it is location-wise, and the ACC tells the subject what it is doing and that it’s getting a reward,” Hyman said. “These things should come together and make the subject remember it was just in a special, rewarding location, but this doesn’t happen with the ones that have Type 2 diabetes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team called their findings significant, given the importance of diet and lifestyle interventions to manage diabetes. Globally, 1 in 10 people contend with the illness, and 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes — which is linked to obesity and can lead to chronic damage to nerves, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, study authors said, the hippocampus-to-ACC projection may be worth exploring as a treatment target for mood disorders to which the ACC is already linked. Hyman said his team’s research reveals direct evidence of muted reward processing and behaviors that are consistent with anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure — a common symptom of depression and Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said, the circuit between the ACC and hippocampus is integrally important during the early stages of Alzheimer’s pathology. His team plans to continue its investigation into the connection between the neurodegenerative disorder and weakened ACC function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease goes undetected for decades because our brains are good at finding ways to compensate. Before diagnosis, people behave normally despite having changes in information processing. We even observed that in this study,” Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diabetes and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d6bdb3afb9b8b8b7f8a5a3bbbbb3a4a596a3b8baa0f8b3b2a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keyonna Summers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unlv.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keyonna Summers – University of Nevada&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1546-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ACC reward location information is carried by hippocampal theta synchrony and suppressed in a Type 2 Diabetes mode&lt;/a&gt;l” by James Hyman et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACC reward location information is carried by hippocampal theta synchrony and suppressed in a Type 2 Diabetes model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (n=5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (n=3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits and a differential change in spatial coding properties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:17:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE84eElEblVSeHRtNDVUTHBObGhWSUZyODVXdzBmcUd1dXN5bndoTXVFcjVlQlRwMjluQlVhOEtyOU04RWpMdjBhc0NHcGlJenNnY3J3Q19laE9oQXZhV2V2RUdOTkdfRWkwRHpsaXpISQ</guid></item><item><title>Experts reveal the best milk for your body... and the favorite pushed by RFK Jr could be deadly - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPM0VWTWpkalpQS29lN1M5OXFFbzMtMi1rTnhJcV9CWjJta0NIRFc3Y0t5YkFVTU50MVE1WkNFVU5SZlJkZGNYcms0T3dXYlRscl8xendhcnB3bXBNa1FDSUlZZ3R6c1dVN1dhb3l1dzB6d21RVV9HZzctVWh1aEx3OXR0dzJteHFNVFpSMmJsSzFsdnZrVl9mWXRlM2FmWVhEQmZGNUVWQWg0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNeTZidFhLc3BOWlo1aE9HYlVoNWxIYjJINTRXczJPb3BjR3NaSTZ2OWNHYUQ3bEhuV3lsNHdnc3FMWGpIenVUOEJjdlN4NU5DVW9YTERfRmNaYkNtUVQzTFR2QS14MXF2eFF5cklnSlRCMVZOMFFIZnN0bEplUVF5Sjl6MlBGMUpweTNJRUQ3dXlzWkJIdFVrd242bmFnQkMzQ215YWpoWi1fY242Ry1V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Navigating the ever-expanding selection of milk and dairy alternatives can leave your head spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional cow’s milk, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10205161/New-studies-suggest-dairy-actually-GOOD-help-prevent-disease.html"&gt;a dietary staple&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, has fallen out of fashion, surpassed by trendy oat and nut milks, which have legions of wellness-minded and lactose-intolerant followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are dozens of types of animal- and plant-based milks to choose from, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12147359/From-cows-oat-soya-almond-dietician-reveals-milk-really-best-health.html"&gt;not all are created equally&lt;/a&gt;, with each affecting the body - and planet - differently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some, like almond milk, have high levels of bone-strengthening calcium but use an excess amount of water to make, while others, such as oat milk, cause a spike in blood sugar but have a very low environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the newest milk trend is unpasteurized -or raw milk. Pasteurization involves heating raw milk to kill off bacteria that can cause harm, such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-a1320040-0a77-11f0-a887-330375410b2e"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, salmonella, and listeria, resulting in the safer-to-drink milk lining grocery store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But raw milk, which as been promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, does not underdo this process and poses a severe health risk as it can be contaminated with dangerous pathogens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, dietician Maya Feller &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://goop.com/wellness/health/which-milk-is-best-for-your-body-and-the-planet/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Goop the best way to choose which milk to buy is up to the individual consumer, who knows their health best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com breaks down the ins and outs of the most popular milks on the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are dozens of types of animal- and plant-based milks to choose from, but not all are created equally, with each affecting the body differently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Cow’s milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Milk Classic. As far as types of milk go, it’s the most nutrient-dense, offering up a healthy dose of protein – around eight grams per one eight-ounce glass – about 30 percent of daily calcium needs, as well as phosphorus, and vitamin B2, which help strengthen bones and provide energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Milk has long been associated with strong, healthy bones. It was the bedrock of the mega-popular Got Milk campaign in the '90s and early 2000s, featuring the cast of Friends, Simpsons characters, and the Williams’ sisters with prominent milk mustaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Got Milk campaign has become an indelible piece of American pop culture, solidifying milk as a foundational part of a healthy diet and making it a kitchen staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes in several forms - whole, reduced fat, low-fat and fat-free, also called skim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Poland linked it with a lower risk of bone density loss in old age. They &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738995/"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that consuming dairy products regularly during preschool and school years was linked to a higher probability of having better bone mineral density as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the high protein content, in addition to helping you feel fuller, is a major benefit for bone health. A 2013 study in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/association-of-total-protein-intake-with-bone-mineral-density-and-bone-loss-in-men-and-women-from-the-framingham-offspring-study/F56B457B9D540CFCB088C1F2313ACB61"&gt;Public Health Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found women who ate a high-protein diet were more likely to have a healthy bone mineral density than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cow’s milk also contains potassium and magnesium, which help &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.115.002787"&gt;protect against stroke&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s not all good news. Like many foods, there are benefits and drawbacks to traditional cow’s milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High dairy intake has been linked with an increased likelihood of dying from &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6204.long"&gt;heart disease and cancer&lt;/a&gt; - so this type of milk is best consumed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard University physicians found that drinking a lot of skim or low-fat milk was associated with a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6204.long"&gt;slightly higher risk of death&lt;/a&gt; from all causes and poor cardiovascular health, as well as lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite its benefits, cow's milk isn't for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 30 and 50 million Americans have some degree of intolerance for lactose, the type of sugar found in milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with lactose intolerance do not make enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest milk sugars. Luckily, however, the alternative milk market has exploded in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The latest buzz is about raw, unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization heats milk to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, making store-bought milk safer to drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A rising star in the milk market is raw milk, the unpasteurized, bacteria-laden version of common cow's milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through his Make American Health Again initiative, RFK Jr has revived public appetite for raw milk, which can carry potentially deadly bacteria, particularly among those more willing to seek alternative and natural medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite studies and real-world case reports pointing to the dangers of drinking raw milk, RFK has slammed the FDA for what he sees as 'aggressive suppression... of raw milk' as part of the agency's 'war on public health.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Silvia Caswell, associate program director of the preventive medicine residency program at Loma Linda University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.llu.edu/health-wellness/raw-milk-%C2%AD%E2%80%93-why-experts-say-you-shouldnt-drink-it#:~:text=Despite%20the%20benefits%20of%20pasteurization,and%20Salmonella%2C%22%20Caswell%20said."&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'Raw milk can expose individuals to harmful germs such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is no substantial evidence to support claims that raw milk can cure or alleviate [certain] conditions. Many of the studies cited are often misinterpreted or taken out of context.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pasteurizing milk involves heating it to 161 degrees for about 15 seconds, which kills off Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and other harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC which has long &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13422095/raw-milk-sales-bird-flu-immunity-myth.html"&gt;warned against drinking raw milk&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'Since the early 1900s, pasteurization has greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency has recorded &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/dangers-raw-milk-unpasteurized-milk-can-pose-serious-health-risk"&gt;more than 200 disease outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; linked to drinking raw milk from 1998 through 2018, which caused 2,645 illnesses, 228 hospitalizations and three deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Soy milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the crowded field of plant-based milks to choose from, soy milk comes out as the option with the highest nutrient density per eight ounce serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soybeans are a protein powerhouse packing six grams and at least 20 percent of your daily value of calcium and B12. It is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids that humans need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Caswell said: 'Soy milk fortified with calcium, vitamin A and vitamin D is an excellent alternative because it is nutritionally comparable to regular milk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soy milk has been clouded in controversy recently due to some of its ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://foodprint.org/real-food/soy-milk/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USDA%2C%20nearly,only%2017%20percent%20in%201997."&gt;Nearly 100 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all soy acreage planted on US land is genetically modified to resist herbicides and pesticides. That’s up from 17 percent in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some are concerned about the impact this has on their health, though there has not been any conclusive evidence pointing to harm or a decline in nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soy is generally heart-healthy and good for blood vessels. A 2020 study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041306"&gt;Circulation &lt;/a&gt;showed American men and women who ate the highest amounts of tofu and isoflavones from soy foods had an 18 percent and 13 percent lower risk, respectively, of developing heart disease compared with those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not look at soy milk specifically, though the results are noteworthy given that soy milk contains those same isoflavones.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another sticking point for soy is its association with a higher breast cancer risk. Isoflavones in soy are a type of plant estrogen known as phytoestrogen, which functions similarly to human estrogen, but with weaker effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tara Scott, an OB/GYN and hormone specialist, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hormoneguru/video/6984210455661137158?lang=en"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: '[With] soy milk, you do have to worry about the quality of the soy and the fact that it can be a phytoestrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because estrogen is known to play a role in the genesis of breast cancers, there has been a long stream of debate and research into the question of whether consuming phytoestrogens exacerbates that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But phytoestrogens don’t always mimic estrogen. Sometimes they block the action of the hormone, meaning drinking soy milk could, in theory, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/98/7/459/2522023"&gt;reduce the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2021, researchers in China found eating soy could stave off death due to breast cancer. They studied 1,460 early-stage breast cancer survivors’ intake of isoflavone in soy before and after their diagnosis over a four-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking or eating high amounts of soy was associated with a 66 percent lower risk of death from any cause and a 64 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher soy intake after the breast cancer diagnosis was associated with a 64 percent and 51 percent lower risk of death from any cause and breast cancer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Oat milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is now a wide selection of oat milk and other plant-based beverages on the market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oat milk is the milk of the moment, but it’s also the one most likely to cause a spike in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biochemist Jessie Inchauspé said in a viral interview on the drink: ‘Oat milk comes from oats, oats are a grain, and grains are starch. So, when you’re drinking oat milk, you’re drinking starch juice. You’re drinking juice with a lot of glucose in it – so it leads to a big glucose spike.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people without diabetes, the increase in blood glucose most likely is not worrisome enough to warrant skipping your oat milk latte, but it could be concerning for people with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oat milk is low in protein compared to dairy and soy milk, though higher in fiber and lower in fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutrition experts point out it’s worth paying close attention to the ingredients label, which should have only list a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Companies are also likely to add gums and flavors, which cut in to the already shaky nutritional foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many popular oat milks on the market &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ehn.org/glyphosate-free-oat-milk-2659999493.html"&gt;also contain glyphosate&lt;/a&gt;, which is the active ingredient in heavy duty weed killer RoundUp. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts believe late-season spraying of pesticides on crops in the field is to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Marinova, a professor of sustainability at the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, told Goop: 'Oat milk is really good in terms of its environmental footprint—very, very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Yet it’s grown as a monoculture, which makes it vulnerable to all kinds of bugs and pests. Therefore, we see increased use of pesticides, including glyphosate, which essentially have potentially toxic implications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Almond milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almond milk is the top-selling plant-based milk in the US, yet it has the weakest nutritional profile compared to the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-seven percent of it is water, and one eight-ounce serving of almond milk has just one gram of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reading the label on the back of the carton is always a good idea, as some brands of almond milk are higher in sugar than cow’s milk. They’re also often loaded up with thickeners and flavoring that, like oat milk, may undercut the benefit of drinking it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unsweetened varieties of almond milk are typically low carb, and many brands enrich theirs with vitamins, minerals, and added protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almond milk is also naturally rich in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant with links to reducing risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Rice milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice milk is lower in calories than dairy milk and is gluten-free, making it a safe bet for people with celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also cholesterol-free and has only one gram of fat per cup, which works well for people on diets specifically tailored for keeping the heart healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its low fat and calorie content also make it a good option for someone looking to lose a few pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical serving has fewer calories than a glass of cow’s milk but it still has more than a cup of soy milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major drawback, though, is the drink’s high glycemic index. One cup of rice milk contains 33 grams of carbohydrates, three to four times the amount in cow's milk or soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally high carb content means diabetics should steer clear.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Coconut milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coconut milk, not to be confused with coconut water, comes from the flesh of mature brown coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It supplies the body with more magnesium than traditional cow’s milk and packs about 40 percent of the daily recommended allowance of iron in a single cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, coconut milk contains about half the protein of a glass of cow’s milk and more than four times the calories, but no cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The coconut has a high glycemic index (GI), which means it’s likely to cause a spike in blood sugar after eating it and diabetics may need to find another plant-based milk alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s not all bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While GI is high, coconut milk has a low glycemic load, a measure that takes into account glycemic index and the portion eaten. A low glycemic load means it has very little impact on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPM0VWTWpkalpQS29lN1M5OXFFbzMtMi1rTnhJcV9CWjJta0NIRFc3Y0t5YkFVTU50MVE1WkNFVU5SZlJkZGNYcms0T3dXYlRscl8xendhcnB3bXBNa1FDSUlZZ3R6c1dVN1dhb3l1dzB6d21RVV9HZzctVWh1aEx3OXR0dzJteHFNVFpSMmJsSzFsdnZrVl9mWXRlM2FmWVhEQmZGNUVWQWg0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNeTZidFhLc3BOWlo1aE9HYlVoNWxIYjJINTRXczJPb3BjR3NaSTZ2OWNHYUQ3bEhuV3lsNHdnc3FMWGpIenVUOEJjdlN4NU5DVW9YTERfRmNaYkNtUVQzTFR2QS14MXF2eFF5cklnSlRCMVZOMFFIZnN0bEplUVF5Sjl6MlBGMUpweTNJRUQ3dXlzWkJIdFVrd242bmFnQkMzQ215YWpoWi1fY242Ry1V</guid></item><item><title>Dementia may not always be the threat it is now.

We also have data from other countries as well, that again, reassures us that vaccines are not associated with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there is already so much data on this topic, Marnik said it’s a waste of resources to even do this study. She said that those resources could be better used on investigating things we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it’s an ironic move from an administration that is so set on government efficiency and transparency. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just find it funny that an administration that’s so obsessed with government efficiency and saving money, so much so that they’re &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nih-cuts-science_n_67aa3b53e4b0ade4a9a36a1e" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cutting research grants" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67aa3b53e4b0ade4a9a36a1e" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;cutting research grants&lt;/a&gt;, is going to spend money relitigating something that we have already dozens upon dozens of peer-reviewed studies that have shown definitively that vaccines do not cause autism,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eric2687/?hl=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric Burnett" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/eric2687/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;Dr. Eric Burnett&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine doctor at an academic medical center in New York and a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.eric.b?lang=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="health communicator on social media" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.eric.b?lang=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;health communicator on social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a well-established point that is agreed upon by every major academic medical source, the World Health Organization and the medical academies, Burnett added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an ironic choice for another reason. Some of Geier’s research has been retracted because of a failure to disclose conflicts of interest, said Burnett, “which is also interesting because RFK Jr. said that he wants to increase transparency around vaccines, yet is going to employ someone who has been cited for not disclosing their conflicts of interest when they’ve written research studies before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Kayla Bartkowski via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kayla Bartkowski via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"It is clear that by putting an investigator in charge of this who has a terrible record of scientific research and dubious ethics that they have already decided the outcome of this study, however it is carried out," Tara Smith said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This research also stigmatizes the autistic community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t only a farce scientifically, but it once again brings about harm to the autism community,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy has long suggested that autism is a fate worse than death via his anti-vaccine advocacy. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2011/05/19/AFcSmR7G_story.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Geiers have physically harmed autistic patients" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2011/05/19/AFcSmR7G_story.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;The Geiers have physically harmed autistic patients&lt;/a&gt; under their care.

But it will have the stamp of approval from our highest scientific agencies, setting back work on both vaccines and autism and inviting more controversy where scientifically, we have seen for many years that none is present,” Smith added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Kennedy really wanted to have an honest evaluation on this aspect, he would have put reputable epidemiologists in charge,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett also stressed that this study is a waste of time because the link between autism and vaccines has already been disproven, but he hopes that with enough pushback from the medical community, the administration will move on from Geier and find someone unbiased to lead this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, experts say the ensuing report will be biased and lead to less trust in medicine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that in a few months time, or however long this analysis takes, the findings will say that vaccines are associated with autism — “because again, we can’t trust that [David Geier] would analyze the data in a way that is accurate, because it can be easy to skew things if you have a certain agenda that you want to push,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can manipulate any data set to get to the conclusion you want, and that’s the part that worries us and worries me,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/niniandthebrain/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Nini Munoz" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/niniandthebrain/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;Nini Munoz&lt;/a&gt;, a science communicator. While data scientists will be able to look at the report and find the flaws, the biased findings will further erode the public’s trust in the medical and scientific community, Munoz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And we are already seeing the consequences of dropping below necessary coverage levels with the measles vaccine, right? &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-grow_n_67e2e3a7e4b075349cd16d8f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="We have a huge outbreak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67e2e3a7e4b075349cd16d8f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;We have a huge outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. We might lose our elimination status. So it’s very concerning because that’s the goal — to erode trust in science and in the institutions,” Munoz said, “and that doesn’t bode well for anybody. Not for individuals, not for communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett added that it’s a shame that this study is happening at all. “Especially at a point where we need to be bolstering the public confidence in the healthcare system, stuff like this is not going to help. It’s just going to sow more doubts, more confusion,” Burnett noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone is unsure about vaccinating their child, the fact that this study is even happening could sow doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re going to say, ‘Well, I don’t know how safe it is, because the CDC, the federal government, is doing a study seeing if the vaccines cause autism,’” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when, once again, since there are already dozens of studies that show the safety of vaccines, this study is “a waste of time and a waste of money, and is going to have potential harm,” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is highly concerning, but there are a few things you can do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If biased findings do come out, “I think we have to really warn people that if this is what happens in the future, that they should then rely on all of the data that we have that shows that vaccines are not associated with autism,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t trust data from the U.S., you can look outside of the country to places like &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the Public Health Agency of Canada" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;the Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Health Service in England" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e42a1ae4b05205243a5c98" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhs.uk/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="19"&gt;National Health Service in England&lt;/a&gt;, which also have decades of research disproving the notion that vaccinations cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, when in doubt, you can also rely on some of those other official websites if we can’t rely on our own government ones,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond looking at credible research, you can take control of your own health by making sure you, your children and your loved ones are up to date on your vaccinations, Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

A new study reveals that two neuron types in the nucleus accumbens—D1 and D2 neurons—respond together to both rewarding and aversive stimuli, but in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using real-time imaging in mice, researchers found that D2 neurons are especially important for updating learned associations, such as recognizing when a threat is no longer dangerous. These insights could help explain why people with anxiety or PTSD struggle to let go of negative memories and may lead to targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D1 and D2 Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Both neuron types respond to rewards and threats but have different roles in learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D2’s Role in Extinction:&lt;/strong&gt; D2 neurons help extinguish negative associations when a stimulus is no longer aversive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding D2 function may inform new therapies for anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The human brain contains billions of neurons that continuously receive information and stimuli from the outside. To make decisions, neurons assess at every moment whether the stimulus is positive or negative. If it is positive, there is a tendency to approach, while if it is negative, an aversion reaction arises, which helps to ensure survival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the brain plays a central role in the process of evaluating and coding stimuli, but how the D1 and D2 neuronal populations of the NAc encode appetitive or aversive stimuli is still not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108250"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and a brain scan." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When associations change, such as when a negative stimulus no longer has an unpleasant consequence, the D2 neurons are essential for extinguishing that aversive association. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deepen knowledge in this area, a team of researchers coordinated by Ana João Rodrigues and Carina Soares-Cunha (ICVS, U.Minho), with the support of the BIAL Foundation, studied the D1 and D2 neurons of the NAc to understand how they distinguish between stimuli and influence learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking hundreds of neurons in mice exposed to appetitive and aversive stimuli in real-time, the researchers demonstrated for the first time that D1 and D2 responded together to both stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons, published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reveal that using advanced imaging in mice, they were able to observe that during associative learning, i.e. when a stimulus is associated with a reward or punishment, both types of neurons are activated and work together, but they do so differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When associations change, such as when a negative stimulus no longer has an unpleasant consequence, the D2 neurons are essential for extinguishing that aversive association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since difficulties in modifying negative associations are linked to anxiety and post-traumatic stress, better understanding the function of D2 neurons could help develop new treatments”, explains Carina Soares-Cunha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same external stimulus can provoke different reactions depending on the individual’s context and memories. For example, the sound of fireworks can evoke celebrations and joy. Still, for a former combatant, it can trigger an anxiety crisis, bringing back memories of war, even if he is in a safe environment”, she exemplifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the brain’s ability to constantly reclassify external stimuli based on previous experiences and adapt to new situations while simultaneously proving the complexity of the neuronal circuits involved in this type of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was developed in partnership with Rui Costa and Gabriela Martins from Columbia University and the Allen Institute (USA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to the BIAL Foundation, the research was co-funded by the European Research Council, the la Caixa Foundation, and the Foundation for Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2350424d4751420d534a4d574c63414a424f454c564d4742574a4c4d0d404c4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sandra Pinto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bialfoundation.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sandra Pinto – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55269-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Carina Soares-Cunha et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region for motivated behaviors, yet how distinct neuronal populations encode appetitive or aversive stimuli remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using microendoscopic calcium imaging in mice, we tracked NAc shell D1- or D2-medium spiny neurons’ (MSNs) activity during exposure to stimuli of opposing valence and associative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite drift in individual neurons’ coding, both D1- and D2-population activity was sufficient to discriminate opposing valence unconditioned stimuli, but not predictive cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, D1- and D2-MSNs were similarly co-recruited during appetitive and aversive conditioning, supporting a concurrent role in associative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when contingencies changed, there was an asymmetric response in the NAc, with more pronounced changes in the activity of D2-MSNs. Optogenetic manipulation of D2-MSNs provided causal evidence of the necessity of this population in the extinction of aversive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal how NAc shell neurons encode valence, Pavlovian associations and their extinction, and unveil mechanisms underlying motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:48:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE00VWtHTjFrWlVsV1k5RlA3ckF3Q0FNOFRsNnFBU1Z6SlZjRkp0T041YVpxR3B2TFh6MDR3X2FVZnhxQkl4TzFGc1dwSXJydnk2UmhJRmg4RDc3emlqbTVkVGZpalotMjJfY1dqUXgwYw</guid></item><item><title>How Often You Go to the Bathroom Could Reveal Hidden Health Risks, New Study Says - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNamRnTHpmZGc4SGw3X1hKQVBqeHJRVG1tNkFmVFJVd3JkSDA4dXp3LWo4Rk9tdWtOdzlzekZpVEpMcVZYQm9kRlR3TkJGT1JLcE5SaU5yLUM3MWlEdXIxMnNVZW5YUjBqeDk0NDJ0UkxpRmtJOG14YnIzeEcwTE9fU0xkRTVUZ19TbmVXRk5ISTViaUtjdDZBUEdVM0RyOFhNby1HRVZPSHAzbkpacjI1bVk0cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t give much thought to their bathroom schedule. But according to new research, &lt;strong&gt;how often you go&lt;/strong&gt; could be a strong indicator of your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study published in Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has revealed a striking &lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt; between bowel movement frequency and long-term physiological well-being. Researchers found that people who have one to two bowel movements per day tend to show healthier biological markers than those who go more or less often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Your Poop Schedule Is Telling You&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by &lt;em&gt;Sean Gibbons&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;Institute for Systems Biology&lt;/strong&gt;, analyzed data from over 1,400 healthy adults. These participants weren’t just surveyed — they provided stool and blood samples, underwent gut microbiome analysis, and filled out detailed lifestyle and diet questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They were then divided into four groups: those with &lt;strong&gt;constipation&lt;/strong&gt; (1–2 bowel movements per week), &lt;strong&gt;low-normal&lt;/strong&gt; (3–6 per week), &lt;strong&gt;high-normal&lt;/strong&gt; (1–3 per day), and &lt;strong&gt;diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt; (more than 3 per day).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what they discovered: people with constipation had &lt;strong&gt;higher levels of toxins&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;p-cresol sulfate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;indoxyl sulfate&lt;/em&gt; in their blood. These compounds are produced when gut bacteria shift from fermenting fiber to breaking down proteins — a process that can put significant strain on the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Problem with Both Extremes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, participants who experienced frequent diarrhea had clinical signs of inflammation and possible liver damage. According to the researchers, “the body excretes excessive bile acid” during diarrhea, which is usually recycled by the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That means the organ has to work harder to compensate, disrupting fat absorption and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/one-simple-change-key-preventing-dementia/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76113" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall metabolic function&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, people who fell into the “&lt;strong&gt;Goldilocks zone&lt;/strong&gt;” — with one or two bowel movements a day — had gut microbiomes rich in &lt;strong&gt;strict anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt;, a type of bacteria associated with good health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Diet Connection Is Crystal Clear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to know what lifestyle habits were most common among the healthiest group. The biggest indicator? Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “It was eating more fruit and vegetables, that was the biggest signal we saw,” Gibbons said. These individuals were also more likely to &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/09/why-its-urgent-to-stop-drinking-bottled-water/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12088" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drink water regularly&lt;/a&gt;, stay physically active, and lean toward plant-based meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the data also showed that &lt;strong&gt;younger people, women&lt;/strong&gt;, and those with &lt;strong&gt;lower body mass indexes&lt;/strong&gt; were more likely to have less frequent bowel movements. Hormonal and neurological differences, as well as lower food intake, may explain these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving Toward Prevention Through the Gut&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research are big. “I do hope that this work will kind of open clinicians’ minds a bit to the potential risks of not managing bowel movement frequencies,” Gibbons noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors have traditionally seen irregular bowel movements as more of a discomfort than a medical concern. But this study suggests they could be an overlooked factor in &lt;strong&gt;chronic disease prevention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The next step, according to the researchers, is to launch a &lt;strong&gt;long-term clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt; that tracks health outcomes based on managed bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Hidden Health Signal Hiding in Plain Sight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realize how much their gut routine could reflect deeper health dynamics. But this study makes one thing clear: bowel movement frequency isn’t just about comfort — it’s about &lt;strong&gt;systemic health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s toxic buildup from infrequent bowel movements or inflammatory strain from too many, your bathroom schedule could be one of the clearest windows into how your body’s functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As science continues to explore the gut-body connection, one thing is becoming evident: regularity isn’t just about rhythm — it’s about resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, recent research challenges this common assumption that regular workouts are the perfect antidote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study, which was recently published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724099200" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American College of Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that doing the recommended amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise during the week probably isn't enough to counteract all of the cardiovascular risks of being sedentary for prolonged periods. Of course, there’s only so much you can do if you happen to have a desk job, making this health conundrum tricky to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's what the study uncovered, plus what cardiologists recommend doing if you have to sit for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/cardiology/ca/santa-monica/rigved-tadwalkar-1679885883" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rigved Tadwalkar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rigved Tadwalkar&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a consultative cardiologist and medical director of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Christopher Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/ragavendra-baliga-mbbs-23370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ragavendra Baliga, MBBS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ragavendra Baliga, MBBS&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What The New Research Uncovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed one week of activity tracker data collected from more than 89,500 people who participated in the U.K. Biobank, a longitudinal health study to assess how many hours people sat during the day and how much moderate to vigorous physical activity they achieved, and followed up across a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers then broke down the data to look at the associations between how much time people spent sitting during the week, along with their future risk of developing atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat), heart attacks, heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered that people who were sedentary had a higher risk of developing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the cardiovascular issues just mentioned. But those who sat for more than 10.6 hours a day (not including when they were lying down asleep) had up to a 60 percent higher risk of developing heart failure or dying from a cardiovascular cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The research also determined that the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and heart attacks mostly was mitigated if the excessive sitters got the recommended 150 minutes (or more) moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. But meeting the exercise requirement only partially offset the risk of heart failure and dying from a cardiovascular cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, squeezing more standing time and movement into your day &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; your exercise window to break up prolonged periods of sitting seems to be vital. “Optimizing sedentary behavior appears to be important even among physically active individuals,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Sitting Is So Harmful To Your Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is hardly the first study to link sitting for hours and hours a day to serious health issues. Spending long periods of time sitting has been linked to a higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254622001016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816825" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/6/1254/138715/Frequency-of-Interruptions-to-Sitting-Time" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7060463/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain types of cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;certain types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, in a number of studies.

Sitting for longer periods of time may also raise the risk of bodily inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a slew of serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And, yes, even super active individuals are in the danger zone. “Even those who exercise can be at risk if they are sedentary for most of the day,” Dr. Tadwalkar adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Tweak Your Daily Routine To Mitigate The Effects Of Sitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Simply put: Watch the clock and sit for as little time per day as you can. "Limiting sedentary time to under 10.6 hours per day may be a practical baseline for improving heart health," says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/ragavendra-baliga-mbbs-23370__;!!Ivohdkk!m_tEAF4PRknsvE-wiMvToetbv07dQ5x-_WwgO2dpKg6_XHqX-1zYFcyPMxXgsO_I6VLPY3nWNQFsqK8vl6AYSeG0ihXzfg$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ragavendra Baliga;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ragavendra Baliga&lt;/a&gt;, MBBS, a cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But you’re not screwed if you have a desk job. Doctors say it’s important to be aware of how much you’re moving throughout the day. If there's room for improvement, they always recommend being more active when and where you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Getting active is one of the most important things people with heart disease or at risk of heart disease—which is everyone—can do to improve their heart health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Christopher Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He recommends having a regular exercise plan in place, and doing whatever you can to fit in at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity a week. If you’re not already working out consistently, Dr. Berg suggests committing to a smaller goal and working your way up. (Head here for sound advice on setting realistic and attainable workout goals.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To supplement your regular workout routine, it's also essential to do what you can to squeeze in more micro movement pockets through your day, says Dr. Berg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Some of his simple-yet-effective suggestions:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Take the stairs whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Take a lap around your office or home when you find a moment during your workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Take the long way to and from the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Park farther away from store entrances to get in more steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Stand up and walk around when you need to be on a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sneak little exercises into your day, like doing squats or jumping jacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Find small pockets of time to stand as much as possible before and after work, like having breakfast and dinner at a tall countertop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consider getting a fitness tracker to keep tabs on your step count and offer alerts and nudges to remind you to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These are all small, easy actions that one can do to improve health,” Dr. Berg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Of course, if you have a family history of heart disease or are especially worried about your risk, it's a good idea to check in with a medical professional. They can give you an evaluation and suggest personalized next steps from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQYkhmR0V6Q2F5ZWVreXZ2VHk0cHlNaWFScG1HRnRleHpoNXJfTlNZb3g2U1ppcW53YXlfVlhoUzJTcGhpUDQ0VFVYMTlycDBibnpvNEpHZGsyN2FNNHhqM0RUN0xVc2JaSWFFb1ZfcEsxaXRsb3lHZ3I1UUJCa05FcHNWdUI</guid></item><item><title>Natural dietary supplement proven effective against Alzheimer’s disease - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOMHU0d2FpN2FEV1FvSENYUjdwUWdIelpFUE9pLWNlajhKa3l2bjkwRlZBRm02eWozUGpNV01TV3VMc0V5TnhaQ1JobThwVzNaanZDcFliQTNSWWgyZ0hYbnBULVBncUFzTFFpaGM3NU5hOFlVSFlaNzVIRFZLWXZzR3Z5OF9nV3BjaXFGQm16Sjljem8tY2pfX1pNVDZJcVZ5dy1iSDF2SDBoVTZHX3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery hints that NR, which is a form of vitamin B3, might affect key brain processes involved in illnesses like Alzheimer’s. Backed by federal funding, the findings appeared in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13754#.Y5nVITl-nME.twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt; and are already sparking fresh interest in the field of brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR acts as a building block for a molecule known as NAD+, which plays a critical role in fixing damaged cells and DNA. As people grow older—or face long-term illnesses—NAD+ levels fall. That drop is tied to health problems like obesity and damage caused by smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Martens, now a professor at the University of Delaware, started exploring NR during his postdoc work at &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt;. His early studies showed that NR raised NAD+ levels in the blood. But he wasn’t sure if it could reach the brain, where it might help the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Christopher Martens, director of the Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research is leading a study into whether nicotinamide riboside (NR) improves memory and brain blood flow in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. (CREDIT: University of Delaware) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard brain scans, like MRIs, can’t directly measure NAD+ and are costly and hard to use in large studies. To get around this, the team used an inventive method: testing extracellular vesicles (EVs). These are tiny particles released by brain cells that float through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVs offer a unique window into brain activity. By measuring NAD+ in these particles, researchers gained a more direct view of what was happening inside the brain. This technique could become a simpler way to track &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/belly-fat-can-impact-brain-health-and-increase-risk-for-alzheimer-s-study-finds/"&gt;brain changes over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a six-week clinical trial, NAD+ levels in these EVs rose after daily NR use. At the same time, shifts were seen in proteins tied to Alzheimer's, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-drugs-show-promise-against-alzheimer-s-parkinson-s-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; and tau. These proteins often build up in brains affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens pointed out that this link between NAD+ and brain proteins suggests NR might affect more than one brain process. That possibility makes it a promising tool for slowing—or perhaps one day preventing—brain decline linked to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens is currently leading a 12-week study investigating NR's effects on older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Supported by the &lt;a href="https://sites.udel.edu/memory-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research&lt;/a&gt; and the NIA, this study aims to determine whether NR supplementation yields greater benefits in individuals with cognitive deficits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited effectiveness of current &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/can-health-and-lifestyle-changes-protect-the-elderly-from-alzheimer-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s medications&lt;/a&gt; in halting disease progression, Martens hopes that NR supplementation may preserve cognitive function and quality of life in affected individuals. The ongoing trial also seeks to elucidate NR's underlying mechanisms and its potential to slow neurodegenerative disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Martens and Kapogiannis plan to explore NR's effects on cognition and its potential as a therapeutic intervention for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/coffee-grounds-hold-the-key-to-preventing-alzheimer-s-parkinson-s-and-huntington-s-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

NAD+ is involved in DNA repair and the activation of sirtuins, proteins that regulate cellular health and longevity. As a result, NR supplementation may help reduce the visible signs of aging and improve overall vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR may support metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting healthy lipid metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;A genetically modified &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;porcine liver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been successfully transplanted into a&lt;strong&gt; human subject&lt;/strong&gt;, constituting a historic precedent in the field of organ transplantation. The liver demonstrated functional viability for a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;period of 10 days within the body of a brain-dead patient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, without eliciting signs of immune rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Procedure Designed as Proof of Concept&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experimental procedure was conducted by a multidisciplinary medical team from the &lt;em&gt;Fourth Military Medical University&lt;/em&gt; in China, under the supervision of &lt;em&gt;Kai-Shan Tao&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zhao-Xu Yang&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Xuan Zhang&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Hong-Tao Zhang&lt;/em&gt;. The intervention was executed in a &lt;em&gt;brain-dead human subject&lt;/em&gt;, whose native liver was preserved in situ. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;porcine liver&lt;/em&gt; was not intended as a full replacement but was instead positioned within the abdominal cavity as an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2020657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;auxiliary graft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, connected to the patient’s circulatory system to enable physiological monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This auxiliary design was selected to facilitate close observation of the graft’s integration without compromising the host’s native hepatic functions. The primary objective was to evaluate the porcine liver’s metabolic activity and immunological compatibility under clinical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Six Genetic Modifications Mitigate Immune Rejection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The transplanted liver was sourced from a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;genetically engineered pig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, developed with six targeted genetic modifications. These included the removal of endogenous genes responsible for &lt;em&gt;hyperacute rejection&lt;/em&gt;—a rapid and destructive immune response—and the insertion of specific &lt;em&gt;human genes&lt;/em&gt; designed to enhance histocompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These modifications were strategically implemented to suppress &lt;strong&gt;xenoantigen&lt;/strong&gt; expression and promote tolerogenic interaction with the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/mysterious-new-life-forms-human-body/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73894" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The immunosuppressive regimen applied during the study further inhibited T-cell and B-cell activation, mechanisms primarily responsible for organ rejection in xenogeneic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Porcine Liver Demonstrated Essential Functional Outputs&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 10-day observation window, the porcine liver exhibited &lt;strong&gt;sustained functional activity&lt;/strong&gt;. Key hepatic functions were confirmed via the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secretion of bile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;and synthesis of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;porcine albumin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, both serving as fundamental indicators of baseline hepatic performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The surgical team also reported stable hemodynamic parameters and adequate &lt;em&gt;hepatic perfusion velocity&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting the graft maintained sufficient vascular integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study concluded on the tenth day at the request of the patient’s family, not due to medical complications. By that time, the graft remained fully functional and free from observable immune-mediated damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Bile Secreted By The Transplanted Liver" class="wp-image-84213" data-lazy-srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver.jpeg 642w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver-380x156.jpeg 380w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver-520x214.jpeg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" data-lazy-src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver.jpeg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver.jpeg" alt="Bile Secreted By The Transplanted Liver" class="wp-image-84213" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver.jpeg 642w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver-380x156.jpeg 380w, https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bile-secreted-by-the-transplanted-liver-520x214.jpeg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bile secreted by the transplanted liver. (Tao et al., &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because the host’s native liver remained functional during the study, the clinical team acknowledges that it is not yet possible to determine whether the porcine graft alone could support an individual experiencing hepatic failure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the absence of immune rejection and the presence of stable metabolic function propose a viable &lt;em&gt;intermediate solution&lt;/em&gt; for patients awaiting human liver transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Broader Implications for Xenotransplantation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This initiative builds upon prior advances in the domain of &lt;strong&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2023, a modified pig liver was externally connected to a human subject for&lt;strong&gt; 72 hours&lt;/strong&gt;. Likewise, genetically modified &lt;em&gt;porcine kidneys&lt;/em&gt; have previously been transplanted into brain-dead patients with promising outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, because hepatic function encompasses more complex regulatory and metabolic pathways compared to renal activity, successful liver xenotransplantation was previously considered a more formidable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that with precise genetic engineering and immunosuppressive strategies, even the sophisticated functional profile of the liver can be preserved in a xenogeneic context.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

(Tao et al., &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expert Assessment and Future Research Directions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Independent experts have acknowledged the significance of the findings. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rafael Matesanz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, nephrologist at the &lt;em&gt;National Transplant Organization&lt;/em&gt; in Spain, stated that the experiment “&lt;strong&gt;opens up a different path&lt;/strong&gt;” toward the temporary replacement of diseased livers using xenogeneic organs until human grafts become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Similarly,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Iván Fernández Vega&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, neuropathologist at the &lt;em&gt;University of Oviedo&lt;/em&gt;, commended the methodological rigor of the study, highlighting the “exhaustive clinical, immunological, histological and hemodynamic characterization” as setting a new standard in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these advances, the study’s scope was limited to a single subject and a narrow subset of liver functions—primarily &lt;em&gt;bile production&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;albumin synthesis&lt;/em&gt;. Comprehensive functional assessments and larger sample sizes will be necessary to evaluate full therapeutic applicability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward Clinical Integration of Xenogeneic Organs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research, now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, represents a foundational advancement in the integration of genetically modified animal organs into human clinical frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that porcine organs, appropriately modified, could be deployed as temporary or even transitional support mechanisms for critically ill patients awaiting human donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While further investigation is required to establish long-term safety, scalability, and ethical governance, this study affirms the plausibility of &lt;strong&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt; as a meaningful extension of contemporary transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
