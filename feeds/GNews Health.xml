In December, a panel appointed by Kennedy voted to remove a longstanding recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that all newborns be vaccinated against hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;updated its website in November&lt;/a&gt; at the instruction of Kennedy to claim that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism”, which top public health experts have decried as false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The agency’s move toward misinformation and away from public health leadership makes it more difficult to combat distrust in vaccinations in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, says Bowdish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, Canada’s health minister, Marjorie Michel, warned that US health and science institutions can no longer be depended upon for accurate information. In an interview with the Canadian Press, she said: “I cannot trust them as a reliable partner, no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michel also told CBC News that “some” Canadians could be influenced by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The minister’s comments come at the conclusion of a disastrous year for measles in Canada, as the country was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/canada-loses-measles-free-elimination-status" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stripped of its measles elimination status in November&lt;/a&gt; after more than 5,000 cases were reported across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e3fd6897-0f0b-4633-a86b-22dbcabd5e6c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere","elementId":"e3fd6897-0f0b-4633-a86b-22dbcabd5e6c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/measles-outbreak-ontario-canada"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Physicians pointed to drops in childhood vaccination rates, limited access to family doctors and surging misinformation in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/measles-outbreak-ontario-canada" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;just some of the factors&lt;/a&gt; fuelling the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meta’s ban on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/canada-meta-news-ban-facebook-fake" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the sharing of news&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, due to an ongoing dispute over legislation between the tech company and the government, also impedes reliable public health messaging, said Bowdish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2021, Canada published the results from a national survey on childhood immunisation and found 2.1% of two-year-olds had not received any vaccinations, an increase from 1.7% in 2019. Parents cited safety concerns or beliefs that vaccines did not work as their reasons for refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bowdish said in 2021 that these reasons often were connected to not having a family doctor and were related to access rather than skepticism. But in the last four years she suspects misinformation has surged, and new data is not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A December &lt;a href="https://documents.leger360.com/hubfs/Vaccines%20Hesitancy%20Dec.%202025/LegerHealthcare_VaccineHesitancy_2025%20Final.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;poll on vaccination hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; by research firm Leger Healthcare found that while most Canadians (74%) have confidence in vaccines, hesitancy has increased primarily due to fears around safety driven by social media and government mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The survey also found that 17% of those who expressed a lack of confidence in vaccines say they get their information from US government websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":15,"listId":6042,"identityName":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","description":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration","name":"This Week in Trumpland","frequency":"At least once a week","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"news","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kumanan Wilson, a doctor and professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa, said Canada can combat concerns about changes at the CDC by cooperating with other public health systems worldwide and taking the helm on developing health surveillance while US institutions languish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If we build this system, it’s not only going to be great for Canada. We can provide really valuable information to the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Michel Grignon, a professor and health economist at McMaster University, warned that increased mistrust in vaccinations in Canada is the country’s own doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said the federal government instead needs to look at the homegrown causes of vaccine distrust, rather than focusing too much on the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As Canada’s social safety nets have eroded over many decades, the pandemic was a further catalyst that disrupted social cohesion, pushing people to the margins of society and sowing distrust in government, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Grignon pointed to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/ottawa-declares-state-of-emergency-as-canada-trucker-protest-paralyses-city" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2022 trucker protests&lt;/a&gt; against Covid restrictions as a manifestation of the collapse of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are the source of our own problem, and our vaccine hesitancy has not much to do with the US. It has to do with us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPdVlieC1GR1dHdUowTVJiMjdNZWdtRHFxUURDTkpEQllGQVJ2YVVNWTE3LU5ITTBnOWFnMUZyRFo1WC0xOXRoblh2aTFIVlphOENaeVUybUE0bWhZbHBGMEp4Y0RDTFBFVzZPbUNFQUx5MHppWDlLbXVoQV9kOEpZRnB0YjlMNEs3MXZVN2VGZ3A</guid></item><item><title>严重的事情正在发生在脱离GLP-1s的人身上-未来主义</title><link>https://futurism.com/health-medicine/glp1-weight-gain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="article-featured-image-figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Many people who successfully lost weight on Ozempic and other &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 agonist drugs&lt;/a&gt; are having trouble weaning themselves off the injectables, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn98pdpyjz5o" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; because the hunger for food comes roaring back with a vengeance — and hence the pounds start creeping up again, hinting that patients are likely to develop life-long dependencies on the substances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“For the first 38 years of my life, I was overweight — now I’m six stone (38kg) [83 pounds] lighter,” Tanya Hall, a Wegovy user who can’t get off the drug, told the news organization. “Therefore, there’s part of me that feels like there’s an addiction to keep it going because it makes me feel the way that I feel, it makes me feel in control.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This is borne out by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-says-stopping-obesity-drug-may-cause-full-weight-regain-5-years-2023-03-30/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that found patients who stop using these medications often gain much of their weight back. That’s why you have celebrities like Oprah, who &lt;a href="https://people.com/oprah-reveals-she-stopped-using-glp1s-for-12-months-and-shares-exactly-what-happened-exclusive-11877163" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;People Magazine&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt; that she plans to stay on it indefinitely. The implication: many users will have to treat their obesity as a chronic condition and will need to stay on these drugs for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s going to be a lifetime thing,” Oprah said. “I’m on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I’ve proven to myself I need it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;For patients who do get off the drugs, they tend to gain two thirds of their lost weight back, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-says-stopping-obesity-drug-may-cause-full-weight-regain-5-years-2023-03-30/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk. Physician Hussain Al-Zubaidi told the &lt;em&gt;BBC &lt;/em&gt;that he’s seen patients gain 60 to 80 percent back of the weight they lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It might seem hopeless task, but all is not lost, according to Al-Zubaidi. He said patients should have an “exit strategy” in which they have made healthier lifestyle changes while on the injectables; the lifestyle changes can sustain the weight loss once they are completely off the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That’s what happened to Ellen Ogley, who told the &lt;em&gt;BBC &lt;/em&gt;that she lost 48.5 pounds while on Eli Lily’s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro. While on the medication, she established healthier eating habits and incorporated excerise into her routine. Even off the drugs for some time, she’s been able to maintain her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I want people to know that life after Mounjaro can be sustainable as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

His grandchild was complaining, ‘Dadaji, mujhe bohot thand lag rahi hai’ (Grandfather, I’m feeling very cold).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Rujuta, the grandfather’s response carried a deeper meaning. “The grandfather told him, ‘Tum thand ko pakdo’ (Catch the cold),” she said. “So the child stood with his chest open, and the cold went away.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing from the story, Rujuta emphasised that resilience and attitude matter just as much as diet. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;“I think in North India, there is very good jugaad for everything (a smart, practical solution for everything),” she said, adding, “You don’t just need food, you also need the attitude.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Once infected, about half of patients may die, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/flu-state-where-seasons-highly-contagious-variant-spreading-most" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flu By State: Where This Season’s Highly Contagious Variant Is Spreading The Most;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu By State: Where This Season’s Highly Contagious Variant Is Spreading The Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other fungi, C. auris can survive on human skin and cling to hospital surfaces and medical equipment, allowing it to spread easily in healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is resistant to multiple antifungal drugs, and it tends to spread in hospital settings, including on equipment being used on immunocompromised and semi-immunocompromised patients, such as ventilators and catheters," Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dangerous-fungus-spreading-us-hospitals-rapidly-increased" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previously told Fox News Digital.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previously told Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Scientists say the unique cell wall structure of C. auris makes it harder to kill.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also frequently misdiagnosed, delaying treatment and infection control measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, symptoms such as fever, chills and aches may be ubiquitous, and it can be mistaken for other infections," Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, he said intense research was ongoing to develop new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only four major classes of antifungal drugs are currently available, and C. auris has already shown resistance to many of them. While three new antifungal drugs have been approved or are in late-stage trials, researchers warn that drug development has struggled to keep pace with the fungus’s evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Lifestyle Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here For More Lifestyle Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the sobering findings, there is still room for cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The fungus can cling to skin and hospital surfaces, aiding its spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:separate research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;separate research&lt;/a&gt; published in December, scientists at the University of Exeter in England discovered a potential weakness in C. auris while studying the fungus in a living-host model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that, during infection, the fungus activates specific genes to scavenge iron, a nutrient it needs to survive, according to their paper, published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Download The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Download The Fox News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because iron is essential for the pathogen, researchers believe drugs that block this process could eventually stop infections or even allow existing medications to be repurposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think our research may have revealed an Achilles’ heel in this lethal pathogen during active infection," Dr. Hugh Gifford, a clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter and co-author of the study, said &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223043934.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in a statement.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in a statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;New research is underway to develop better treatments and diagnostics for C. auris.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers race to better understand the fungus, officials warn that strict infection control, rapid detection and continued investment in new treatments remain critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts emphasize that C. auris is not a threat to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy people.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy people.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to the CDI researchers and additional experts for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Angelica Stabile contributed reporting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Losing weight is challenging, and many people turn to weight-loss supplements to help achieve their goals. Unfortunately, many supplements marketed for weight loss don’t do what they promise—and may even work against your goals. Not only are supplements expensive, but they are also unregulated, so you don’t always know what you’re getting. The best way to lose weight is to focus on a food-first approach, which means eating plenty of nutrient-dense foods and maintaining a slight &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7922773/best-way-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off-according-to-experts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calorie deficit&lt;/a&gt; over time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we get into some popular weight-loss supplements and why nutrition professionals don't recommend them, plus helpful tips for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, sustainable weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-green-coffee-bean-extract"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Green Coffee Bean Extract &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve searched for supplements aiding weight loss, you’ve likely come across green coffee bean extract. Quite simply, this supplement is derived from the coffee plant’s seeds, which are green before roasting. “[Green coffee bean extract] has chlorogenic acid, a coffee compound that can supposedly decrease fat absorption and speed up metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://foodsense.net/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle VenHuizen, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She adds that these claims are mostly unwarranted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Only a few human trials have examined the effectiveness of green coffee bean extract on weight loss. These trials had poor study design and showed mixed results.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While one study found that green coffee extract may help reduce weight and body mass index, there wasn’t a significant effect on body fat percentage, meaning that the mass lost could come from water or muscle.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Body mass index (BMI) is a flawed measure that’s often used in healthcare to determine a person’s body weight category, and therefore, chronic disease risk. However, it has limitations and does not account for individual factors that influence one’s health status, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, sex and age. This is why it shouldn’t be used as a comprehensive measure of someone’s health and can be a source of body size stigma and bias.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Additionally, in my clinical experience, I have yet to meet a client who has lost weight by using green coffee bean extract,” says VenHuizen. Lastly, there isn’t much information on the safety of green coffee bean extract, so buyers beware. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-garcinia-cambogia"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Garcinia Cambogia &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Garcinia cambogia is a fruit with ​​hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a compound thought to reduce fat production in the body and suppress appetite. “Studies seem to indicate that some of these claims might be true, but unfortunately, the benefits are modest, and the research is conflicting,” says VenHuizen. One study&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;states that there are only a small number of studies on Garcinia cambogia, and the methodology is poor, meaning that these results shouldn’t be trusted.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even more alarming, “several studies have reported liver issues with long-term use of this supplement,” says VenHuizen.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is another pretty convincing reason to avoid adding this supplement to your weight-loss regimen. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Raspberry ketone is a compound found in the raspberry fruit. Small test-tube and animal studies suggest it may suppress the buildup of fat in the body, but the results are extremely limited. There has only been one human study on the effects of raspberry ketone on weight loss.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The participants took the supplement for eight weeks while also following a calorie-restricted diet. The raspberry ketone supplement was combined with caffeine, bitter orange, ginger, garlic, cayenne, L-theanine, pepper extract, B vitamins and chromium. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 45 participants who finished the study lost weight, but it’s impossible to know if it was due to the raspberry ketone blend or the calorie deficit. In short, there isn’t enough evidence to support raspberry ketone for weight loss, so save your money. Instead, we recommend snacking on some raspberries, which have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;several health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, including filling fiber and inflammation-fighting anthocyanins.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The most recognizable supplement on this list, caffeine is a compound that stimulates the nervous system. It’s naturally present in tea, coffee and chocolate, as well as in herbal supplements like guarana. Caffeine increases thermogenesis, the body’s natural production of heat. During this process, the body burns extra calories. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests caffeine can help with weight loss, but a large dose is necessary to create a response. One study concluded that more than 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight is necessary to stimulate the breakdown of fat.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a 150-pound person, that’s 200 mg of caffeine, or two cups of coffee. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is recommended to cap caffeine consumption 400 mg daily for safety, but everyone has a different tolerance level.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;People sensitive to caffeine may experience symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like nervousness, jitters, heart racing and headaches, among others. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although caffeine may increase fat loss, it’s not the best way to lose weight, especially because supplements with caffeine may contain more than that, plus other stimulants. That said, caffeine from natural sources like coffee is the safest way to consume caffeine. So, feel free to include a cup of coffee or tea in your day for an energy boost, but don’t expect it to affect your weight too much.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although they may not be quick or flashy, the most effective tools for losing weight are good old-fashioned healthy eating and exercise. VenHuizen recommends increasing &lt;a class="pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068570/best-high-fiber-fruits-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich fruits&lt;/a&gt; and vegetables and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-healthy-fats-for-weight-loss-8417296" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; in the diet. “These foods naturally increase satiety and provide anti-inflammatory benefits that may aid in weight loss,” says VenHuizen. “And unlike supplements, studies on fruit and vegetable intake show that these foods improve weight-loss efforts,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, “Trying to stay moderately active throughout the day, especially for people who work sedentary desk jobs, can help with weight loss,” says &lt;a href="https://dietitianmadeleine.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Madeleine Putzi, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She recommends getting up and walking around once per hour to increase your total amount of steps for the day, which is an easy and non-taxing way to increase your daily calorie burn. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Putzi also suggests investing in a standing desk and/or a walking pad if possible. “If you walk for 10 minutes at 3 miles per hour, you will hit around 1,000 steps. Do that every hour, and that's an easy 8,000 steps by the end of your workday,” says Putzi.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight-loss supplements are usually not worth the expensive price tag. If a supplement promises to “magically burn fat or flatten your belly,” chances are it’s not the miracle that’s promised on the bottle. A food and exercise approach to weight loss is the most effective way to reach your weight-loss goals in a sustainable way.&lt;br&gt;

Microplastics have been found not just in water, soil, and air, but also in Earth's least-traversed places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have identified microplastics in human reproductive tissues, but they've also been found throughout the human body, including our brain tissue, organs, and blood. Due to their pervasiveness, microplastics are impossible to avoid entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Studies linking microplastics to adverse outcomes are worryingly numerous, with new findings emerging routinely, indicating an ever-escalating environmental and health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research tends to focus on direct, immediate effects, but this study highlighted the potential for microplastics to harm future generations without direct exposure.

G. Wilson&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.montana.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Montana State University&lt;/a&gt;. Research in this area has looked at how bacteria in the digestive system respond when aronia berries are introduced, particularly in situations where unhealthy eating patterns could raise inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early investigations point to intriguing changes in microbes, and hinting that this berry might shift certain bacterial communities and reduce the strain triggered by high-fat diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-science-behind-aronia-berries"&gt;Science behind aronia berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used a mouse model with transplanted human gut microbiomes that came from donors with different inflammation levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aronia supplementation provided robust protection,” noted Dr. Wilson when reviewing the results at the end of the study. Scientists saw increases in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-have-very-clever-ways-of-supporting-human-health/"&gt;Eggerthellaceae&lt;/a&gt;, a family of bacteria that can process polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some data also linked &lt;a href="https://extension.umn.edu/trees-and-shrubs/black-chokeberry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;black chokeberry&lt;/a&gt; intake with changes in metabolites related to improved gut barriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts suggest that eating or drinking aronia-based products might assist in keeping the digestive system more balanced during periods of dietary stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personalizing-nutrition"&gt;Personalizing nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation can arise when people eat high-fat or sugary foods for long stretches. Researchers point out that a person’s unique microbiome might determine how well they adapt to certain dietary habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aronia’s &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/22/7823"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; may vary from one person to another, depending on individual gut ecology and background health status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who carry a set of gut bacteria already geared toward lower inflammation, the advantages from adding aronia might be more visible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept underscores how science is moving toward personalized nutrition, where different bodies respond to the same foods in slightly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-aronia-berries-help"&gt;How aronia berries help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other published works indicate that aronia is not just a source of antioxidants; it may also be linked with healthier glucose levels and heart function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of anthocyanins and other phenolic substances could explain how this fruit influences complex pathways connected to metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional uses of aronia include juices, jams, and powders, but emerging science is urging a closer look at its larger dietary potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some folks already consume aronia to freshen up their breakfast or snack routines, others remain unaware of its possible contributions to gut stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unraveling-unexpected-twists"&gt;Unraveling unexpected twists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some findings highlight the importance of gut diversity when it comes to inflammation. Researchers observed that mice with microbiomes from donors who had lower inflammation were more resilient during the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-fat-diets-cause-high-anxiety-through-changes-in-gut-bacteria/"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aronia seemed to shield this group even further. This suggests that, while aronia might help most individuals, those who have specific microbial imbalances might notice the biggest improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a broader level, it points to how small dietary changes, like adding a berry drink, can create ripple effects that protect overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-applications-on-the-horizon"&gt;Applications on the horizon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aronia’s tart flavor might not suit everyone right away. In grocery stores, it often appears in juice blends, concentrates, or dried forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s easy to mix with other fruits, people can add it to smoothies or desserts without changing their routines too drastically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research continues to evaluate how much aronia consumption is ideal for humans, since the dose can vary widely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some clinical trials, individuals experienced potential &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tackling-fat-with-food-tropical-plant-in-china-has-anti-obesity-properties/"&gt;anti-obesity benefits&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to improvements in the body’s natural defenses. These early observations pave the way for deeper investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aronia may carry special ingredients that bolster the gut’s ability to cope with stress, especially during nutritional challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators are looking to see if these insights might lead to new strategies for lowering inflammation in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This berry isn’t a magic bullet, and results will differ from person to person. Its potential, though, goes beyond just delivering antioxidants: it may connect with gut microbes in ways that support healthy balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh interest in aronia keeps growing, and the findings so far hint at a fruitful path for future study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1244692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPclV4SkduQ0N6X0hYRXlOaHJ2VHRVMnFEYlBMbDFtRDJWaU9uY0wzeTFPZ1doWURndVlXTVJ2YXZtc09yVDJlWjhGVHJiTndlVkpnWWdya0RUdGtpbVZlZDcyTlhJbnZfeERXUEdOOW5RZElTREFuTkRpZHFCTkdvbGJFZWVPMjdmRTdjdzBsQXFjeXZPVFhPYWxmQURodw</guid></item><item><title>这种季节性35卡路里水果可以提高你的免疫力，改善你的皮肤—并帮助你的大脑健康-纽约邮报</title><link>https://nypost.com/2026/01/03/health/this-35-calorie-fruit-can-boost-your-immunity-skin-and-brain-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a budget-friendly fruit in season right now that’s bursting with nutrients, low in calories and might just be the secret weapon your immune system and skin need this winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An added bonus: Your brain will also get a boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;By providing antioxidants and vitamin C, these fruits can brighten skin tone, improve texture and reduce wrinkles.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clementines, better known by their brand names Cuties or Halos, are like the smaller, sweeter cousins of the orange. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tiny citrus fruits are easy to peel, usually seedless and hit peak season from October through January.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t let their small size fool you: &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168195/nutrients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;One clementine&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at just 35 calories but delivers 36.1 mg of vitamin C — nearly 40% of what you need daily for optimal health. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is essential nutrient, meaning your body can’t make it on its own so you need to get it from your diet. It’s a powerhouse for your immune system, helping to destroy infectious microbes while keeping your tissues safe from damage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that getting enough vitamin C on a regular basis can help reduce the severity and duration of cold and flu symptoms. However, there is little evidence that popping vitamin C once you are already sick will speed recovery, so consistency matters when it comes to eating clementines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In the US, most clementines are grown in California and Florida.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Markus Mainka – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perks don’t stop at immunity. Vitamin C is also crucial for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/health/boost-collagen-in-your-skin-with-this-small-fruit-twice-a-day/"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, the protein that keeps your skin firm, plump and smooth. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Maintaining adequate collagen levels can reduce fine lines, prevent sagging and even speed up wound healing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clementines are also packed with other antioxidants, like flavonoids, which can fight inflammation, calm redness and soothe skin conditions like acne or rosacea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And with their high water content, these juicy snacks can help the skin stay hydrated, preventing dryness and flakiness.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the goodness doesn’t end there. Clementines contain folate and thiamine, two B vitamins that are crucial for your body, supporting everything from cell development to a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while a single clementine only has about 1 gram of fiber, snacking on a few throughout the day is an easy way to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/30/health/what-is-fibermaxxing-dietitian-warns-about-viral-trend/"&gt;boost your intake&lt;/a&gt;, supporting digestion, gut health and weight management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like other citrus fruits, clementines are brain-friendly, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Clementines are nutrient-dense, helping promote brain function and healthy aging.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WavebreakMediaMicro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They contain bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that help protect the brain from damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Studies on animals have shown that supplementing the diet with citruis fruits improves deficits in learning and memory, particularly spacial memory, which helps us remember where we’ve put things and recognition memory, which is vital for facial and name recall,” Dr. David Vauzour, a senior research fellow at Norwich Medical School, &lt;a href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/03/03/The-role-of-citrus-in-brain-health-Citrus-bioactive-compounds-improve-general-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told FoodNavigator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Clementines are also a rich source of hesperidin, a bioflavonoid with antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation, improve blood flow in the brain and support overall brain cell health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40694049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that getting hesperidin in your diet can help improve cognitive functions such as attention, learning and memory, as well as psychomotor skills like movement and coordination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40694049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that eating citrus fruits like clementines daily could cut the risk of developing dementia in older adults by nearly 15%.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They might even help your mood. Last year, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/health/eating-this-fruit-daily-can-lower-depression-risk-by-20-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scientists found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate a daily serving of citrus had about a 20% lower risk of being diagnosed with depression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The effect seems to be specific to citrus,” Raaj Mehta, the lead study author, told &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/02/eating-citrus-may-lower-depression-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;. “When we look at people’s total fruit or vegetable consumption, or at other individual fruits such as apples or bananas, we don’t see any relationship between intake and risk of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But before you grab a bag and start peeling, there’s something to keep in mind about clementines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some research has shown that clementines contain furanocoumarins, a compound also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3589309/"&gt;found in grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; that can interfere with certain medications, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27890698/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cholesterol-lowering statins&lt;/a&gt;, and potentially cause complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be safe, experts recommend checking with your doctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions before adding large amounts of citrus fruit to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roasted Potato Tzatziki Bowls deliver comfort and flavor while packing 10g of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant-based yet protein-rich, each bowl offers 17g of protein thanks to chickpeas and Greek-style yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy and satisfying, this 45-minute meal proves high-fiber dinners can be cozy and delicious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you hear “high-fiber meal,” chances are you’re thinking about salads, hearty soups or even bean skillets. These are great and all, but what if I told you that my favorite high-fiber diner is none of these things, and it doesn’t skimp on comfort?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meet the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-potato-tzatziki-bowls-11686979" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Potato Tzatziki Bowls&lt;/a&gt; that I swear by. Although they star roasted potatoes, the fresh and vibrant in this dish really shine any time of year. Besides the delicious mix of tangy and herby flavors, there’s so many things that I love about this dinner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s hard to pick a place to start, but let’s talk about its surprising nutrition content. Thanks to the chickpeas, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions, these bowls are loaded with fiber, packing 10 grams per serving, which is 40% of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-it-looks-like-to-eat-enough-fiber-11798470" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended daily value for women&lt;/a&gt;. I’m acutely aware that most Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;do not get enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; in their eating pattern, so I’m always looking for ways to include the satisfying essential nutrient in my meal, as consuming more fiber can help reduce &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;the risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (which runs in my family).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are they fibrous, but these bowls are also protein-rich, even while being a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; meal. Combining chickpeas and homemade tzatziki made with strained (Greek-style) yogurt, each bowl serves 17 grams of protein per serving. I love incorporating more plant-based proteins into my meals, and I usually always have a can of chickpeas in my pantry or a tub of yogurt in my refrigerator, making shopping for this dinner that much easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Speaking of easy, this recipe notes that it takes a total of 45 minutes to make, but the busy work is mostly just chopping veggies and mixing up the tzatziki. Once you have everything prepared, it’s easy: the base of the bowl is the tzatziki, then top with your chickpeas and veggies, add your roasted potatoes and drizzle the whole thing with some really good olive oil. Personally, I’ve been loving &lt;a href="https://canaanpalestine.com/products/rumi-olive-oil" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Canaan Palestine’s Rumi Olive Oil&lt;/a&gt; lately for its bold flavor, and it’s amazingly all-purpose, so I can use it for the potatoes as well as for the finish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If I haven’t convinced you yet to make these tzatziki bowls, I don’t know what will. In fact, I just convinced myself to make them for dinner tonight. And I may even pair it with leftover Christmas cookies and New Year’s wine… it’s called balance!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I, like many other girls with anxiety and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-acba5fa0-dc38-11f0-97f1-f583eb887e9d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, had suffered from digestive maladies my entire life, gifting me a catch-all condition diagnosis of IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took decades - and becoming a registered dietician - to finally free myself from the food noise that had controlled my erratic eating habits and get in the best shape of my life as I approach my 40s, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-15378471/Doctor-reveals-exactly-protein-eating-avoid-Ozempic-face.html"&gt;without drugs&lt;/a&gt;, counting calories, or even restricting my favorite treats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a teenager, when my anxiety was managed, I generally felt just fine. But when I left my small town and moved to Toronto, the flares came on full force. I was ready to do whatever I had to do to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I didn’t realize it then, but this is often the bait of wellness culture - the illusion of purity disguised as care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the recommendation of a family friend, I visited a homeopathic naturopath who told me I had a mysterious sugar intolerance (dietitian fact check: that was fake news).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women's magazines teach us that even those with supermodel bodies can be taught to despise themselves based on their reflection or pants size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After just a few months, the food noise petered out, the incessant cravings disappeared, and Abbey's sleep, digestion, energy and mood improved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naturally, the supposed cure was a full sugar detox. I took these instructions to heart, tossing out every sauce, dressing, snack or drink that featured an ingredient ending in ‘-ose’ (shorthand for various forms of the sweet stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a few weeks of strict abstinence, some of my IBS symptoms were feeling better and bonus! I lost some weight. The compliments poured in with praise for my ‘discipline,’ my ‘health,’ and my evidently more toned body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naturally, my next thought was: ‘Well, if cutting out sugar gets me a round of applause, cutting out more bad things will get me a standing ovation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I then set my sights on fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Very quickly, my once-balanced diet of colorful salads, turkey burgers, and chocolate-chip cookies morphed into something joyless, bland and stale. What began as an experiment to feel better had very quickly swelled into a gripping fear of anything deemed unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as my list of ‘safe foods’ shrunk, so too did my increasingly feeble frame, stealing friendships, hobbies, laughter, and my identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t yet a formal diagnosis, but I now know what I was suffering from in my late teens was an eating disorder called orthorexia - often considered an obsessive pursuit of dietary purity and healthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In reality, I was less healthy than I’d ever been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when the binges started. After dragging myself through months of dry kale and microwaved egg whites with sugar-free hot sauce, I would binge on all the foods I had restricted. Mountains of fries, pizza, pasta, cheesecake, donuts, and ice cream, all within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With each week, the restrictions tightened, the binges swelled, and I plunged into a deeper state of depression and shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, as the validation I so desperately sought turned into whispers and words of concern, I knew something had to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of my recovery, I worked with a registered dietitian who helped me slowly get my weight to a healthier place, while also challenging the food fears that had overtaken my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the exercises I found most helpful was repeated exposure to my forbidden foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Abbey moved to Toronto, her anxiety flared and her eating grew more disordered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As part of her recovery, Abbey worked with a registered dietitian who helped her slowly get her weight to a healthier place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Abbey still enjoys her Lucky Charms, but eats them in a more healthy combo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When I was in the throes of my eating disorder, I had an obsession with sugary cereal. Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Frosted Flakes (oh my yum). If it was in my house on cheat day, I would polish off an entire box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So I started to eat Frosted Flakes every day. To my surprise, nothing terrible happened. In contrast, something quite wonderful ensued. I stopped caring about it. Eating cereal every day knocked it off its pedestal, loosened its moral grip and neutralized the power it held over me for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I continued this exposure therapy with lots of forbidden foods that I had been binging on, and in many cases, I learned that I don’t even like them that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In other cases, I discovered that I did still enjoy a previously forbidden food (pasta, bread, cheese - get at me!), but I just felt better when I ate them in moderation or alongside other nutritious foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when my &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/abbey-sharp-rd/the-hunger-crushing-combo-method/9781668654330/?lens=balance"&gt;Hunger Crushing Combo Method&lt;/a&gt; was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I found out for myself what is already backed up by science: that the simplest way to silence the food noise in our heads isn’t with drugs, calorie counting or the latest detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, by combining two or more of the Hunger Crushing Compounds - protein, fiber, and healthy fats - we can turn our favorite 'junk foods' into balanced meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the process, we crush the physical hunger and emotional cravings that are keeping us from reaching our healthiest happiest weight and a joyful relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, despite all the exposure I gave myself with sugary cereal, I still love it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when I removed the morality around it, I learned that eating a mountainous bowl of what we call ‘naked carbs’ in their birthday suit doesn’t always feel great. I might feel sluggish, I might feel a little backed up, and because naked carbs are rapidly digested and absorbed, I’d likely feel hungry again (and often a bit irritable thanks to the blood sugar crash) shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, foods rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats are the perfect anchors for naked carbs because they stimulate satiety hormones, quiet food noise and hunger hormones, balance blood sugars (so no spikes or subsequent crashes), and provide your body with the nutrients it needs to support focus, digestion, sleep and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In my case, I learned that if I build a big ol’ bowl of Greek yogurt (protein), added a handful of berries (fiber), a couple spoonfuls of nuts (healthy fats), and then topped it off with colorful magically delicious ‘breakfast marshmallows,’ I achieved both physical satiety and emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using the Hunger Crushing Combo method, you can still eat naked carbs like toast, but combine them with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On family pizza night, load your slice up with grilled chicken, mixed vegetables and olives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you love cookies, try serving them on a snack plate with pear (fiber), walnuts (healthy fats), and cheese (protein) to temper the blood sugar spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On family pizza night, load your slice up with grilled chicken, mixed vegetables and olives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you’re a breakfast bagel lover, build a sandwich with canned tuna, sliced veggies and greens, and smashed avocado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After just a few months of adding Hunger Crushing Compounds to the naked carbs I loved, the food noise in my head petered out, the incessant cravings disappeared, my sleep, digestion, energy and mood improved, and I settled into my healthiest, happiest weight and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And this isn’t just my unique response - we have so much research to support why a nourishing abundance mindset, instead of the restrictive mentality I was trapped in for so long, is the key to long-term behavior change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When we’re no longer distracted by the impending doom of the next D-day, we have the mental capacity to listen to our bodies' true needs and wants, and space in our lives for acts of self care that actually fill our cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hunger Crushing Combo Method works because it’s not another restrictive diet that depends on your willpower to white-knuckle through discomfort. It works with your biology and psychology to help optimize your health, regardless of your goal, life stage, or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, research suggests that combining foods rich in fiber, protein and healthy fats can help reduce blood sugar spikes by 30 to 50 per cent, can spontaneously (and effortlessly) help support excess fat loss and muscle growth, and can significantly reduce the long term risk of heart disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes and other chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it does all of this without restriction, deprivation or denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No risk, all rewards. No scarcity, just abundance. No fear, just loads of delicious, nourishing food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s simple science and a massive mindset shift. Welcome to a brand new world of fueling your body with confidence and joy. You’ll never look at a box of kids' cereal the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Hunger Crushing Combo Method by Abbey Sharp is published by Balance, January 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A person carrying measles traveled through Gaston County while infectious, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Health officials ask anyone who was at Constantine’s Restaurant in Gastonia after 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 26, 2025, to monitor for measles symptoms until Jan. 16.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The individual also attended Christmas Town USA in McAdenville from 5:30 to 8 p.m. on Dec. 26, 2025. The individual did not visit any indoor locations, so the risk of transmission of measles to others who were attending at the same time is low.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory disease that can be spread by coughing and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 30, 2025, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 2,065 people from 44 states as confirmed measles cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It also included 279 influenza-associated pediatric deaths, the highest reported to the agency during a seasonal influenza epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This year, a new variant, subclade K, has emerged and the flu season started earlier than usual in Europe, with “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/new-flu-strain-sweeping-across-europe-is-putting-pressure-on-healthcare-says-who" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high or very high influenza activity&lt;/a&gt;”, in December in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the United States, there had been an estimated 7.5m influenza cases and 81,000 hospitalizations by 20 December. That marked a 25% increase in cases over the previous week, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Thirty-two states&lt;/a&gt; have seen a “high or very high” number of flu illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A lot of people are getting the flu at the same time, which is always tough. That is actually tougher than a situation in which people get it and it’s spread out over a longer period,” Nuzzo said. “It could be a worse season, in part because more people are going to need care than hospitals can easily deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Epidemiologists are also concerned that fewer people could opt to get the flu vaccine because the CDC, led by the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, canceled &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj.r389" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;its campaign&lt;/a&gt; encouraging people to get the shot. At the start of December, about 130m flu vaccines had been distributed in the US, 13m less than at the same point last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccine-doses-distributed.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s completely incredulous to me that after experiencing the worst flu season for kids on record that we could head into this flu season – with signs that it could be bad, based on the viruses circulating out there – with anything but a robust plan to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some US residents could also be concerned about how much protection the new round of vaccine shots offer against the latest variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We have some reason to think that the protection may be lower, but I want to be careful by saying” that, Nuzzo said. “It may protect you less, but it’s likely still going to give you some important protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People also might not be aware that they can pick up an at-home test from a pharmacy, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are some people who might benefit from medication if they tested positive, but that medication needs to be given very soon after symptoms start,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQMDViMWVKYm1xc3FCalY1VVJ3cTF2NDRteHlJQWgwQl8zc3JMSWxGNTRVM09mSGZmYzZhdzl3MllTNDFRbG9FcGNhVjRrZTNnV0RkR1FaNVBoUnFPanl2TXBQUUlYekh6cDdkY2haUkpWMXVXZmpBRWxBNThUZVowdA</guid></item><item><title>服用维生素B12的最佳时间？ -健康：值得信赖且富有同理心的健康与保健信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-b12-11873881</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that supports red blood cell production, nerve function, energy metabolism, and DNA synthesis. A supplement can help fill gaps when you’re not getting enough vitamin B12 from foods like eggs, oysters, and salmon, but experts say there’s no single best time to take it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-take-vitamin-b12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-b12-7252832" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; is water-soluble, meaning it dissolves in water, it’s often best taken on an empty stomach with water, said &lt;a href="https://meganmeyerphd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Megan Meyer, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a science communication consultant based in Durham, North Carolina. Some limited evidence also suggests vitamin B12 could reduce sleep, so taking it earlier in the day may be a good idea.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, there’s no universally ideal time to take vitamin B12, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talia-follador-rdn-ldn-52842883/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Talia Follador, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Follador Nutrition Services. “What matters most is being consistent and taking the proper dosage,” she said.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-factors-that-can-make-a-difference"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the timing of vitamin B12 may not matter much, other factors can impact the efficacy of the supplement, said &lt;a href="https://www.corenutritionhw.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Pace, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a functional dietitian nutritionist &amp;amp; founder of Core Nutrition Health &amp;amp; Wellness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These include the form of the supplement, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/stomach-7644099" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stomach acid levels&lt;/a&gt;, existing B12 status, and the body’s ability to produce a protein called intrinsic factor, which is essential for absorption. “Think of it as a ‘shuttle bus’ that carries B12 through your digestive system into your bloodstream,” Pace told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. “Without it, your body can't absorb B12 from food, regardless of how much you eat.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For people who have trouble absorbing B12, higher-dose supplements or even injections may be necessary, Follador said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-who-may-benefit-from-vitamin-b12-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meyer recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/foods-with-the-most-vitamin-b12-11852167" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;getting vitamin B12 from food&lt;/a&gt; whenever possible. Many animal products naturally contain B12, and some foods—such as breakfast cereals, nutritional yeast, and plant-based milks—are fortified with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, people who are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/21-important-facts-about-vitamin-b12-deficiency" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;deficient in vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, which can be confirmed with a blood test, may benefit from supplements. Those who follow vegan or vegetarian diets, as well as people with conditions that impair nutrient absorption, such as celiac disease or Crohn’s disease, are more likely to be deficient, Meyer said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing weight is often recommended for hypertension since extra weight raises blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein- and fiber-rich meals boost fullness, while potassium and magnesium support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For snacks, dietitians suggest unsalted nuts, popcorn, yogurt with fruit, chia pudding and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight loss is often recommended for people with hypertension because carrying excess weight is linked to higher blood pressure levels and increased strain on the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that even modest weight loss can help lower blood pressure, making sustainable eating habits helpful for managing both.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That's where snacking comes in. Foods that provide protein and fiber increase satiety and reduce cravings, while those that include potassium and magnesium help regulate blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Choosing nutrient-dense snacks can increase satisfaction between meals, supporting both weight loss and heart health. Ahead, dietitians share snack ideas that do just that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians agree that strained (Greek-style) yogurt is a great snack option for weight loss if you have high blood pressure, especially when paired with high-potassium fruits like bananas and kiwis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Greek yogurt is a good source of protein to keep you feeling full, while banana and kiwi provide potassium to help manage sodium levels in the body," says  &lt;a href="https://www.willowlabs.ai/products/nutu/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dawn Menning, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium helps the kidneys excrete excess sodium and supports the relaxation of blood vessel walls, both of which play an important role in blood pressure regulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not a fan of bananas and kiwi? &lt;a href="https://www.mayazbites.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maya Oueichek, M.B.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, recommends pairing strained (Greek-style) yogurt with berries and chia seeds. In addition to supporting satiety, strained (Greek-style) yogurt's protein helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Berries contribute fiber and potassium, while chia seeds provide omega-3 fats and magnesium—nutrients that support healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Hummus is rich in plant-based fiber, protein and magnesium," says Oueichek, nutrients that are helpful for weight loss and managing hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For veggies, she recommends carrots and bell peppers because they're a good source of potassium and naturally low in sodium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "This combo promotes fullness, stable blood sugar and supports vascular function," Oueichek adds, all of which are important for weight loss and managing blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's important to keep sodium in check if you have high blood pressure, so choose low-sodium hummus options or make your own at home.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Excess sodium intake is directly linked to elevated blood pressure," says Oueichek.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/256571/garlic-hummus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Garlic Hummus&lt;/a&gt; recipe, and enhance flavor with lemon juice, garlic and spices instead of salt.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts support heart health by improving blood lipids, supporting healthy blood pressure and reducing inflammation. These benefits come from their mix of unsaturated fats, plant protein, fiber, phytosterols and minerals potassium and magnesium—nutrients linked to cardiovascular protection.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enjoying nuts with a side of fruit can make an even more satisfying snack. "Fruit paired with a handful of nuts promotes satiety since fiber, protein and healthy fat slow digestion," says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. She notes that this combination also provides potassium and magnesium, minerals that aid in blood pressure control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fiber and protein in nuts can also help reduce cravings, which may support weight loss, says Menning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Go with unsalted varieties to best support your blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Chia seed pudding provides healthy fat, protein, fiber, magnesium and potassium—nutrients that help slow digestion, regulate hunger and support heart health and blood pressure control," says Gaw. Research suggests chia seed consumption may help lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, likely due to its effects on vascular function and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are also a source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to cardiovascular benefits, including reduced inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Preparing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; with cow's milk adds calcium and protein, further supporting heart health and satiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Air-popped popcorn contains fiber, which has been linked to benefits for digestive health, blood sugar regulation, heart health and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A fiber-rich snack helps slow digestion and promote fullness, which can keep you feeling full and satisfied between meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians recommend being thoughtful when seasoning your snacks. Oueichek suggests sprinkling popcorn with smoked paprika, cinnamon, cumin or chili powder instead of salt. "Or you can add nutritional yeast to give it a cheesy, savory flavor without adding sodium," says Menning. Nutritional yeast also provides B vitamins, fiber and a small amount of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snacks can help you lose weight and manage blood pressure when chosen thoughtfully. Balanced choices that combine protein and fiber increase satiety, while nutrients like potassium and magnesium support heart and blood vessel health. Rather than skipping snacks, aim to be intentional. Choose whole, nutrient-dense foods—like fruit, vegetables, yogurt, nuts and whole grains—to help you reach your goals.

			&lt;p&gt;Roman soldiers garrisoned at the fort of Vindolanda, located near Hadrian's Wall in northern England, were riddled with parasites that sapped their fighting fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to lice-infested tunics and runny noses, Rome's military might have dealt with chronic gut infections that caused diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea, according to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt;jointly performed archaeological study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by researchers from Cambridge and Oxford.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen," says Marissa Ledger, an archaeologist at McMaster University in Canada who co-led the study while completing her PhD at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing fitness for duty. Helminths alone can cause nausea, cramping, and diarrhea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-british-history-s-most-worm-infested-people-and-it-s-not-who-d-imagine"&gt;Study Reveals British History's Most Worm-Infested People, And It's Not Who You Think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed just under 60 samples of sewer drain sediments containing ancient poop and other detritus that washed away from the fort and nearby settlements, dating to the 3rd century CE.

These finds include more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-roman-bigfoot-unusually-large-shoes-puzzle-archaeologists"&gt;5,000 leather shoes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-wooden-phallus-might-be-a-rare-2000-year-old-dildo"&gt;wooden phallus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets"&gt;over 1,700 thin wooden tablets&lt;/a&gt; inscribed with ink, which document day-to-day habits at the fort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This daily martial life would have revolved around guarding Hadrian's Wall, just north of the fort. Established in the early 2nd century CE, the wall is a defensive fortification running east-to-west from the North Sea to the Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ease occupation on this Roman-British frontier, the fort had baths, toilets, and drinking water. Regardless, the soldiers still suffered from intestinal infections, including roundworms, whipworms, and potentially &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;Giardia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/giardiasis/index.html"&gt;diarrhea-causing&lt;/a&gt; microscopic single-celled animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latter pathogen is an exciting find for researchers, if not so much for those past soldiers, because it's the first evidence of &lt;em&gt;Giardia duodenalis&lt;/em&gt; in Roman Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Vindolanda's bath complex, with its previously mentioned amenities, outbreaks occurred due to poor sanitary practices. Specifically, fecal contamination in food, water, and on the soldiers' hands helped spread these parasites throughout the fort and throughout time – samples collected from a fortification constructed in 85 CE also contained roundworm and whipworm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, parasite sufferers would have become severely ill from dehydration via chronic infections that could linger for weeks, "causing dramatic fatigue and weight loss." These conditions bred other severely deleterious intestinal pathogens, setting the scene for outbreaks of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written or uncovered evidence reveals many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/roman-trade-routes-carried-tuberculosis-across-globe"&gt;other types of Roman-reared infections&lt;/a&gt;. On one occasion, 10 soldiers were deemed unfit for duty due to conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, which &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/conjunctivitis-caused-by-poop"&gt;can occur&lt;/a&gt; when eyes come into contact with poop-laden fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the parasite profile at Vindolanda is similar to that from other Roman military sites, including those in Austria, the Netherlands, and Scotland. One reason may be the more-limited, pork-heavy diet, as described in preserved texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, "Urban sites, such as London and York, had a more diverse parasite range, including fish and meat tapeworms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for all the modern romanticism surrounding Roman hygiene, the history is often dirtier and more fecal-infested than imagined. It's also worth noting that nearly 2,000 years ago, Vindolanda sat at Rome's northwestern frontier, and frontier settlements often faced the harshest hardships – made all the harsher when its defenders had 30-centimeter (12-inch) roundworms snaking through their guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt;Parasitology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has identified three public places someone with measles may have exposed others to the disease.Thoe locations are:Nose Dive restaurant at 116 S. Main Street, Greenville, S.C. on Dec. 24 from 1:30 to 4:30 pmBest Buy at 1125 Woodruff Road, Suite 1201, Greenville, S.C. on Dec. 24 from 3 to 6 p.m.The Spartanburg County Public Library at 151 at S. Church Street, Spartanburg, S.C. for the Solar Superstorms planetarium show on Dec. 27 from 3:15 to 6:30 p.m. According to DPH, the person did not know they were infectious at the time. DPH is not aware of any risk for measles exposure at these locations beyond this period of time."People exposed at any of these locations who are not immune could begin developing early symptoms of measles now," a DPH official said Saturday. "DPH is asking anyone who was at any of these locations during those specific days and times to contact your health care provider if you believe you may have been exposed, if you do not have immunity to measles or if you develop symptoms.""People who were exposed, especially those without immunity through vaccination or previous disease, should monitor for symptoms through Jan. 17. Symptoms typically begin within 7-12 days (but up to 21 days) after exposure, and start with a cough, runny nose, and red eyes, along with a mild to moderate fever.""Two or three days later, the fever spikes, often as high as 104°F. At the same time, a red blotchy rash appears, first on the face and head, then rapidly spreads down the remainder of the body. A person with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after its onset, so someone may be able to spread measles before they know they have the disease. It is important to stay home if you are ill.""If anyone who may have been exposed develops an illness with fever (101°F or more), cough, runny nose or red eyes, with or without rash, immediately call a health care provider and let them know about the exposure and symptoms so that they can tell you what to do next. Special arrangements will be needed to evaluate you without putting other patients and medical office staff at risk of exposure. You will be asked to stay at home until the doctor clears you.""The MMR vaccine is the most effective way of protecting oneself against measles. Anyone who is not up to date on MMR vaccination or does not have immunity from prior infection, is encouraged to receive a dose of MMR vaccine, unless there is a medical reason why you cannot receive it. The MMR vaccine is effective and safe. The DPH Recommendations for MMR Vaccination chart can help you understand if you need a dose of the vaccine. The MMR vaccine is available at a pharmacy or provider included on the DPH online vaccine locator or at DPH Health Departments."

It begins decades before you ever feel a symptom. And while that sounds terrifying…it’s actually the most empowering truth you’ll hear today: Your brain’s future isn’t fixed. You can change your trajectory - starting right now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritise omega-3s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alejandra advises prioritising &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/dicomega3-benefits-and-dosage-explained-by-a-doctor-find-top-rated-omega-3-supplements-on-amazon-india-for-daily-healt-101766122868355.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="omega-3"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; rich foods - such as fatty fish like sardines and salmon, along with nuts and seeds like chia, flaxseeds and walnuts - almost as if it were your job, noting that they play a key role in supporting brain health and calming inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains, “Your brain is 60 percent fat, and omega-3s are the raw materials it needs to repair, protect, and stay sharp. EPA and DHA literally build your brain cells and calm inflammation - two things that matter for dementia risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Treat sleep like brain-washing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to the health coach, sleep acts like a deep cleansing cycle for the brain, clearing out metabolic waste - including proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease - that accumulate during the day and are flushed out while you sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains, “While you sleep, your brain flushes out waste - including the proteins linked to Alzheimer’s. If you skip sleep, that waste doesn’t get cleared. Your nighttime routine is not a luxury. It’s a neuroprotective strategy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid spiking blood sugar frequently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Alejandra warns against repeatedly spiking blood sugar throughout the day, noting that frequent glucose highs and crashes can accelerate brain ageing and impair long-term cognitive health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; She highlights, “Glucose spikes equals inflammation, energy crashes, mood swings, and faster brain ageing. Balanced blood sugar keeps your mind clear and your neurons happy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health coach recommends always prioritising proteins and fibres, along with some form of movement after meals to balance out glucose spikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Move every 2-3 hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Alejandra, regular movement is essential for brain health and shouldn’t be limited to a single 30-minute workout. She emphasises the importance of moving your body every two to three hours throughout the day to support overall brain wellbeing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains, “Movement increases blood flow to your brain right away. Strength training boosts BDNF - aka ‘Miracle-Gro’ for your brain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eat to lower inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to the health coach, inflammation acts as a silent accelerant of cognitive decline, and prioritising targeted, anti-inflammatory nutrition on a daily basis can support brain health and potentially lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recommends, “Whole, colourful foods protect your neurons, your mitochondria, and your long-term memory. More greens, berries, olive oil, fish, herbs, turmeric, veggies. Less processed chaos.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This results in a sudden glucose spike in the bloodstream and guarantees a sugar crash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rule 3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Always pair carbs with proteins and fats,” noted Dr Vatsya. “This slows down digestion and allows glucose to be steadily released in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rule 4&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Vatsya, post-meal movement should be mandatory. Studies have shown that walking for 10-12 minutes after every meal is more effective than a long workout, he claimed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rule 5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adding one spoonful of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apple-cider-vinegar-for-weight-loss-nutritionists-guide-on-how-to-use-this-drink-before-bed-101766820243509.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="apple cider vinegar"&gt;apple cider vinegar&lt;/a&gt; to our salad at the start of meals, insulin response becomes smoother, shared Dr Vatsya.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Stopping sugar crashes is not difficult if eating habits and blood glucose are monitored with discipline,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The research also suggests that women who engage in self-stimulation during adolescence may experience orgasms more frequently with partners later in life. These findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2025.2565374" target="_blank"&gt;International Journal of Sexual Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitary sexual activity is a normal aspect of human development and is widely practiced. Despite its prevalence, the subject often remains surrounded by silence and social stigma. This is particularly true for women, who have historically faced different social standards regarding sexuality compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous scientific literature has established that masturbation can offer health benefits and improve sexual functioning. However, less is known about the specific psychological and social factors that influence this behavior in women. A lack of open discussion often leads to gaps in information regarding female biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers Daniela Henriques, Pedro Alexandre Costa, and Ana Carvalheira sought to investigate these dynamics. Henriques is affiliated with the ISPA-University Institute in Lisbon, Portugal. The team aimed to assess how much women understand about their genital anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also wanted to identify which demographic and personal factors are linked to the frequency of masturbation. Another primary goal was to analyze the connection between early sexual experiences and adult sexual satisfaction. The researchers were particularly interested in how habits formed during teenage years might relate to the ability to reach orgasm with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, the scientists designed a web-based survey. They recruited 469 adult women of Portuguese nationality to participate. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey included a specialized questionnaire designed to measure knowledge of female anatomy. This section presented statements about the vulva, vagina, and clitoris. Participants had to identify whether these statements were true or false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One section of the study assessed “genital self-image.” This concept refers to a woman’s feelings and beliefs regarding her own genitals. The survey asked participants to rate their agreement with statements about their comfort with and perception of their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also collected detailed data on sexual behaviors. They asked about the age at which participants first masturbated. They also inquired about the frequency of this behavior during adolescence and within the past twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results regarding anatomical knowledge revealed substantial gaps in understanding. The data showed that roughly 74 percent of the participants possessed a low or average level of knowledge about female genitalia. Misconceptions were particularly common regarding the clitoris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey included specific questions about the size and shape of the clitoris. For example, it asked if the clitoris is an internal structure shaped like the wings of an airplane. A majority of the women did not identify this as a true statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many participants also held incorrect beliefs about the physical dimensions of the clitoris. Nearly half of the respondents provided incorrect answers regarding its length. These findings highlight a pervasive lack of education regarding the internal structure of the primary organ responsible for female pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these gaps in knowledge, the prevalence of masturbation was high. Approximately 96 percent of the women reported having masturbated at some point in their lives. The average age at which they began this behavior was just over 14 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequency of current masturbation varied among the group. The most common frequency reported was once a week. About one-quarter of the active participants selected this option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical analysis to determine which factors best predicted how often a woman masturbates. They found that age was a strong predictor. Younger women tended to report higher frequencies of self-stimulation than older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place of residence also appeared to play a role. Women living in urban environments reported masturbating more often than those in rural areas. The researchers suggest that urban settings might offer more privacy or exposure to progressive views on sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationship status was another determining factor. Single women reported engaging in solitary sexual activity more frequently than those in committed relationships. This finding aligns with the idea that some women use masturbation to replace partnered sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious attendance showed a clear negative association with the behavior. Women who attended religious services more often were less likely to masturbate frequently. This likely reflects the influence of conservative moral teachings regarding autoeroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond demographics, the study found a strong link between anatomical knowledge and behavior. Women who scored higher on the anatomy quiz tended to masturbate more often. This suggests that understanding one’s body may facilitate sexual expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerged regarding genital self-image. Women who felt more positive about the appearance and function of their genitals were more likely to engage in self-stimulation. Comfort with one’s body appears to remove barriers to sexual exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered an association between adolescent behavior and adult sexual response. Women who reported higher frequencies of masturbation during their teenage years experienced orgasms more often during partnered sex as adults. This correlation was observed specifically for orgasms achieved during vaginal penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that early self-exploration serves a learning function. Through masturbation, adolescents may discover what types of stimulation they prefer. This self-knowledge can then be transferred to sexual interactions with partners later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the relationship between current masturbation and partnered sex showed a different pattern. For adult women, a higher frequency of masturbation was associated with a lower frequency of orgasm during partnered sexual activity. This suggests a compensatory dynamic for some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that for some adult women, masturbation may serve to fill a gap left by unsatisfying partnered encounters. If a woman does not reach orgasm with her partner, she may turn to self-stimulation to achieve sexual release. The data supports both the idea of masturbation as a learning tool and as a compensatory act, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted several limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. The study relied on a convenience sample recruited online. This method may attract participants who are more comfortable discussing sexuality than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample consisted entirely of cisgender women from Portugal. Cultural and religious specifics of the country may influence the findings. Consequently, the results might not fully apply to women in different cultural or legal environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also relied on self-reported data. This introduces the possibility of recall bias, particularly when participants were asked to remember behaviors from their adolescence. Additionally, the study did not provide a rigid definition of masturbation, leaving it open to participant interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the research offers evidence that female masturbation is a multifaceted behavior. It highlights the importance of comprehensive sex education. The authors argue that education should go beyond reproduction to include anatomy and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better knowledge of the clitoris and other structures could help destigmatize female sexuality. Promoting a positive genital self-image could also improve sexual well-being. The researchers recommend that future studies investigate these relationships in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also suggest that clinical interventions for sexual difficulties should consider masturbatory history. Understanding a patient’s comfort with their own body can provide context for treating sexual dysfunction. Ultimately, the study reinforces the idea that solitary sex is an integral part of a woman’s sexual health profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2025.2565374" target="_blank"&gt;‘Ménage À Moi’: An Analysis of Factors Associated with Masturbation Among Women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daniela Henriques, Pedro Alexandre Costa, and Ana Carvalheira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:10:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPdWx5ZndEWnd6dGZwaFdlTkUyUDg1MnZuZEs5TDY0NldwN09ycXBIT1RneWdNcFZNM2NsdW8xVkRDaVRDV0lmNlV5dkFZeVdQRVlHeUpOemU4dDlMRzI1UDhXVFdvNE5tSVU4Vnc2SmVBRmNxcEVmeFU5V2NlSFJBVU1OMUpYcjRuMEU3STZpTlpmdw</guid></item><item><title>全球最具传染性的疾病正在美国机场蔓延-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-contagious-disease-world-spreading-150000558.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.explore.com/travel/coronavirus-flying-hotels-travel-safety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes&lt;/a&gt; to how people get around. &lt;a href="https://www.explore.com/travel/avoid-sick-traveling/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Avoiding getting sick while traveling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Avoiding getting sick while traveling&lt;/a&gt; is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The New Jersey Department of Health sent a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20251226a.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025.

Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Getting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ready to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips? &lt;a href="https://subscribe.explore.com/newsletter-syndicated?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=explore-NL-feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to our free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to our free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for access to the world's best-kept travel secrets.

But, not all LED materials are the same. Some are &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/home-entertainment/tvs/articles/oled-vs-qled-tvs-whats-181700645.html" data-ylk="slk:OLEDs or QLEDs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;OLEDs or QLEDs&lt;/a&gt;, while others are a bit more nuanced. Some don't even allow you to move electricity through them. It's this later group that has attracted some intriguing attention from scientists in recent years, and now, a group of researchers working with the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge have made an intriguing discovery that could change how we think about LEDs altogether. According to the study, which was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09601-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have managed to move electricity through tiny insulating particles that aren't typically capable of conducting electricity. These particles are made up of various elements, including some rare-earth elements such as neodymium and ytterbium, and the breakthrough here could potentially open new doors for LED technology as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;Researchers note that the particles in question, called insulating lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) have been known to shine very brightly when they are placed under light. However, scientists have always struggled to get the particles to actually conduct electricity. Previous attempts to do just that have shown that charges often can't reach the lanthanide ions inside without extreme heat or voltage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;To bypass this issue, those involved in this new study began looking for a way to hybridize the particles instead. They used 9-ACA organic dye molecules with the LnNPs, letting them replace the surface insulators on the particles, thus allowing them to be charged using a technique known as triplet energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/12-real-life-inventions-were-140200013.html" data-ylk="slk:12 Real-Life Inventions That Were Inspired By Science Fiction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;12 Real-Life Inventions That Were Inspired By Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading-mb col-body heading-text-style font-bold charcoal-color"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-[0.875rem]/[1.25rem] figure-caption mt-1 line-clamp-2 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;a group of researchers working in a lab - Gorodenkoff/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;According to the study, the biggest issue that held the LnNPs from being electrically excited is their energy gap. In the past, this limited these particles to only being used in deep-tissue imaging that didn't rely on electric energy. By replacing the surface insulators, though, the researchers managed to bypass this core problem, thus opening the door to use these particles in more expanded LED operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;And when the changes were made, the scientists were then able to inject electrons into the organic layer, thus forming what they call "excitons." From here, the energy is transferred to the lanthanide ions, which allows them to emit an almost completely pure near-infrared (NIR) light, even going so far as to out perform most other organic NIR LEDs in both narrowness and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;The researchers say that these new LnLEDs open a lot of possibilities for hybrid optoelectronics in biomedical tools. This could allow for better non-bleaching deep imaging applications. Whether this advancement is as huge as previous &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/scientific-breakthrough-could-make-x-ray-scans-safer-by-reducing-radiation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research that aimed to make X-rays safer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research that aimed to make X-rays safer&lt;/a&gt; or not still remains to be seen, but it does open a lot of new possibilities. The researchers say they still want to improve on the brightness offered by the new hybrid LEDs, but the current method should be easily scalable to other insulators, allowing for even more experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;Enjoyed this article? &lt;a href="https://subscribe.bgr.com/newsletter-syndicated?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=bgr-NL-feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up to BGR's free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sign up to BGR's free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=bgr.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:add us as a preferred search source;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;add us as a preferred search source&lt;/a&gt; for the latest in tech and entertainment, plus tips and advice you'll actually use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0 charcoal-color"&gt;Read the &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/2063887/scientists-led-breakthrough-nanoparticles/?zsource=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:original article on BGR;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;original article on BGR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo!
