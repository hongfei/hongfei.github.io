She also began coughing incessantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J7XQDATGKNCMNMNFUMCC7GBI3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day,” says Cresencia, now 27, who works remotely for a health insurance company as a user experience manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WZZ5YLV5JGRVGBDRXFEDGGI2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“She was also coughing up small amounts of blood,” recalls Nguyen, now 28, a software engineer. “It really freaked me out,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUHA6P3NBIRMJJPTXSKUSZQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nevertheless, they continued on with the trip but curtailed their activities and food, and flew home at the end of the week. Once back in San Diego, Cresencia says, “the symptoms seemed to calm down a bit, I started to go days without throwing up, and my breathing also improved. I told myself it had to have been something about New York.” But a few weeks later, while in the San Francisco Bay Area visiting Nguyen, she suddenly developed a new and worrisome symptom: very swollen feet. “They didn’t hurt. They were just filled with fluid,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KHLKXQVZ7JBDTA5FVVGIGWYZVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen took her to an urgent care facility, where doctors ran a series of tests, including a CT scan that found a mass on her heart, a shocking discovery in someone so young. She was terrified. “My heart dropped and my ears felt hot,” she recalls. “How did it form? Did I have cancer? Did I do something wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VIBGWUUL4NCTBOJNLRM7AHSIKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The finding was the start of a harrowing months-long ordeal to figure out what the mass was, including a biopsy that nearly killed her and the radical surgery that saved her life — and revealed what had made her so sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EN4JZIIJWJAY3NNU5JPDGSOWAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While I do wish I would have gotten my health checked sooner, I’ve found myself focusing less on the past and more on enjoying the now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AMHHYQAFVFEVXOQN24PDJAD6DE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AMHHYQAFVFEVXOQN24PDJAD6DE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;From urgent care to the hospital&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRE2OJFWYJGB5PDBWOU2MYKDIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia had been coping with shortness of breath for several years, mostly when walking up hills, but she ignored it, thinking it was too “subtle” to bother seeing a doctor. The New York trip changed that. “It was worse than usual,” she says, and the bouts of nausea and bloody coughing were new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J47XN4DOZVBFLLT7QY243DATTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the urgent care, doctors were clearly worried about the mass they’d seen on the CT scan and urged Cresencia to go to the hospital. The couple went to a small community hospital near Nguyen’s home in the San Francisco Bay Area. After a six-hour wait, a physician finally examined her and immediately admitted her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6FYURH5XVFFTJ6DWPO4WYT45E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next day, wanting a closer look, the doctors at the hospital ran a transesophageal echocardiogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to view detailed images of the heart and its surrounding structures. It showed a large growth in the left atrium, one of the heart’s two upper chambers, and doctors told her it almost certainly was the underlying cause of her symptoms. They recommended she seek specialty care at a larger hospital, and a week later, in San Diego, doctors at a second hospital ran additional tests, saw the mass and also told her they thought they saw “holes in my lungs,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GWVGMNAJ6JAQBCB4QM5SWMBWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctors told her she would probably need a heart-lung transplant and sent her to Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego Health in La Jolla, the only hospital in the area that performs such surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="BHBM76UGCBD65EPZHX2I3N33QA" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Chelsea Cresencia &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MANK6X3NCZCQLOHUTMBFLS3SXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, cardiac specialists told Cresencia there were no holes in her lungs, but they thought she had an angiosarcoma of the heart, a rare and virulent cancer that originates in the lining of the blood vessels and has a grim prognosis. “They told me … it wouldn’t look good if that’s what it was,” she says. “I was terrified. I cried a lot because I was scared of dying and afraid of losing Allen and my family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GFK6GNHLJFFXFEOYANG6VS434" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The treatment for angiosarcoma varies, depending on the tumor’s size and location, and can involve both surgery and chemotherapy. Even then, the outlook is very poor, with survival often less than two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XN2CYBXVIFGZRG7525NY43MOZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her UC San Diego cardiologist, Marcus Urey, who is director of heart transplantation and cardiac amyloidosis, felt he needed to confirm his presumptive diagnosis before deciding on the most appropriate treatment — whether to start chemotherapy, for example — so the doctors attempted a biopsy. But that procedure failed when they couldn’t get a probe past the outer rim of the mass to collect the needed cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZM4E6EBDVRFKLAYNGO7LIZS3K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A second attempt was even worse: The mass was blocking veins that carry blood from the lungs into the left side of the heart, where the mass was, which was causing pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the lungs. Under anesthesia, the right side of Cresencia’s heart — already under strain — experienced failure and circulatory collapse, known as shock. When this happens, the circulatory system is unable to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7I7WV37PBDDJKJ7E5TIRBUNVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To save her, the doctors hooked Cresencia up to life-support technology that takes over a patient’s breathing and heart function. She was on an ECMO — or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine for 10 days, intubated and sedated until she finally stabilized, and while her doctors debated what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YMHQOXLXFAQFMSB7K4GE4OUME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They decided they had no choice but to operate and remove as much of the mass as possible, even not knowing exactly what it was. Given that her heart failure was worsening, “there were no other options other than trying to remove as much of the tumor as possible. … Without surgery, we considered her prognosis terminal,” Urey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IABDCWPQ45CEJN2ABGTBT25DZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I told the surgeon she will die if we do nothing,” Urey recalls, and then reached out to her family “and everyone was on the same page. She was&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at high risk of dying if we identified a sarcoma, but had a 100 percent certainty of death if we did nothing. Everyone wanted to give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZVBDXDGIPFF43GKJ6LSJ7ICPKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They scheduled immediate surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBJLTB5EMFDCBJ4U4BJVC6Z3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has no memory of her time on ECMO or of going into surgery. However, her doctors and Nguyen recall how at one point she scribbled “I love you” with a permanent marker on the arms of Nguyen, her parents and her five siblings. The night before her surgery, Cresencia gave her surgeon, Victor Pretorius, a fist bump and handed him a note where she had written: “You got this!” Pretorius recalls her anxiety. “I could see it in her eyes, the fear. She was really courageous, trying to say goodbye to her family. It was very hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVMGKUXPEJCK5PE7K52C2TK6KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The surgery took nearly 10 hours and involved an 11-person team of two surgeons, three anesthesiologists, four nurses and two technicians. With Cresencia still on ECMO, Pretorius removed her heart and — while it was outside her body — cut away the tumor and reconstructed the affected left atrium using artificial pig tissue. He also removed scar tissue from three of four pulmonary veins to open them up. He says he couldn’t do much with the fourth because it was too scarred. The doctors then put her heart back into her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SRWNDQRRKNHRVP4A4OHWNTIPGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pretorius says the mass he’d removed “looked nothing like angiosarcoma. It was hard and leathery. I wasn’t sure what it was. I took a piece of it and sent it to the pathologist for a quick evaluation. They called back within an hour and told us they didn’t see any malignant cells.” So it was not a deadly angiosarcoma as they had feared. But pathologists saw a type of white blood cell called histiocytes, which provided the first real clue about what was wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The pathology report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPJNPH2EZRAD7O2QISSZLMLGQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the final pathology report finally came in, the analysis found that the mass was made up of a proliferation of histiocytes — the hallmark of a very rare disorder known as &lt;a href="https://histio.org/histiocytic-disorders/rosai-dorfman-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosai-Dorfman disease&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that most often affects children, teens and young adults. Only about 1 in every 200,000 people get it, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It causes an overgrowth of the immune system’s white blood cells, most often in lymph nodes, leading to excessive swelling, but also much less commonly in other sites in the body as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OJONIP54BJHQRNE76OQOIA2VUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most physicians have never heard of it,” says Aaron Goodman, the UC San Diego hematologist who now is monitoring her. “They don’t know what it is and have never seen it. [It] is an incredibly rare disease to begin with, and hers was a very rare presentation of a very rare disease. It was in a bad spot and could have been lethal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HUUKVRME5ZHBBH4DZGPGG2YSEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some patients, treatment includes the use of medications such as steroids, drugs to suppress the immune system and sometimes chemotherapy. In Cresencia’s case, however, physicians believe they removed the entire tumor, so “there is nothing for me to do except surveillance,” Goodman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DJ4F6KRJZ5D6FFDNVQKT4YH4HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has periodic MRIs to ensure it doesn’t return — and so far, it hasn’t. Goodman says it can come back, but experts don’t know what percentage of patients experience a recurrence. Cresencia’s last checkup in April was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C37VQACTRFE6DCRQ4LAWUH7JAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for her ordeal, Cresencia says she feels fortunate and “incredibly grateful”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to the doctors at UC San Diego not only for figuring out what was wrong but also for their “genuine kindness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOHEQYWURZFRNOGCMWBRXSUTGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In February, during the week including Valentine’s Day, Cresencia and Nguyen, now living together in the Bay Area, returned to New York, a “redemption trip,” she says, where they walked and explored the city every day without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TKIMAN6RHJD2XC3X45B27DHLIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I have come to really appreciate all the ‘firsts’ I get to experience,” she says, including snow that fell during their first night in the city. “As a true Californian, I have never really seen the kind of snow that blankets over sidewalks and grazes against your eyelashes.

Scientists created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas to profile gene expression across 219 cell types in flies expressing human Alzheimer’s proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that Aβ42 mainly damages neurons, particularly those tied to senses like smell, while Tau impacts peripheral tissues, disrupting metabolism, digestion, and fertility. These findings highlight how Alzheimer’s disrupts brain-body communication and accelerates aging-like changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-Body Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 and Tau proteins affect both brain and peripheral tissues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 harms sensory neurons, while Tau disrupts metabolism and fertility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Research Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fly Cell Atlas enables exploration of Alzheimer’s beyond the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Alzheimer’s disease is mostly considered a disorder of the brain, emerging evidence suggests that the condition also affects other organs of the body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the laboratory fruit fly, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital (Duncan NRI) and collaborating institutions provide a new understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease affects different tissues across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110043"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, reveal new insights into brain-body communication in neurodegeneration and pave the way for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques containing the Aβ42 protein and tangles of thread-like structures of the Tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To better understand how the disorder affects other organs in the body, we created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas, which profiles the genes expressed by single cells of 219 cell types in the heads and bodies of Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies,” said co-corresponding author Dr.  Hongjie Li, assistant professor of molecular and human genetics and the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also a member of Baylor’s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. This approach avoids developmental effects and focuses on adult characteristics. Then, they assessed the presence of changes in the brains and other organs of these modified flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that expressing Aβ42 or Tau in neurons affected both neurons and other tissues in the fruit fly body,” said co-first author Ye-Jin Park, a graduate student co-mentored by Li and Dr. Hugo Bellen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aβ42 expression primarily affected the nervous system. Sensory neurons involved in vision, audition and olfaction were particularly vulnerable. A decline in the sense of smell can be an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, and in this study we identified specific olfactory neurons affected by Aβ42 in fruit flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, Tau expression in neurons led to significant changes, mostly in peripheral tissues, for instance altered fat metabolism and digestion and reduced fecundity. These alterations mimic age-associated changes, suggesting that Tau expression accelerates aging,” said co-first author Dr. Tzu-Chiao Lu, a postdoctoral associate in the Li lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that neuronal connectivity and other factors that mediate brain-body communication were disrupted in Tau flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These and other findings described in the Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas improve our understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease-associated proteins, Aβ42 and Tau, affect an organism as a whole,” said Bellen, co-corresponding author of the work. Bellen is a Distinguished Service Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor and chair in neurogenetics&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the Duncan NRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive resource serves as a valuable tool for the neurodegeneration research community. The Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas enables further exploration of whole-body changes and brain-body interactions in Alzheimer’s disease that may lead to a better understanding of the condition and improved treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Tyler Jackson, Lindsey goodman, Lindsey Ran, Jiaye Chen, Chung-Yi Liang, Erin Harrison, Christina Ko, Xi Chen, Baiping Wang, Ao-Lin Hsu, Elizabeth Ochoa, Kevin F.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how AD impacts different tissues across the whole organism is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;, we generated an AD Fly Cell Atlas (AD-FCA) based on whole-organism single-nucleus transcriptomes of 219 cell types from flies expressing AD-associated proteins, either human amyloid-β 42 peptide (Aβ42) or Tau, in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that Aβ42 primarily affects the nervous system, including sensory neurons, while Tau induces accelerated aging in peripheral tissues. We identified a neuronal cluster enriched in Aβ42 flies, which has high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This LDH-high cluster is conserved in 5XFAD mouse and human AD datasets. We found a conserved defect in fat metabolism from both fly and mouse tauopathy models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AD-FCA offers new insights into how Aβ42 or Tau systemically and differentially affects a whole organism and provides a valuable resource for understanding brain-body communication in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 12:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBITnRLNkxnUHJlWmdkUkxnYkFvbFQ3NzVPM19PR2dtc2RocnU2VjNzb05TVVdyZXpXaF9wTnpsbmx2MWJ2QzN3RGZJSFZfMXhDd3BjX005RGNxODZNd1dmNlBwcy1KUXJ1</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现清醒梦既不是睡眠也不是清醒，而是全新的东西- The Daily Galaxy | Scientists Discover Lucid Dreaming Is Neither Sleep Nor Wakefulness, But Something Completely New - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxPQTdXYnJsU3VaU1ZkWXJ3NDBncmNKM0ZtUW9fWlBCQTVIbG5TMWxIQnFEUUhZZy1iT1JSeUpBa1p4NUVHTlU1XzhMWVAyTVl5VXNCWUpKc0g4cmpITHBNSHdsMHluVVEwbHJYNVdyZXR4aGp0SmJLclNvNE9TM3huUFpVZktLUXNQZ2VqR0ZtLVRHLXJGTmFWR1hYeGwtRENzcWt4UFVZZnBrNnhMWXNWRDFZYWprYl9DYUVvSDEzdFlEdW1PWUxWSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucid dreaming&lt;/strong&gt;, the phenomenon where dreamers become aware they are dreaming and can influence their dreams, is now recognized as a distinct state of &lt;strong&gt;consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;. Research led by &lt;strong&gt;Çağatay Demirel&lt;/strong&gt; from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands reveals that lucid dreaming is neither &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;wakefulness&lt;/strong&gt; nor typical &lt;strong&gt;REM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, it involves unique &lt;strong&gt;brain wave&lt;/strong&gt; patterns and neural activity that set it apart. This new understanding was published recently in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/45/20/e2237242025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and represents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain Regions and Waves Behind Lucid Awareness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By analyzing an extensive collection of &lt;strong&gt;EEG&lt;/strong&gt; data from multiple studies, Demirel and his team identified &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/drinking-less-of-this-one-beverage-could-lower-your-dementia-risk-and-its-not-coffee/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="88533" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;specific brain regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked to lucid dreaming. The right central lobe, &lt;strong&gt;parietal lobe&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;precuneus&lt;/strong&gt; all showed shifts in electrical activity during lucid dreams. &lt;strong&gt;Beta waves&lt;/strong&gt;—high-frequency brain waves associated with conscious thinking, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/dinosaurs-closest-relatives-prove-they-can-think-study-finds-dumb-birds-are-actually-problem-solvers/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80208" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;problem-solving&lt;/a&gt;, and decision-making—became prominent in the right temporal and parietal lobes. These areas are crucial for spatial awareness, nonverbal memory, and self-perception, explaining why lucid dreamers can recognize they are dreaming and exert cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside beta waves, &lt;strong&gt;gamma waves&lt;/strong&gt;, which are the fastest brain waves, also increased, particularly in the right precuneus. This brain area plays a key role in self-referential thinking—the process of reflecting on oneself. “When lucid dreaming begins, gamma waves increase in the right precuneus,” Demirel said, highlighting this neural signature as a hallmark of conscious awareness within dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Connectivity Patterns Distinguish Lucid Dreaming From REM Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study went beyond localized brain activity to explore&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/mouse-brain-map-compared-to-galaxy/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85804" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the communication between different brain regions—during lucid dreaming. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;alpha band&lt;/strong&gt; connectivity (8–12 Hz) increased significantly during lucid dreaming compared to non-lucid REM sleep. Furthermore, interhemispheric and inter-regional gamma connectivity rose, suggesting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the source level, the right central and parietal areas, including the temporoparietal junction, showed significant reductions in beta power during lucid dreaming. These neural dynamics reflect the complex processes underpinning changes in perception, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/red-meat-may-be-destroying-your-memory/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76105" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, and self-awareness. During initial signaling by lucid dreamers using eye movements, gamma1 power (30–36 Hz) spiked in the right temporo-occipital regions, further illustrating the brain’s dynamic engagement in this unique state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Parallels Between Lucid Dreaming and Psychedelic Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the brain activity observed during lucid dreaming resembles patterns seen with &lt;strong&gt;psychedelic&lt;/strong&gt; drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. Both experiences involve alterations in the precuneus, a region critical to the sense of self and ego processing. However, while psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and reduced self-referential processing, lucid dreaming appears to “harness elements of self-awareness and control,” as noted by Demirel and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This comparison underscores lucid dreaming as an intriguing and complex mode of consciousness. It provides an altered but conscious state in which the dreamer maintains cognitive control and self-awareness, distinguishing it from both typical REM sleep and psychedelic-induced states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Decoding Consciousness Through the Study of Lucid Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming and help establish it as an independent state of consciousness. By pooling&lt;strong&gt; human EEG data&lt;/strong&gt; from multiple labs and applying an adaptive multistage preprocessing pipeline, Demirel’s team overcame previous challenges like small sample sizes and artifacts from eye movements. This rigorous approach allowed them to detect subtle yet distinct neural signatures at both sensor and source levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study advances understanding of how perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control shift during lucid dreaming. As Demirel remarked, “This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

Then, a couple of odd things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When she tried to call her other dog, “I couldn’t speak,” she said. As she walked downstairs to let them into the yard, “I noticed that my right hand wasn’t working.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But she went back to bed, “which was totally stupid,” said Ms. Kramer, now 54, an office manager in Muncie, Ind. “It didn’t register that something major was happening,” especially because, reawakening an hour later, “I was perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So she “just kind of blew it off” and went to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s a common response to the neurological symptoms that signal a T.I.A., a transient ischemic attack or ministroke.

			&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337138/"&gt;60 million people&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to be living with dementia, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths a year and an annual cost to the global healthcare economy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;US $1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; (almost £1 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of scientific research and billions of pounds of investment, dementia still has no cure. But what of the old saying that prevention is better than cure? Is preventing dementia possible? And if so, at what age should we be taking steps to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what many believe, dementia is not simply an unavoidable consequence of ageing or genetics. It is estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;up to 45%&lt;/a&gt; of dementia cases could potentially be prevented by reducing exposure to 14 modifiable risk factors common throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these risk factors – which include things like obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking – are traditionally studied from middle age (around 40 to 60 years old) onwards. As a result, several of the world's leading health bodies and dementia charities now recommend that strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk should &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk"&gt;ideally be targeted at this age&lt;/a&gt; to reap the greatest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;We argue&lt;/a&gt;, however, that targeting even younger ages is likely to provide greater benefits still. But how young are we talking? And why would exposure to risk factors many decades before the symptoms of dementia traditionally appear be important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain, let's work backwards from middle age, starting with the three decades covering adolescence and young adulthood (from ten to 40 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many lifestyle-related dementia risk factors emerge during the teenage years, then persist into adulthood. For example, 80% of adolescents &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26696565/"&gt;living with obesity&lt;/a&gt; will remain this way when they are adults. The same applies to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19455"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01259-9/abstract"&gt;lack of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, virtually all adults who smoke or drink will have &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/uploads/Youth-Smoking-Fact-Sheet.pdf?v=1741882326"&gt;started these unhealthy habits&lt;/a&gt; in or around adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses two potential issues when considering middle age as the best starting point for dementia-prevention strategies. First, altering health behaviour that has already been established is notoriously difficult. And second, most high-risk individuals targeted in middle age will almost certainly have been exposed to the damaging effects of these risk factors for many decades already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the most effective actions are likely to be those aimed at preventing unhealthy behaviour in the first place, rather than attempting to change long-established habits decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The roots of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about even earlier in people's lives? Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;Increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why this may be, it's important to remember that our brain goes through three major periods during our lives – development in early life, a period of relative stability in adult life, and decline (in some functions) in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with that decline in later life. But there is &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.084318"&gt;increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, &lt;a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-7-28"&gt;one of the most important factors&lt;/a&gt; explaining someone's cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11. That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXU8aVHF0gk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;brain scans&lt;/a&gt;, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/148/1/133/7695855"&gt;risk factor exposures in early life&lt;/a&gt; than current unhealthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A lifelong prevention plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we achieve this in practical terms? Complex problems require complex solutions, and there is no quick fix to address this challenge. Many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing an individual's dementia risk – there is no "one size fits all" approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing generally agreed upon is that mass medication of young people is not the answer. Instead, we – along with 33 other leading international researchers in the field of dementia – recently published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;set of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for actions that can be taken at the individual, community and national levels to improve brain health from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our consensus statement and recommendations deliver two clear messages. First, meaningful reductions in dementia risk for as many people as possible will only be achievable through a coordinated approach that brings together healthier environments, better education and smarter public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second – and perhaps most importantly – while it's never too late to take steps to reduce your risk of dementia, it's also never too early to start.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255845/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That trip allowed medical professionals to get to the root of the issue: lung cancer. Now, Gemmell is urging others to err on the side of caution when it comes to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go and see your doctor if you've got anything that you're concerned about – that's what a [doctor] is for," he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/lung-cancer-doctors-say-early-35229827" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Mirror UK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Mirror UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; "Go as soon as you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finger clubbing, or nail clubbing, itself isn't a problem, per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24474-nail-clubbing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It's not painful and on occasion, it can occur without an underlying cause. However, clubbing is most often associated with lung cancer and infections, so it is worthwhile to be examined by a doctor, the clinic's post reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if you have nail clubbing, you can conduct what's called the Schamroth window test, per &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/571916_2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medscape;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt;. Press two fingernails on opposite hands together and hold them up in front of you. If you can't see a sliver (usually a diamond shape) of empty space between your two fingers, there may be cause for concern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of nail&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemmell shared his lung cancer journey in a testimonial for &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization for which he's a staunch advocate. He noted that he had no "common" signs of lung cancer, like breathlessness or restricted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I googled it — as you do — and a respiratory problem flagged up," &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/brian-gemmell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:he wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "I went to my [doctor] and he sent me for a chest x-ray that same day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x-ray technician then sought help from a radiographer, who sent Gemmell for a CT scan — which showed an "advanced tumour in my right lung," he wrote. The medical professionals surrounding Gemmell had differing opinions, but a surgeon insisted on removing his right lung completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemmell praised his doctor for his quick recognition of the symptom's cause, writing that his expertise coupled with his decisiveness "ultimately saved my life." However, awareness is just as crucial, Gemmell wrote, as doctors can only diagnose a problem if it's brought before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People think lung cancer is a death sentence. That’s not surprising with the current survival statistics," Gemmell wrote. "But it doesn’t have to be. I’m proof that it doesn’t have to be. But it’s not going to just happen. The right people have to make it happen. They have to make it a priority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/fingernails-clue-lung-cancer-symptoms-11736846" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 23:33:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBZbzNSZ20xWHJ2VFBFVUthb3JzSExxN051UUNEODJTYTdVeTdGNXVlc3BVZGJQd1E0NGhRNEluTTRUamNQNDN5RGZDMl9GOWQ4eU9pal8xSmNYaWdhQnI3QW5XcVRTbkNZQXFVUzF3SzQ2SEpoR3c</guid></item><item><title>科学家在月经期间发现全脑结构变化- ScienceAlert | Scientists Discovered Structural, Brain-Wide Changes During Menstruation - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNNWNKUjIwVzF6WFdBeHVveWdFeTdlanp6UWhHMGlJTGZsTm4ydW9MSnZTLVhRVUoxUVZGdFBLTmYwRTlxNldWb0VsNEtjbEFPOGZQVkpCVWpjZ19xYW15czZHT0xkQUFpdGdPZzkxOXc5eTZoM2trcWxMQVJLR2ZtOHJHeV9kRDVDTE9pcjFjcUxSenoxcy1OZ3dXTjlLdDFxWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The constant ebb and flow of hormones that guide the menstrual cycle don't just affect reproductive anatomy. They also reshape the brain, and research gives us insight into how this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Elizabeth Rizor and Viktoriya Babenko of the University of California Santa Barbara, a team of researchers tracked 30 women over their menstrual cycles, documenting in detail the structural changes that take place in the brain as hormonal profiles fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, published in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, suggest that structural changes in the brain during menstruation may not be limited to those regions associated with the menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg" alt="menstrual cycle diagram" class="wp-image-142259 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human white matter microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis (HPG-axis) receptor-dense regions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menstruation typically means experiencing some 450 or so periods during the course of a lifetime, so it would be nice to know the different effects they can have on the body, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, although it is something that happens to half the world's population &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/your-menstrual-cycle"&gt;for half their lives&lt;/a&gt;, research has &lt;a href="https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/a-mans-world-how-healthcare-and-research-is-failing-women"&gt;been somewhat lacking&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows why. &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/02/underfunding-of-research-in-womens-health-issues-is.html"&gt;Total mystery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/womens-health-massively-underfunded-and-one-biggest-missed-opportunities-health"&gt;Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the research on the hormonal effect on the brain has been focused on brain communication during cognitive tasks, not the actual structures themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cyclic fluctuations in HPG-axis hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;Rizor, Babenko, and their team noted&lt;/a&gt;. "Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microstructure of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; – the fatty network of neuronal fibers that transfer information between regions of gray matter – has been found to change with hormonal shifts, including puberty, oral contraception use, gender-affirming hormone therapy, and post-menopausal estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg" alt="white matter tracts in the brain" class="wp-image-142255 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White matter tracts connecting regions in the human brain. (Thom Leach/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the menstruation gap in our understanding, the team took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="161227" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans of their subjects during three menstrual phases: menses, ovulation, and mid-&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24417-luteal-phase"&gt;luteal&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of each of these scans, the researchers also measured the participants' hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, as hormones fluctuate, gray and white matter volumes change too, as does the volume of cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, just before ovulation, when the hormones &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"&gt;17β-estradiol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22255-luteinizing-hormone"&gt;luteinizing hormone&lt;/a&gt; rise, the brains of the participants showed white matter changes suggesting faster information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24638-follicle-stimulating-hormone-fsh"&gt;Follicle-stimulating hormone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises before ovulation, and helps stimulate the ovary follicles, was associated with thicker gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24562-progesterone"&gt;Progesterone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises after ovulation, was associated with increased tissue and decreased cerebrospinal fluid volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means for the person driving the brain is unknown, but the research lays the groundwork for future studies, and perhaps understanding the causes of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd"&gt;unusual but severe period-related mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44294-024-00012-4"&gt;A separate study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of scientists found each phase of the menstrual cycle had a distinct influence over the brain as a whole, with changes across the brain and in specific regions found to also be related to an individual's age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although we do not currently report functional consequences or correlates of structural brain changes, our findings may have implications for hormone-driven alterations in behavior and cognition," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Investigation of brain-hormone relationships across networks is necessary to understand human nervous system functioning on a daily basis, during hormone transition periods, and across the human lifespan."&lt;/p&gt;

But scientists didn’t know how the astrocytes communicated with neurons to control this action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110035"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an astrocyte." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research showed that when ATP is released extracellularly, enzymes convert it into adenosine – one of the components of ATP and a known neuromodulator in the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Janelia and Harvard have now deciphered this conversation, revealing how astrocytes trigger a biochemical circuit that regulates neuronal activity and causes the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While neurotransmitters enable fast communication between individual neurons that lasts milliseconds, neuromodulators like the circuit uncovered in the new work act on populations of neurons to tune neuronal signals over timescales that are more than a thousand times slower, enabling flexible behavior on a timescale of seconds to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work helps to uncover how such neuromodulators reach neurons and unveils a significant role for astroglia in neuromodulation. It also highlights the importance of including information about non-neuronal cells in research into how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the prevailing view is that a lot of the computations that are important for behavior come out of the patterns of connectivity between neurons,” says Alex Chen, a joint PhD student in the Ahrens Lab at Janelia and the Engert Lab at Harvard, who led the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work shows that we have to understand biochemical computations and other forms of non-neuronal information and combine it with information about the connections between neurons to really understand what the brain is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neuromodulators flow from astrocytes to neurons could also be important for treating psychiatric conditions, says Janelia Senior Group Leader Misha Ahrens, a senior author on the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Including these pathways more frequently in studies of psychiatric conditions makes a lot of sense,” Ahrens says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that a lot of the neuromodulation underlying brain function and dysfunction flows through astrocytes supports considering this new cell group as a potential therapeutic target.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncovering the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work builds on the previous research from 2019, also led by the Ahrens Lab, which uncovered the role of radial astrocytes in the “giving up” behavior. That research found that as the fish realizes it isn’t getting anywhere, it swims harder, and astroglia activity ramps up. When astroglia activity reaches a threshold, the cells signal neurons in the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that neurons signal astroglia to ramp up their activity by releasing a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, which triggers the astroglia to accumulate internal calcium. But they did not know how the astrocytes communicated back to neurons to cause the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, the team used a variety of sensors to figure out what molecules the astrocytes released when they were activated. They found that when calcium was elevated in astrocytes, ATP was released into the extracellular space between cells. Further, they showed that astrocytes, not neurons, released this ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ATP is widely known to be an energy-carrying molecule that fuels nearly all processes inside cells, it can also act as a signaling molecule on neurons through different types of receptors. However, when the researchers blocked these ATP receptors, they didn’t see any change in the zebrafish’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested that the ATP released from the astroglia was not acting directly on the neurons but was instead broken down. Previous research showed that when ATP is released extracellularly, enzymes convert it into adenosine – one of the components of ATP and a known neuromodulator in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when they blocked adenosine receptors on neurons, the giving up behavior was suppressed. That indicated that the extracellular pathway breaks down ATP into adenosine, which activates receptors on neurons that cause the fish to give up and stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to me because it seems like such an indirect pathway,” Chen says. “First of all, a non-neuronal cell is involved and then, second of all, there’s this biochemical circuit instead of some sort of neuronal circuit that implements this behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think this type of biochemical circuit allows for modulation to happen on a slower time scale, compared to the very fast time scales of neural circuits. The researchers also speculate that the enzymes that break down ATP could play an important role in signal transmission – potentially another target for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/astrocytes-alertness-attention-28939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;companion research&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis shows that neuromodulation by norepinephrine in the hippocampus in mice also flows through astrocytes to influence communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related pathway has been identified in flies, and recently published work has implicated a similar pathway in depressive-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent perspective by HHMI Investigator Cagla Eroglu also discusses these new findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These complementary studies raise the possibility that this pathway could potentially be at work in human brains and play an important role in brain function in both health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This pathway seems to be conserved across flies and fish and mammals, so it might be an evolutionary ancient circuit motif,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ddbfb2b0adb8a4b39db5b5b0b4f3b2afba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Norepinephrine changes behavioral state through astroglial purinergic signaling&lt;/a&gt;” by Alex Chen et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norepinephrine changes behavioral state through astroglial purinergic signaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both neurons and glia communicate through diffusible neuromodulators; however, how neuron-glial interactions in such neuromodulatory networks influence circuit computation and behavior is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 21:53:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE92a09nbmFRWkNkTUp5bTBxbGVxSEw4OVVIc3VUcnk1UXZkdkhvVEt5T0VtMk5rOURPOXJBcHFoUlN3dU5haXY5VW9uSVNoUTA2YUdmUVd2MWhrdERvellRVl9VNkRwazVSN0M4</guid></item><item><title>根据长寿专家的说法，过多的蛋白质实际上会缩短您的寿命-雅虎 | Too Much Protein Could Actually Shorten Your Lifespan, According to Longevity Experts - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDgtMWtPbDNzM2JMVW9WUDZhLTJMODJQdVRBRkpBelRpZVVmQXYzNTFtM1VCSlZRVmFFUVI1eHBNX1FXX0NvQU9qcnhERUNEN2ZlLUxJQXFiRVAyUEJKWXUzX3ZFMk1xemFtdlFMVm54YUZSUTN0TXlEMVRjam10Qm1QMXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overconsumption of animal-based protein raises IGF-1 levels—a growth hormone linked to increased risk of chronic disease, accelerated aging, and reduced cellular repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While IGF-1 is essential in youth and for muscle repair, chronically elevated levels in adulthood can disrupt longevity by promoting cell growth over cellular cleanup (autophagy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts recommend a Mediterranean or flexitarian approach—favoring plant- and fish-based proteins over heavy meat consumption—to reduce IGF-1 and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Protein is an &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/most-nutrient-dense-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:essential nutrient;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; for optimal health. And between the variety of meats, eggs, beans, nuts, and so much more to choose from, there are a lot of options when it comes to sourcing protein. Unfortunately, though, an overconsumption of protein can actually sabotage your longevity efforts, says healthy aging expert Dr. Joseph Antoun. “Consuming excessive protein, particularly from animal sources, raises IGF-1 levels,” he says. “IGF-1, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, is a hormone that plays a crucial role in growth and cell proliferation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But what’s the science behind the negative effects of eating too much protein? How is IGF-1 affected? We asked our longevity experts all the questions—including the best approach to eating the right amount of protein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Does IGF-1 Affect Our Longevity, Exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Excessive IGF-1 is harmful to &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/preventative-health/habits-of-people-who-age-well" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;healthy longevity&lt;/a&gt;, as it promotes cellular growth over repair (increasing the risk of mutations), decreases autophagy (the cellular cleanup process key to healthy aging), and increases risk of chronic diseases,” Dr. Antoun says. Foods that are high in animal protein—such as meat, eggs, and even milk—stimulate and increase our IGF-1 levels, meaning the more you eat, the more you’re at risk of increased IGF-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While it’s essential in childhood and for muscle repair, chronically elevated IGF-1 in adults has been linked to accelerated biological aging, and therefore, an increased risk of age-related conditions,” Dr. Antoun says. “I call this condition the ‘Diabetes of Protein,’ whereby high IGF is excessively aging the body way beyond what the muscles require.” You might notice these lasting impacts on excessively muscular figures, such as body builders, who look great during their peak but tend to age poorly in their 50s and 60s. Much like when you’re a kid, eating &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/type-of-protein-for-longevity-11723511" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:animal-based protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;animal-based protein&lt;/a&gt; in your 20s can feel and seem healthy, Dr. Antoun notes. Around the mid-life period, however, disease formation begins and can slow down the natural processes of our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You might be wondering &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly you can eat to get your recommended daily intake of protein. Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What’s the Best Way to Eat Protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A well-balanced, plant-forward approach, such as a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-live-to-100-8697790" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:longevity-based diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;longevity-based diet&lt;/a&gt; (rich in complex carbs, plant-based/fish-based proteins, and healthy fats from nuts and seeds) offers a far more evidence-based path to metabolic health, disease prevention, and healthspan,” Dr. Antoun says. “When we study centenarians, we notice that most of them follow a plant-based Mediterranean, pescatarian, or flexitarian [semi-vegetarian] diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rather than quitting cold turkey, it’s best to slowly replace animal protein with plant-based protein without completely giving up meat or eggs. For example, you might turn your weekly grilled chicken rotation into a salad, where you’re getting more diverse nutrients than just animal protein. If you tend to eat a specific meat the most, consider replacing it with a plant-based protein like tofu, so you’re still getting the same textural experience while managing your IGF-1 levels. “A pure vegan diet is also correlated with longevity, but it needs to be supplemented with protein—especially at early and late stages of life,” Dr. Antoun adds. Like most things, consumption of animal protein in moderation can be a small change that makes a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/too-much-protein-longevity-11735837" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Real Simple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDgtMWtPbDNzM2JMVW9WUDZhLTJMODJQdVRBRkpBelRpZVVmQXYzNTFtM1VCSlZRVmFFUVI1eHBNX1FXX0NvQU9qcnhERUNEN2ZlLUxJQXFiRVAyUEJKWXUzX3ZFMk1xemFtdlFMVm54YUZSUTN0TXlEMVRjam10Qm1QMXY</guid></item><item><title>脊髓液中的线索可以解锁早期FTD诊断-神经科学新闻 | Clues in Spinal Fluid Could Unlock Early FTD Diagnosis - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5oZEdoYTBQUjRDakNva3hoTENTM1JJbHNfZ2NraldBbkJyR3ZWWHREZ1dLeGdxZG9ZVjR2azNZZlR5eXlqZDR4bWdNNjlVaDFYdzREeVRaQnd4R1Bhb3pwVmVkQktuTDlQdjQ4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a common form of early-onset dementia, is often misdiagnosed due to its overlapping symptoms with psychiatric and neurological disorders. In a new NIH-funded study, researchers identified key protein changes in spinal fluid that may serve as the first specific biomarkers for FTD in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins point to problems in RNA regulation and neural connectivity, both crucial for healthy brain function. By analyzing inherited cases of FTD, researchers hope to develop earlier diagnostic tools that can direct patients into appropriate treatments and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Clues Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 4,000 proteins analyzed revealed changes specific to FTD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered RNA regulation and brain connectivity may drive the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Hope:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could lead to the first biomarkers for diagnosing FTD before symptoms worsen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia usually affects older people, so when it occurs in middle age, it can be hard to recognize. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common form is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is often mistaken for depression, schizophrenia, or Parkinson’s disease before the correct diagnosis is reached. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as part of an NIH-funded study, researchers at UC San Francisco have found some clues about how FTD develops that could lead to new diagnostics and get more patients into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110031"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appear in &lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt; on May 16.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured more than 4,000 proteins found in spinal tap fluid from 116 FTD patients and compared them to those from 39 of their healthy relatives. All 116 patients had inherited forms of FTD, enabling researchers to study the disease in living people with confirmed diagnosis, something that isn’t possible in non-inherited FTD cases, which can only be confirmed after death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composition of the proteins that changed in FTD suggest that these patients have problems with RNA regulation — required for the proper expression of genes in the brain — along with defects that affect connections in their brains. These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FTD affects people in the prime of their lives, stripping them of their independence,” said Rowan Saloner, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there’s no definitive way to diagnose it in living patients, unlike other dementias like Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re able to identify FTD early on, perhaps using some of the proteins we’ve identified, we can direct patients to the right resources, get them into the right therapeutic trials, and, ultimately, we hope, provide them with precision treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients came from the ALLFTD Consortium, which is helmed by study co-authors Adam Boxer, MD, PhD, and Howie Rosen, MD, of UCSF, and Brad Boeve, MD, of the Mayo Clinic. Kaitlin Casaletto, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, is the senior author of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Adam Staffaroni, PhD, Emily Paolillo, PhD, Amy Wise, Hilary Heuer, PhD, Argentina Lario Lago, PhD, Julia Webb, Joel Kramer, PsyD, Bruce Miller, MD, Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD, William Seeley, MD, Salvatore Spina, MD, PhD, Lea Grinberg, MD, PhD, Lawren VandeVrede, MD, PhD, Peter Ljubenkov, MD, Suzan Lee, MD, and Julio Rojas, MD, PhD.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammatory diseases contribute to more than half of deaths worldwide, according to the National Library of Medicine's resource, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;StatPearls&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, about three in five people will die from a chronic illness linked to inflammation, including stroke, respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is a necessary process that occurs in your body to protect you from things like bacteria and viruses, and also helps you heal from injury. But when inflammation becomes long-term and doesn't go away, problems typically follow. Chronic inflammation is linked to conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis and other illnesses. And as the statistics show, it's alarmingly common.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, you have the power to keep inflammation at bay by being proactive with health habits, including how you nourish your body. You may have heard that a good way to do that is to avoid carbs. But nutrition experts disagree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-carbohydrates-and-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Carbohydrates and Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's true that certain carbs can contribute to inflammation, not all carbohydrates are created equal. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Refined carbs&lt;/a&gt;, made with refined white flour, tend to be the main culprits. These include foods like crackers, baked goods, cookies, white breads and pastas. While that doesn't mean you need to take all your favorite treats off the menu (we're not the food police!), it is important to focus on the better-for-you carbs that research shows can actually help &lt;em&gt;lower &lt;/em&gt;inflammation. These include whole grains like buckwheat, oats, quinoa and bulgur, and starchy vegetables like potatoes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2022 systematic review published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8778110/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that replacing refined grains with whole grains can have a significant effect in reducing at least one inflammatory marker. Of the 31 studies the researchers looked at, they noted that the main nutrient in whole grains responsible for their anti-inflammatory benefits was dietary fiber, while other supporting nutrients like phytochemicals, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals also played a role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber is an anti-inflammatory superstar&lt;/a&gt; for many reasons. For starters, it helps keep you fuller longer, which can help support a healthy weight. It also acts as a prebiotic, providing food for your beneficial gut bacteria, which helps them thrive and multiply. And a healthy gut microbiome helps lower inflammation throughout your body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Culinary dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.justwendyjo.com/meet-wendy-jo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wendy Jo Peterson, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of 10 cookbooks, including &lt;em&gt;Bread Making for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;, is an avid supporter of including whole grains in a balanced everyday diet. Peterson, who lives in Germany, says that the bulk of breads in Europe are made from ancient grains, like buckwheat, and contain more fiber than their wheat counterparts commonly found in the U.S. For example, according to the USDA, 100 grams of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2512374/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;buckwheat flour&lt;/a&gt; contains more than three times the fiber of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/790018/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;all-purpose wheat flour&lt;/a&gt; (10 grams versus 3 grams).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peterson notes that this gluten-free seed also contains the phytochemicals rutin and quercetin—antioxidants known to reduce inflammation. A 2021 review published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357186/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infectious Disorders Drug Targets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights the anti-inflammatory benefits of buckwheat alongside its potential neuroprotective, anti-diabetes and anti-hypertensive effects, among others. Antioxidants help protect your body against foreign invaders and the damage they can do to your body over time, which can lead to conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. Regular consumption of foods high in antioxidants can help prevent and also lower inflammation that contributes to disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All good reasons to add buckwheat to your diet. "Start by substituting half of the wheat flour with buckwheat in foods such as pancakes, waffles, crackers and tortillas," says Peterson. "Or, experiment with buckwheat groats as a delicious breakfast porridge."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social media can take even the most humble and help them go viral, which is what happened with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032057/tiktok-high-fiber-scrambled-oats-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;TikTok oat trends&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Oats are an affordable whole grain abundant in the diets of countless cultures. Not only are they shelf-stable and easy to keep on hand, but they make an excellent addition to both sweet and savory dishes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may be familiar with the cholesterol-lowering effects that the beta-glucan fiber present in oats offers. But oats may offer anti-inflammatory effects, too. They contain phenols that reduce free radicals in the body. Over time, these free radicals can lead to inflammation. Unfortunately, you're exposed to them every day, even if you exercise, eat a balanced diet and don't smoke, as they're just a part of life. But diets high in foods containing phenols may combat free radicals—essentially destroying them before they let inflammation set in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2021 study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8625765/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; supports this notion. It found that the phenols in oats not only provide anti-inflammatory properties, but also have potent antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-itching powers, as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A ½-cup serving of cooked oats provides 4 grams of filling fiber for just 150 calories, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2343973/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it also delivers some iron, potassium, magnesium and zinc. You can even pulse whole oats into a flour to use for baking, or use oats in savory dishes, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267654/savory-oatmeal-with-cheddar-collards-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Savory Oatmeal with Cheddar, Collards &amp;amp; Eggs&lt;/a&gt;.

"The purple hue comes from a high concentration of antioxidants, namely phenols, anthocyanins and carotenoids, a trifecta powerhouse that helps rid the body of those free radicals mentioned above. Plus, purple potatoes are a natural source of carbs that provide fiber, vitamins and unique antioxidants."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Step aside, quinoa, there's a lesser-known ancient grain in town that also packs a strong nutritional punch (side note, we still love quinoa too!). "Sorghum is an ancient grain that is naturally gluten-free and contains bioactive compounds that provide anti-inflammatory effects," says Manaker.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a 2021 article published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34441697/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the antioxidants in sorghum, like phenolic acids and flavonoids, fight off those foreign invaders, free radicals, that can cause damage over time, leading to diabetes, inflammation and other health conditions.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spelt is an ancient cousin of wheat that is widely used in German baking, according to Peterson. "It's lower in gluten than wheat flour, but still contains gluten. While spelt is not suitable for those living with celiac disease, people with wheat intolerances can often tolerate spelt," says Peterson. Though it's still important to talk to your healthcare practitioner if you'd like to try spelt and have a wheat intolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spelt is a great way to make every bite count, with a ½ cup of cooked spelt providing 4 grams of fiber and just over 125 calories, according to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169746/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, as Peterson notes, it also contains manganese, vitamin B2, thiamin, niacin and copper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're interested in trying spelt, Peterson recommends purchasing spelt flour or spelt berries to gain the benefits of fiber and nutrients. If you'd like to try spelt berries, they can be cooked and prepared much like farro. If you want to start baking with spelt flour, she recommends starting by swapping in half spelt flour for half of the all-purpose flour in recipes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only do you not have to avoid carbs if you're looking to keep inflammation under control, but eating the right kind of carbs can actually help &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; inflammation. Focus on including a variety of nutrient-rich sources, like buckwheat, oats, purple potatoes, sorghum and spelt, as part of your anti-inflammatory eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;

They cross oceans inside cargo ships, set up vast super-colonies, and push out native species on six continents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-many-ants-live-on-earth-at-any-point-in-time-total-number-is-astounding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nest of ants&lt;/a&gt; settles in, homeowners and farmers often reach for poison baits, yet the insects lose interest before enough of them carry the toxic treat back home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that a tiny splash of caffeine could keep the party going – and give pest managers an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research shows that moderate doses of caffeine sharpen an ant’s memory for the bait’s location. Ants that sipped a caffeinated sugar drop found it again more quickly on later trips, leaving a stronger scent trail for nest-mates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery points to a low-cost tweak that might finally turn the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-perform-life-saving-amputation-surgeries-on-injured-nest-mates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invader’s own teamwork&lt;/a&gt; against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-ant-huge-impact"&gt;Tiny ant, huge impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argentine ant (&lt;em&gt;Linepithema humile&lt;/em&gt;) is only about one-tenth of an inch long, yet its cooperative spirit builds super-colonies stretching thousands of miles along the Mediterranean coast and the U.S. West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those armies displace local insects, rob hummingbird feeders, and even short-circuit electrical gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent economic analyses peg the global cost of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-shifting-to-new-habitats-to-cope-with-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive ants&lt;/a&gt; – including crop losses and control bills – at billions of dollars each year. No wonder pest crews keep searching for smarter tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-giving-caffeine-to-ants"&gt;Giving caffeine to ants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, researchers set up a miniature arena: a Lego drawbridge led each ant onto a letter-size acrylic platform where a single sugar drop waited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drops carried no additive, while others contained 25 parts per million (ppm), 250 ppm, or 2 000 ppm of caffeine. One hundred forty-two ants took part, and each explorer tackled the course four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea with this project was to find some cognitive way of getting the ants to consume more of the poisonous baits we put in the field,” says the study’s first author Henrique Galante, a computational biologist at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Regensburg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated cameras tracked every step, logging travel time and the straightness of each path. Without caffeine, the insects wandered, needing the same span to reach the treat on every attempt. Add a modest stimulant, and the story changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-gives-ant-focus-not-speed"&gt;Caffeine gives ant focus, not speed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that intermediate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-evolution-in-plants-the-surprising-story-of-yerba-mate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;doses of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; actually boost learning – when you give them a bit of caffeine, it pushes them into having straighter paths and being able to reach the reward faster,” Galante explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, ants that tasted 25 ppm caffeine shaved 28 percent off their foraging time on every return. Those on 250 ppm cut the clock by 38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture an individual that spent 300 seconds during its first outing – it would need just 113 seconds after three more trips on the lower dose and 54 seconds on the medium dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-consumption-may-lower-the-risk-of-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The stimulant&lt;/a&gt; did not act like an energy drink. There was no uptick in raw speed. “What we see is that they’re not moving faster, they’re just being more focused on where they’re going,” Galante noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that they know where they want to go, therefore, they have learned the locations of the reward.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only path geometry tightened; pace stayed the same. At the heaviest 2 000 ppm dose – the level that kills half of honeybees in tests – the learning advantage disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharper-trails-deadlier-bait"&gt;Sharper trails, deadlier bait&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentine ants rely on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-now-using-cars-to-travel-spread-to-new-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pheromone highways&lt;/a&gt;. A worker that discovers food drags its stinger along the ground, laying a chemical breadcrumb trail that guides the next shift. Faster relearning multiplies that effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to make them better at finding these baits, because the faster they go and come back to them, the more pheromone trails they lay, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/evolutionary-deja-vu-the-symbiotic-relationships-of-trees-and-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more ants will come&lt;/a&gt;, and, therefore, the faster they will spread the poison in the colony before they realize it’s poison,” Galante continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding caffeine could also slash the waste that now limits bait stations. In neighborhoods and orchards, technicians often replenish gels every few days because the first wave of foragers gives up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A caffeinated lure might stay attractive long enough for queens and larvae to receive a lethal serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is already field-testing the recipe at infested sites in Spain. They also plan to check whether caffeine interacts with common active ingredients such as hydramethylnon or spinosad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lowest dose we used is what you find in natural plants, the intermediate dose is similar to what you would find in some energy drinks, and the highest amount is set to be the LD50 of bees – where half the bees fed this dose die – so it’s likely to be quite toxic for them,” Galante notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting a concentration that boosts memory without harming pollinators will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine’s appeal extends beyond Argentine ants. Other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dirt-ants-were-once-masters-of-disguise-in-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; – including fire ants and big-headed ants – share the same food-sharing habits that make baiting tricky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stimulant nudges their neural circuits in a similar way, managers could deploy a single additive across multiple pest fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-learned-about-ants-and-caffeine"&gt;What we learned about ants and caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, caffeine improves ants’ overall focus and learning without increasing speed, allowing them to navigate straighter paths and lay stronger pheromone trails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect boosts the effectiveness of bait traps, leading more ants to the poison and increasing the chances of it spreading through the colony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the benefit peaks at moderate doses – very high levels eliminate the learning advantage and can be toxic. So, overall, caffeine makes ants better at foraging and sharing, which ironically makes them more vulnerable to well-designed pest control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is simple: a dash of coffee in the buffet may turn an army’s fabled navigation skills against itself.

This therapy may have helped him maintain the ability to speak and recite lines for acting jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear if Fox has received experimental or newer treatments, his foundation has helped &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5323269/Michael-J-Fox-pledges-100-000-UK-university-develop-Parkinson-s-app.html"&gt;fund several of the newest Parkinson's therapies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include a different form of deep brain stimulation called adaptive deep brain stimulation, which adapts electrical impulses in real-time based on symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means it can sense and adjust when a patient's brain activity changes, offering a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adaptive deep brain stimulation was just approved by the FDA for Parkinson's in February and is expected to be widely available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Michael J Fox Foundation has also funded two medications placed under the tongue and inhaled that are meant to 'rescue' Parkinson's patients during 'off' episodes and quickly alleviate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both drugs are currently being reviewed by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:31:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNV20zRTRmWWFLbHMyZWpUVHpTd09mU3p5UWl1a2VxTm1LblZzZVdDMWpHdTZ3NDEwQ3NHaEl5RUc4cG84RV9kMW8zSHQwYW5KdGVnQ29MU1NtdjN3Tl9IT2MxZVdFa3U4aWdaMlAyajlCTVp1cm56ZUsyVkM0dllNRFd0WDdRS215a3BNbktqbUdFSGZzR3EtaFR3SWvSAaIBQVVfeXFMUGdXRkNMQ2J3THRtc0JGN1RZVGRzbG9KelVQQy0tdEh3U3BNV3p1WjkyMm1zcW9WQ1NCTVFSM1NERGhYbERKQjZ5aGZFWVltanhfMThUSHZKUjQ2NTB5N0lFaFNuRXV4TjRXaUx6OWhMWUMteHFFNGJPRFdUVFVBZlFYbDhLM1V5cjRrX1hDa1JyS3BTOG5YcmNSQmpBOS16QVN3</guid></item><item><title>彻底改变肥胖症治疗：科学家发现大脑对抗饥饿的秘密武器- SciTechDaily | Revolutionizing Obesity Treatment: Scientists Discover the Brain’s Secret Weapon Against Hunger - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPc3F4b3I2d3ZUbDhUSkJySDc3c0xtWUs1RWVMVFpmQWdfakd5Q2I4Sk9fT0xzYmoycVExZV8tTkZiNnRjT0djODNfNlh5MXZ4dWNreUNmTVJLd1NvUm56eDM2VnlnNW5xdzVYZlBKNlRQVlhGenAxQU1YVWkwb0FZMHF1dV9fYTdRbjFWTzFwRGtYc2dLTkMyT1pmOHpldVVOSEVPekY1VHo5bWNVejFJRS1Ld1BSeWQ2LWVv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:23:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPc3F4b3I2d3ZUbDhUSkJySDc3c0xtWUs1RWVMVFpmQWdfakd5Q2I4Sk9fT0xzYmoycVExZV8tTkZiNnRjT0djODNfNlh5MXZ4dWNreUNmTVJLd1NvUm56eDM2VnlnNW5xdzVYZlBKNlRQVlhGenAxQU1YVWkwb0FZMHF1dV9fYTdRbjFWTzFwRGtYc2dLTkMyT1pmOHpldVVOSEVPekY1VHo5bWNVejFJRS1Ld1BSeWQ2LWVv</guid></item><item><title>FDA批准首次有助于诊断阿尔茨海默病的血液检测-美联社新闻 | FDA OKs first blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPa0JtV1lNSk82SDg1Sl9rTXpfaktVaUs5YlFuZzlDUFVlOWtZWkp6QWZvYVhEVlZnc0R4UzNULVlJSmYxUzRWOUlsVHM1Rkc3czJod1VXdFd5QU96dGVQZEhsRjF4TWR3cnNPVmFpem9Dd0pZS25RTHlwcmhHVVRMdUh6WUJzZjZYQ21LLVdGOG1LeWNhOHZsZ2xtSXpER3FOWENJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPa0JtV1lNSk82SDg1Sl9rTXpfaktVaUs5YlFuZzlDUFVlOWtZWkp6QWZvYVhEVlZnc0R4UzNULVlJSmYxUzRWOUlsVHM1Rkc3czJod1VXdFd5QU96dGVQZEhsRjF4TWR3cnNPVmFpem9Dd0pZS25RTHlwcmhHVVRMdUh6WUJzZjZYQ21LLVdGOG1LeWNhOHZsZ2xtSXpER3FOWENJ</guid></item><item><title>每天喝茶的黑巧克力可以降低血压和药物治疗-研究发现 | Dark Chocolate With Tea Daily May Lower Blood Pressure As Well As Medication - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1TOGNXaXVWdUVzUjh6eXpBUTZfQVRNa2lYZDZDNzg2OTVWc1hCMDhvLTFORlNIVzB4VkJENDJwendzRzBZQWVKNFlOcGxtX3lHQW9ZZFVMQ3Y0ZlczOWhiZFVCNG91STItSUtuckpzdmI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate, tea, apples, and grapes can significantly lower blood pressure, especially in people with hypertension, with effects comparable in size to standard medications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These flavan-3-ol-rich foods also improve blood vessel function, offering heart health benefits beyond just blood pressure reduction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whole foods work better than supplements, and they come with minimal side effects, making them a safe, affordable addition to a heart-healthy lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUILDFORD, England — &lt;/strong&gt;Instead of buying the next trendy expensive supplement or exotic superfood, a morning cup of tea could do more for your blood pressure than you realize. A new international study suggests that certain foods, like tea and dark chocolate, pack enough cardiovascular punch to rival prescription medications—at least for people who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed 145 clinical trials involving over 5,000 participants and found that foods rich in compounds called flavan-3-ols can slash blood pressure by amounts comparable to many hypertension drugs. In people with high blood pressure, consuming these foods daily dropped their readings by about 6 points systolic (the top number) and 3 points diastolic (the bottom number), similar to what doctors see with standard medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf173/8092214?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, examined foods that most Americans already know and love: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7-health-benefits-dark-chocolate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, tea (both green and black), apples, and grapes. Unlike studies that test isolated compounds in lab settings, this analysis looked at actual foods people can easily incorporate into their daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-teas-for-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood pressure benefits&lt;/a&gt; weren’t the only good news. These foods also improved how well blood vessels function, measured through a test called flow-mediated dilation, which is how well arteries expand when blood flows through them. This effect occurred regardless of blood pressure changes, suggesting that flavan-3-ols might offer cardiovascular protection beyond just lowering the numbers on a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

(George Rudy/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team combed through medical databases for studies published between 1946 and 2024. They included only randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for medical research, that tested flavan-3-ol-rich foods against &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-insomnia-placebos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;placebos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bigger-benefits-for-those-who-need-it-most"&gt;Bigger Benefits for Those Who Need It Most&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trials varied widely in design and duration, from single-dose studies measuring immediate effects to longer trials lasting up to 26 weeks. Participants ranged from healthy volunteers to people with existing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hypertension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. This diversity actually strengthens the findings, showing that benefits appear across different populations and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the effective doses, the average intervention delivered 586 milligrams of total flavan-3-ols daily. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/dark-chocolate-superfood-boosts-mood-memory-immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dark chocolate studies&lt;/a&gt; typically used about 56 grams (roughly two ounces) of chocolate with 75% cocoa content. Tea studies provided around 700 milliliters (about three cups) daily. Apple studies used about 340 grams, roughly two medium apples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that blood pressure benefits were most pronounced in people who needed them most. Those with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/whats-your-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;normal blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; saw minimal changes, but people with elevated readings or diagnosed hypertension experienced significant drops. This mirrors how prescription blood pressure medications work; they’re most effective in people with higher baseline readings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also examined isolated compounds versus whole foods. Studies using purified epicatechin (the main flavan-3-ol in cocoa) or EGCG (common in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/green-tea-may-be-essential-to-conquering-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;) showed weaker effects than studies using actual chocolate or tea. This suggests that the benefits come from the complex interplay of compounds in whole foods, not just single active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flow-mediated dilation improved by about 2% on average. This might sound small, but research has shown that every 1% improvement in this measure corresponds to a 10% reduction in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/periodontitis-gum-disease-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all studies, only 0.4% of participants reported adverse effects, mostly minor &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-tea-for-upset-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach upset&lt;/a&gt; or headaches that resolved on their own. Many medications, on the other hand, often come with significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, the American Heart Association and similar organizations recommend &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/too-much-salt-energy-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limiting sodium&lt;/a&gt;, increasing physical activity, and following dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet to manage blood pressure. Actively including specific flavan-3-ol-rich foods could be equally important, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-addition-to-heart-healthy-lifestyle"&gt;Simple Addition to Heart-Healthy Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers note is that food-based sources may appear safe, but high-dose supplements might interact with medications or cause &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt;. They recommend prioritizing whole foods over supplements, especially for people taking other medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, the news was less encouraging. The analysis found no consistent &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; benefits in studies focusing solely on diabetic participants. People with diabetes might need different approaches or higher doses to see effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/prescription-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prescribed medications&lt;/a&gt; or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation,” says lead study author Christian Heiss from the University of Surrey, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only evidence of the benefits of flavan-3-ols. The massive COSMOS trial, published in 2022, followed over 21,000 people and found that cocoa flavanol supplements reduced &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/multivitamins-supplements-dont-prevent-heart-attacks-stroke-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular death&lt;/a&gt; by 27%. Combined with this new analysis showing comparable blood pressure effects to medications, the case for including these foods in heart-healthy diets becomes increasingly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A daily square of dark chocolate or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/drinking-tea-dementia-alzheimers-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cup of tea&lt;/a&gt; costs far less than most blood pressure medications, which can run hundreds of dollars per month. For the average person, that daily cup of tea or piece of dark chocolate might be one of the easiest and most enjoyable ways to support cardiovascular health. Just remember to choose dark chocolate with at least 75% cocoa content and count those calories as part of your overall diet. Your blood pressure, and your taste buds, will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed for randomized controlled trials published between 1946 and 2024 that examined flavan-3-ol-rich foods’ effects on blood pressure and blood vessel function. They analyzed 109 publications containing 145 separate trials with 5,205 total participants. The studies tested various flavan-3-ol sources including cocoa products, tea, apples, grape extracts, and isolated compounds like epicatechin and EGCG. Interventions ranged from single doses to daily consumption for up to 26 weeks, with participants including healthy individuals and those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daily consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich foods (averaging 586 mg total flavan-3-ols) significantly decreased office blood pressure by 2.8/2.0 mmHg systolic/diastolic overall, with much larger effects in people with elevated blood pressure or hypertension (5.9/2.7 mmHg). 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed similar patterns, dropping 3.7/2.6 mmHg overall and 6.8/5.1 mmHg in hypertensive individuals. Flow-mediated dilation improved by 2.0% after single doses and 1.7% with chronic consumption, independent of blood pressure changes. Effects were strongest with cocoa products and tea, while isolated compounds showed weaker benefits than whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed considerable variability between studies that couldn’t be fully explained by investigated factors, limiting evidence strength to “moderate” quality. Many studies were relatively short-term (average 6.6 weeks), leaving questions about long-term sustainability. Not all studies reported flavan-3-ol content consistently, and measurement methods varied. Only participants with diabetes showed no significant blood pressure benefits. The analysis was limited to English-language studies from PubMed, potentially missing relevant research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Lipton Teas &amp;amp; Infusions. Two co-authors work for food companies (Unilever and Lipton), creating potential conflicts of interest. To address this, independent academic authors validated the analyses and reviewed the manuscript. Additional funding came from British Heart Foundation fellowships for some researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This week, Spotify rushed to remove hundreds of obviously fake podcasts found to be marketing prescription drugs in violation of Spotify's policies and, likely, federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Business Insider (BI) &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-takes-down-podcasts-peddling-drugs-opioids-2025-5"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify removed 200 podcasts advertising the sale of opioids and other drugs, but that wasn't the end of the scandal. Today, CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/tech/spotify-removing-drug-sales-podcasts"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it easily uncovered dozens more fake podcasts peddling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the podcasts may have raised a red flag for a human moderator—with titles like "My Adderall Store" or "Xtrapharma.com" and episodes titled "Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana" or "Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season," CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Spotify's auto-detection did not flag the fake podcasts for removal. Some of them remained up for months, CNN reported, which could create trouble for the music streamer at a time when the US government is cracking down on illegal drug sales online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Multiple teens have died of overdoses from pills bought online," CNN noted, sparking backlash against tech companies. And Donald Trump's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/"&gt;aggressive tariffs&lt;/a&gt; were specifically raised to stop deadly drugs from bombarding the US, which the president declared a national emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BI found that many podcast episodes featured a computerized voice and were under a minute long, while CNN noted some episodes were as short as 10 seconds. Some of them didn't contain any audio at all, BI reported.&lt;/p&gt;

She freaked out and demanded to know who “taught” him to do it, and even wants to send him to a therapist to find out if he was sexually abused by someone. I’ve explained to her that what he did is completely normal for a kid his age; I was masturbating by the time I was 11! However, she is insisting he sees a counselor “just to make sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

Let her know that it is &lt;a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/posts/your-child/masturbation-and-young-children"&gt;normal for children to start playing with their genitals&lt;/a&gt; as early as babyhood, and that by the age of 15, nearly 100 percent of all boys have masturbated. Remind her of your own experiences and explain that a child doesn’t have to have been exposed to anything inappropriate to take an interest in self-pleasure; they literally discover that touching themselves feels good on their own. Try to convince her to apologize to your son for her overreaction, so that he doesn’t feel shame about what he’s done. If she’s unwilling to do that, take him to the side and tell him yourself that she was simply freaked out and wrong. Fight the therapy ideas tooth and nail; if there are some other actual issues about which you think he should talk to someone, then fine. Otherwise, making him go to therapy for masturbating will likely make him think poorly about both therapy and masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmar3ogjl002r3576rgryfgpt@published"&gt;I have an issue with my mother. Whenever I do something wrong and upset her, her first reaction is always to bring up the fact that when I get older, and my parents are dead and I have no one left, I will realize the value of their words. I understand that, and it’s probably true, but the thing that bothers me is her insensitivity. I do not think she realizes how much her words hurt me or maybe she doesn’t care, even though I have explained this to her. When I get upset over what she said, she acts like I am overreacting and that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/worst-fear-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;what I did to make her say that was a terrible offense.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; has identified taurine, a naturally occurring amino acid, as a critical factor in the growth of certain types of leukemia, &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;according to researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Rochester’s Wilmot Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The findings could lead to new treatments for myeloid cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;These aggressive blood cancers all originate in the bone marrow, where the research shows cancer cells depend on taurine from their environment to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Led by Jeevisha Bajaj, Ph.D., the Wilmot team discovered that leukemia cells cannot produce taurine on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Instead, they use a transporter to absorb taurine from the surrounding bone marrow microenvironment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;By using genetic tools to block this uptake in both mouse models and human cell samples, scientists were able to stop leukemia growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,” said Bajaj, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and a member of Wilmot’s Cancer Microenvironment research program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The study adds to growing evidence that metabolism—how cancer cells get energy—is just as important as genetic mutations in driving cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers found that once inside leukemia cells, taurine promotes glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesveld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, urged caution regarding taurine supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid, also found in the brain, heart, and muscles, is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Cancer patients sometimes take it to ease chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“Dr. Bajaj’s work shows that local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia

class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are associated with a rogues' gallery of health problems, including elevated risk for obesity, dementia, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite experts' warnings, ultra-processed foods are satisfying, cheap, and easy, making them popular across much of the world. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316624011258?via%3Dihub"&gt;half of all calories&lt;/a&gt; adults consume at home now come from ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers race to keep up, the list of suspected risks continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an international team of researchers who analyzed decades of records from tens of thousands of health workers, people who eat a lot of ultra-processed foods are more likely to have early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not prove causation, but it does reveal a noteworthy association, especially in the broader context of health concerns related to ultra-processed foods. It also adds to mounting evidence that diet is key to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eating a healthy diet is crucial as it has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and the dietary choices we make today can significantly influence our brain health in the future," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Xiang Gao, a nutritional epidemiologist with the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers focused on signs of Parkinson's disease that appear before more specific symptoms develop, which can include body pain, constipation, depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, and an impaired sense of smell. &lt;span&gt;At this stage, while patients may not have characteristic features of the disease, neurodegeneration may have already begun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's growing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinson's disease. Our research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinson's disease," Gao &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, letting them track details about the diet and health of nearly 43,000 people for up to 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample included men and women with an average age of 48 years, who had no history of Parkinson's disease. The subjects had received regular medical exams and completed biennial health questionnaires, which Gao and his colleagues reviewed for early signs of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects also submitted responses to surveys at two- to four-year intervals, offering insight into their dietary habits. Researchers used this to estimate each subject's average daily ingestion of ultra-processed foods, as defined by the Nova classification system for food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study covered several types of ultra-processed foods, including sauces, spreads, or condiments; artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; packaged savory snacks; packaged sweets; snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; and animal-based products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161680" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg" alt="a bowl of Froot Loops breakfast cereal, a common example of ultra-processed foods" class="size-full wp-image-161680" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl-542x415.jpg 542w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161680" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg"&gt;Evan-Amos/Wikimedia Commons/CC0 1.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects were split into five groups based on their consumption of ultra-processed foods. Those in the highest group ate 11 or more servings per day on average, while the lowest group averaged fewer than three daily servings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers adjusted for factors such as age, alcohol intake, body mass index,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; intake, physical activity, and tobacco smoking, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects who ate 11 or more daily servings of ultra-processed foods were 2.5 times likelier to have at least three early signs of Parkinson's disease compared with subjects who ate fewer than three servings per day, the authors report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was linked with increased risk of almost all early signs of Parkinson's disease used in this study, they found, with the exception of constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some important caveats to these findings. They show an association between ultra-processed foods and increased risk for early signs of Parkinson's disease, but more research is needed to clarify the nature of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on early signs of Parkinson's disease also involves some ambiguity, as the authors acknowledge, since these are potential hints of the condition rather than definitive indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the early signs – body pain, for example, or daytime sleepiness – are common as people age and don't necessarily herald Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these features considered in composite, however, are "strongly predictive" of subsequent Parkinson's disease diagnoses, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Choosing to eat fewer processed foods and more whole, nutritious foods could be a good strategy for maintaining brain health," Gao &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More studies are needed to confirm our finding that eating less processed food may slow down the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Rabies can also be found in other wild animals, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a preventable disease that can be fatal if not treated properly,” said Alpesh Patel, Chief Epidemiologist for the Will County Health Department. “Bats are often the most common carrier of rabies. We want our residents to be informed of the potential dangers of rabid animals and stay away from bats and any wild or unfamiliar animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous system. Rabies can spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies can also be contracted when saliva from a rabid animal comes into contact with a person’s eyes, nose, mouth, or an open wound. If someone wakes up to find a bat in the room, that is also considered an exposure even if they cannot identify a bite. A bat’s teeth are small, and a bite mark may not be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover a bat in your home, do not kill or release the bat. Instead, immediately consult with your local animal control to determine appropriate next steps. If you have been bitten by a bat or any wild animal, seek immediate medical attention. Animal bites may also become infected with bacteria. Rabies preventive treatment, if needed, must begin within a few days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An animal does not have to be aggressive or exhibit other symptoms to have rabies. Changes in any animal’s normal behavior can be early signs of rabies. A bat that is active during the day, found on the ground, or is unable to fly is more likely than others to be rabid. Such bats are often easily approached but should never be handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health offers the following tips can help prevent the spread of rabies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not touch, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick wild animals to health. Call animal control or an animal rescue agency for assistance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. “Love your own, leave other animals alone” is a good principle for children to learn to reduce the risk of exposures to rabid animals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain homes and other buildings so bats cannot get inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a bat is in your home, do not release the bat outdoors until after speaking with animal control or public health officials. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After consulting with animal control or public health officials, the bat may need to be captured for rabies testing to determine if you need preventive treatment or if your pet may have been exposed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steps you can take to capture the bat if animal control is not available:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the bat lands, approach it slowly, while wearing thick gloves, and place a box or coffee can over it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide a piece of cardboard under the container to trap the bat inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tape the cardboard to the container securely, and punch small holes in the cardboard, allowing the bat to breathe and call animal control. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can find more information about rabies and how to prevent exposure at the Illinois Department of Public Health website: &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747505099294000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1lzylfHPyePqvr4huA_wu5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rabies (illinois.gov)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 18:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTmtOOWlwQzFEWGZhN2U1RVppYzBva2l5VU1wYmJFY3RxMmJUVGh0dGU0WERKa3hpazFiUHBEMEhYX0hYX2llWkMxaW5FRy15bjg4cER1TmUyZnBMTmV5dVNocVVnWU5kR2F1ZHJJcnF3d1Vsb25WYV8wOEprZ1VwSTNOek14bEJWSjBfbjRn0gGnAUFVX3lxTE93Qi1jOThvQkktY1E5cUQ4STZkZ0JiRk4wUDFlb1Y5akNDbGVVZTNCc1ZpOElyeUxCLXU0Z3ExelFQZDlfaUYwanVSRGlkY1lBRUVydzRidGpKTlkyZ0g5ZTdzZ015XzZ4OFduYy1QYUpLN28zaXYtbXdEbm53bEtwbmFhaWlMZWdJYlJ5UXFrM243Ynp0LTlCUmo1cFpTSEd6aGNyYk00</guid></item><item><title>新的研究指出，肠道5-羟色胺是治疗抑郁和焦虑的潜在方法- PsyPost | New research points to gut serotonin as a potential way to treat depression and anxiety - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPcXBnS0gyaGxEZ2UxaVJrcDRUcV84UDZoSTQzWk5Yak04YkdMMktiU19KWE51RVpQT1BxdjAxU28zOElnRnBKY211aGRVM3NVb3FBMlpYMk50ZDZtVkl6cmFsdDhiQWwwOUtWYmQtaVJmWVdyLTBCSURWTWVZVUVqNmlUempwRHhBeTBCOHB1Tmc3b3RFdzFUaFpSb0M2X0RuYk93QlRmWXUwUlQ5dXNYRUx3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.11.012" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that serotonin in the gut lining may play a key role in regulating mood—and could open the door to safer antidepressant treatments, especially for pregnant women. In a series of experiments with mice and a large human birth cohort, researchers found that increasing serotonin in the intestinal lining reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. But they also discovered that exposing developing babies to serotonin-targeting antidepressants in utero was linked to a much higher risk of constipation in early life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Mark Ansorge at Columbia University and Kara Margolis at New York University, was motivated by a longstanding puzzle in mental health care. While drugs like Prozac and Zoloft are widely used and effective for many people with anxiety and depression, they can cause unwanted side effects—especially gastrointestinal issues. And when used during pregnancy, they cross the placenta and affect fetal brain and gut development. Despite this, exactly where in the body these medications work to improve mood has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the gut might be a key player in the antidepressant response, the researchers used genetic techniques to delete a specific serotonin transporter protein (SERT) only in the intestinal lining of mice. This transporter is responsible for clearing serotonin, a chemical that helps regulate mood, from the space between cells. Removing the transporter boosts serotonin levels in the gut. The team created two groups of mice: one with SERT removed from birth, and another where SERT was deleted only in adulthood using an inducible system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then put these mice through a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, including how much time they spent exploring new environments, their willingness to eat in unfamiliar situations, and how much time they spent immobile when suspended by the tail—a common sign of despair in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice lacking intestinal SERT, whether from birth or adulthood, showed less anxious and less depressive behaviors. They explored more, showed fewer signs of hesitation, and were more active than control mice. Importantly, this mood-improving effect depended on communication between the gut and brain. When the researchers surgically disrupted the vagus nerve—the main information highway between the gut and brain—the benefits disappeared. This suggested that serotonin in the gut lining influences mood by sending signals to the brain via the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the researchers wanted to understand whether reducing serotonin in the gut might have the opposite effect. In another set of experiments, they used genetically modified mice that couldn’t make serotonin in the gut and also tested a drug that blocks serotonin production without being absorbed into the bloodstream. In both cases, the animals showed more anxiety-like behavior. This further confirmed the role of gut serotonin in regulating mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, targeting serotonin in the gut did not appear to harm cognition or gut motility, which are often affected by systemic antidepressant use. The researchers found no major changes in learning and memory tests, and gut function remained mostly normal—though there were subtle changes in the speed of intestinal movements when the transporter was deleted from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human part of the study involved over 400 mother-child pairs enrolled in a Canadian birth cohort. The researchers followed up with mothers who either used antidepressants during pregnancy, experienced depression without medication, or had no mental health issues. They found that babies exposed to antidepressants in the womb were about three times more likely to develop functional constipation in their first year of life compared to babies who were not exposed. Constipation is a common type of gut-brain interaction disorder, and the finding adds to concerns about how these drugs may affect the developing gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results are consistent with earlier animal studies showing that systemic serotonin blockers can lead to abnormal development of the nervous system in both the brain and the gut. By focusing on the gut lining specifically, the new study offers a potential workaround: targeting serotonin only in the intestine may relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety without causing unwanted side effects or affecting fetal development during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft that raise serotonin levels are important first-line treatments and help many patients but can sometimes cause side effects that patients can’t tolerate. Our study suggests that restricting the drugs to interact only with intestinal cells could avoid these issues,” said Ansorge, an associate professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, the authors stress that pregnant individuals should not stop taking prescribed antidepressants without consulting a doctor. Untreated depression and anxiety can pose serious risks to both the mother and child. Instead, the researchers hope their findings will lead to new antidepressant medications that work only in the gut and avoid entering the bloodstream—especially during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larissa Takser, a pediatrician and co-author based in Quebec, noted the implications: “At the age of one, 63% of children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy experienced constipation, compared with 31% of children whose mothers did not take medication. This finding suggests a potential connection between serotonin levels in utero and gut development, and opens new doors to examine SSRI properties not previously studied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are already working on next-generation antidepressants that would be delivered in a way that keeps the drug in the intestine, reducing systemic exposure. “Our findings indicate that we may be able to treat a mother’s depression or anxiety effectively without exposing the child,” Ansorge said, “and we are working on drug delivery technology that will hopefully help us achieve that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margolis emphasized that the study is not intended to change clinical practice today. Instead, it is a call for more research on how antidepressants affect the gut, especially during development. “These are not clinical guidelines,” she said. “Rather, they are a call that more research is needed on the connection between SSRIs, serotonin, and the gut. It’s recommended that mothers and providers together consider treatment options that have been shown to be successful, including medications and cognitive behavioral therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research adds to growing interest in the gut-brain connection—a field that has revealed how gut bacteria, immune signals, and hormones interact with the nervous system. The idea that mood can be regulated from the gut opens new opportunities to improve mental health with fewer risks. If future clinical trials confirm these findings, we may see a new class of antidepressants designed to work where most of the body’s serotonin is made—not in the brain, but in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.11.012" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Intestinal epithelial serotonin as a novel target for treating disorders of gut-brain interaction and mood&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Lin Y.

              &lt;p&gt;The grim reaper can sometimes take decades to catch up with its victims. In a report out this week, scientists describe a woman who died from an incurable prion disease caught roughly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors detailed the unusual case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 58-year-old woman developed a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) likely contracted through contaminated human growth hormone (HGH) treatments she received as a child, they determined. The tragic death may represent the longest latency period ever documented for this universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disease-causing prions are one of the strangest things that can sicken people. They’re the misfolded form of the normal (but still very mysterious) prion protein found in our bodies and brains. When a rogue prion comes across its harmless counterpart, it converts the latter into a misfolded copy of itself, much like a zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, the exponential accumulation of bad prions destroys the brain, leading to symptoms like dementia and death soon after. If that’s not scary enough, prions are naturally resistant to most standard methods of sterilization used to kill off other infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The one saving grace is that prion diseases in general remain very rare, though other prion-like diseases like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alzheimers-disease-transmissable-human-growth-hormone-1851206087"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prions can emerge sporadically for no clear reason, can be caused by inherited mutations, or they can be transmitted though close contact with infected bodily fluids or brain matter. In the 1980s, for instance, doctors discovered that people could catch CJD through human growth hormone extracted from prion-infected cadavers. A decade later, we learned that people could also catch CJD via tainted beef from cows infected with their own version of prion disease (nicknamed mad cow disease).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery of HGH-related CJD quickly led to the end of cadaver-sourced HGH in the U.S. and other countries (thankfully, synthetic HGH became available soon after). Still, over two hundred cases of iatrogenic CJD—iatrogenic meaning it was caused by a medical treatment—from tainted HGH have been documented worldwide. Most of these cases were reported between five and 10 years after people had used HGH. But prion disease can sometimes take much longer to manifest in certain people, even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to this latest report, the woman first visited doctors with tremors and trouble balancing. As is often the case, once symptoms started, her condition rapidly worsened. She was hospitalized just four weeks later, and several days into her stay, she fell into a coma that she would never awaken from.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An autopsy confirmed the woman’s death from CJD but ruled out known genetic causes. And since she received HGH treatment prior to the cadaver ban, it was likely the root source of her illness, the doctors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HGH is used to treat severe growth-related conditions in children, and is typically taken over many years, including in this case. That makes it impossible to know exactly when the woman contracted CJD. Her first treatment was 51.3 years prior to her symptoms appearing, for instance, while her last treatment was 42.1 years earlier. But the U.S. switched to a different method of collecting HGH from cadavers in 1977, one that inadvertently and greatly reduced the risk of prion contamination. Based on that, the most likely timeframe for her infection is around 48.3 years earlier, the authors calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are known cases of people dying from CJD infections caught over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prion-disease-can-lurk-in-your-brain-for-30-years-befor-1823628617"&gt;30 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(06)68930-7/abstract"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of other prion diseases emerging over a half century later. But this appears to be the longest case of HGH-related CJD documented so far, though it might not be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that genetics can influence a person’s chances of developing prion disease. And the woman possessed a mutation in the gene that codes for the prion protein linked to longer latency periods. So while tainted human growth hormone hasn’t caused CJD for a very long time, some people out there may still one day succumb to their earlier exposure (it’s estimated that around 7,700 people in the U.S. took HGH prior to the cadaver ban).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors say that doctors treating neurological illness should at least be on the lookout for these delayed cases, especially if their patients have a history of HGH treatment before 1977.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although the US iCJD outbreak has slowed substantially, the potential for new cases remains,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the boy's fourth month, researchers were meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory approval for a clinical trial—a trial where KJ would be the only participant. They were also working with the institutional review board (IRB) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to go over the clinical protocol, safety, and ethical aspects of the treatment. The researchers described the unprecedented speed of the oversight steps as being "through alternative procedures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In month five, they started toxicology testing in mice. In the mice, the experimental therapy corrected KJ's mutation, replacing the errant A-T base pair with the correct G-C pair in the animals' cells. The first dose provided a 42 percent whole-liver corrective rate in the animals. At the start of KJ's sixth month, the researchers had results from safety testing in monkeys: Their customized base-editing therapy, delivered as mRNA via a lipid nanoparticle, did not produce any toxic effects in the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical-grade batch of the treatment was readied. In month seven, further testing of the treatment found acceptably low-levels of off-target genetic changes. The researchers submitted the FDA paperwork for approval of an "investigational new drug," or IND, for KJ. The FDA approved it in a week. The researchers then started KJ on an immune-suppressing treatment to make sure his immune system wouldn't react to the gene-editing therapy. Then, when KJ was still just 6 months old, he got a first low dose of his custom gene-editing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Transformational”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the treatment, he was able to start eating more protein, which would have otherwise caused his ammonia levels to skyrocket. But he couldn’t be weaned off of the drug treatment used to keep his ammonia levels down (nitrogen scavenging medication). With no safety concerns seen after the first dose, KJ has since gotten two more doses of the gene therapy and is now on reduced nitrogen scavenging medication. With more protein in his diet, he has moved from the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile in weight to 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile. He's now about 9 and a half months old, and his doctors are preparing to allow him to go home from the hospital for the first time. Though he will have to be closely monitored and may still at some point need a liver transplant, his family and doctors are celebrating the improvements so far.&lt;/p&gt;

Fight me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his fiery post, the sci-fi star declared that the scientists in charge of astronomical research were 'just a bunch of corrupt nerds on a power trip' and said it was time for Trump to end their 'tyranny of the cosmos.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shatner spent Thursday night sparring with fans on X and suggested that Trump should step in make Pluto a planet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He even called on Musk, the so-called 'first buddy,' to convince Trump to sign an executive order giving Pluto back its status in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a surprising turn for the actor, who recently criticized Trump for his continued attempts to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14685859/William-Shatner-Trump-Canada.html"&gt;purchase his home country&lt;/a&gt; of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent interview with Bill Maher, the Shatner was baffled by the results of the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't know why Democrats lost.

    &lt;/p&gt;
       

  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,” &lt;strong&gt;said FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Knowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder known to slowly destroy memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, is progressive, meaning that the disease gets worse over time. In most people with Alzheimer’s disease, clinical symptoms first appear later in life. Amyloid plaques in a patient’s brain are a hallmark sign of Alzheimer’s disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient’s symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. Similar FDA-authorized/cleared tests, one from the same company as this new test, are used with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which are collected through an invasive lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. This new Lumipulse test only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million,” &lt;strong&gt;said Center for Devices and Radiological Health Director Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt; “Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this clinical study, 91.7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and 97.3 % of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks associated with the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio are mainly the possibility of false positive and false negative test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positive results, in conjunction with other clinical information, could lead to an inappropriate diagnosis of, and unnecessary treatment for, Alzheimer’s disease. This could lead to psychological distress, delay in receiving a correct diagnosis as well as expense and the risk for side effects from unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA reviewed the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio through the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-and-clearances/510k-clearances"&gt;510(k) premarket notification pathway&lt;/a&gt;. A 510(k) notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA found that the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is substantially equivalent to the Lumipulse G β-amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40), which is the previously authorized test that uses CSF samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio was granted &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program"&gt;Breakthrough Device&lt;/a&gt; designation, a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA issued clearance of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio to Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

The most common was polyethylene, a material widely used in packaging and containers such as bottles and cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, the brain tissue contained about 4,800 micrograms of microplastic per gram —roughly equivalent to the weight of a plastic spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered clusters of sharp plastic shards measuring 200 nanometers or smaller—not much larger than some viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water.

The most common was polyethylene, a material widely used in packaging and containers such as bottles and cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, the brain tissue contained about 4,800 micrograms of microplastic per gram —roughly equivalent to the weight of a plastic spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered clusters of sharp plastic shards measuring 200 nanometers or smaller—not much larger than some viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It mainly affects the lungs and can also cause damage to the brain, spinal cord and lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is transmitted through the air when infected people cough or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease — around 2million annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 80 percent of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries in South East Asia, Africa and the Western Pacific region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 10,000 Americans were diagnosed with the infection and 565 died in 2024, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, have a higher risk of falling ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB cases have been &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12603141/New-York-tuberculosis-Covid-migrant.html"&gt;increasing both globally and in the US due to higher international travel and migration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, Oregon reported 87 cases of TB according to the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a 16.7 percent increase compared to 2023, and the second consecutive year of increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older people and those with weak immune systems are most at risk of contracting TB - leading to permanent lung damage, even after successful treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB is mostly spread through an exchange of germs containing the bacteria through the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of active TB in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks and signs can include coughing up blood or mucus, chest pains, pain with breathing or coughing, fever, chills and night sweats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a fatal illness caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and mainly affects the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/article-8509655/BCG-DOES-protect-against-Covid-19-study-confirms.html"&gt;protect themselves against TB by getting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, but it is not generally not on the vaccination schedule in the US due to the low risk of infection.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If infected, patients are asked to remain isolated and must take antibiotics for six months to treat TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people become infected with TB germs that live in the body for years without causing illness. This is known as inactive TB or latent TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However without treatment, one in 10 people with inactive TB will get sick with active TB disease, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This impaired threat-safety discrimination was associated with a tendency to overgeneralize their fear responses. The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14092"&gt;Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood adversity includes a range of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as abuse, neglect, household dysfunction, and exposure to violence. It is associated with disruptions in brain development, particularly in regions involved in emotional regulation and stress response, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Chronic exposure to adversity can alter the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in heightened physiological reactivity to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who face such adversity are at increased risk for developing mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. They may also experience difficulties with emotion regulation, social functioning, and cognitive performance. In adulthood, early adversity is linked to poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, substance use disorders, and chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Celine Samaey and her colleagues aimed to investigate how childhood adversity influences fear learning during adolescence—specifically, whether adolescents who had experienced adversity would show impairments in distinguishing safe from threatening cues and a greater tendency to generalize fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 119 adolescents between 12 and 16 years old, with an average age of 14. Sixty-five participants were girls, and 63 had been exposed to childhood adversity, as assessed by the abbreviated Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire – 2nd Revision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed two key experimental tasks. In a fear conditioning task, they viewed circles of different sizes. One specific circle (designated CS+) was occasionally followed by a mild electric shock to the wrist, while another (CS–) was never followed by a shock. After learning this association, participants were shown additional circles of varying sizes and asked to rate how likely they thought it was that each circle would be followed by a shock. This allowed researchers to assess how broadly participants generalized fear to stimuli that resembled the threatening one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a perceptual discrimination task, where they had to judge whether pairs of circles were the same or different in size. This test was used to determine whether generalization of fear might be due to difficulty distinguishing the visual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fear conditioning task progressed, participants generally became more likely to expect an electric shock. Girls reported lower shock expectancy overall compared to boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, adolescents with greater exposure to childhood adversity were more likely to expect shocks, even for stimuli that were not followed by shocks. Boys who had experienced adversity gave higher threat ratings to the safe circle and to other generalization stimuli than boys without such experiences. Girls exposed to adversity showed elevated threat expectations for nearly all stimuli except the most extreme generalization stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern suggests that adolescents who experienced childhood adversity were more prone to generalizing fear and had a reduced ability to distinguish between threatening and safe cues. Interestingly, those exposed to adversity were not worse at visually distinguishing the circles—in fact, they tended to perform better in the perceptual discrimination task. This indicates that their increased fear generalization was not due to perceptual confusion but rather to differences in emotional learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study showed that CA [childhood adversity] is associated with reduced threat-safety discrimination and increased fear generalization during adolescence. As such, altered fear learning emerges as an important process through which adversity increases risk for the development of psychopathology,” the,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between childhood adversity experiences and fear learning. However, it should be noted that the study used a very mild electric shock as the object of fear. The patterns of learning to respond to serious threats or dangers might not be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14092"&gt;Childhood adversity is associated with reduced threat-safety discrimination and increased fear generalization in 12- to 16-year-olds,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Celine Samaey, Aleksandra Lecei, Maarten Jackers, Lise Jennen, Koen Schruers, Bram Vervliet, Bart Boets, and Ruud van Winkel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 16:19:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOWlFxUFRjLUx1UU5YUkk5TmV5WG5UMjRCeThyZlRkZU5Ga3NsektNQ0p5eXZfamg3ZDRwcWdkeV96SnItRzNwNUZUVXlmMDJCblhZeWdGLW9ySHAtaHJEeFpGTXlzd1lsTXpsLXFsV0t4YXU5NzNhdFY4cld1N0JSVDhsQjh1YlZxaG5GSUoxTDhFbW5YMS1kcGVzSHFpWENZdDBONVVxZFRNQk5qSk16cVo4b0ZQdw</guid></item><item><title>专家确定可能增加痴呆风险的睡眠小时数- dailymail.co.uk | Experts pinpoint number of hours of sleep that could raise risk of dementia - dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxON3Zmc2EwMUZITWVmRmtIc1dGUElqSEZtX2tZSjVrZzBBM1FTMlJPNGFvUmJ2b3dsbkNnb2s0TlZsNktkbXQtV1FPdjR1SGNuRE9GY2haNk5GZ1dDTzIzUEEyeGYtdElyQjl6RHB4TEFZMFpPWFpQUFZqNllySGdBeXdiTERQM2PSAYwBQVVfeXFMTlRyZUZuaHNwWHc5UUo5WE85eUN5UTFxOGt2ZS12MURFSHkwWGxWb0RIQnh1TXRDMlM5aUJ2eWhsTjVsZEJZVnptLWV2b2pSckF1Q3NqLVN2bFdwbm5MZmNkcEE4clVkN3YtbWFHZm1KM1QtT1NxM25YSUh4elNxRGlGV1BYMVhmNGh6Nmw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's well known that not getting enough sleep can increase dementia risk, but scientists have now discovered that too much shut eye could be just as harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have found that sleeping an average of nine hours a night can fuel brain ageing that lead to memory problems in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by scientists at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-4048ef20-3266-11f0-ab01-8d81f2514159"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Health Science Centre, found that this amount of sleep added an average of six and a half years to the age of participants' brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings they concluded that 'long sleep duration' could be 'an early and potentially reversible' risk factor for the memory-robbing disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed &lt;span&gt;1,853 healthy adults aged 27-85, and studied how their sleep duration affected cognitive abilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants' cognitive function was assessed every four years using gold standard measurements of memory, verbal reasoning, visual-spatial awareness and reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants also completed a survey every four years, detailing the number of hours they typically slept each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results showed that, on average, those who slept for nine or more hours per night over the course of the two decade study performed significantly worse in all four cognitive tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Disturbances in sleep duration have been linked to an increased risk of cognitive defects and Alzheimer's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the poorest results were seen in people who showed depressive symptoms, and had nine or more hours sleep a night, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mood disorder is known to trigger patterns of excessive sleep, and the experts pose that depression, rather than sleep itself, may be driving the cognitive decline in these patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, its not just those who suffer from low mood that are at risk from too much rest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who showed no signs of depression, but slept for more than nine hours a night, experienced decreased cognitive function, struggling with global cognition and visual reproduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns contribute to an increased risk of cognitive deficits and Alzheimer's disease', Prof Young explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings echo that of previous studies, including one 10-year-long report, published in the Psychiatry Research journal, that found sleeping for more than eight hours a night, on average, was linked with an alarming 64 per cent increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst experts are not entirely sure why excess shut eye could contribute to dementia, one Swedish &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0065"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0043"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;said it is also possible that brain damage caused by early dementia could be fueling a need for excess sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="72" data-end="601"&gt;A new long-term study is challenging decades of diet discourse around carbohydrates—this time, not with warnings of weight gain or blood sugar spikes, but with data connecting high-quality carb consumption to healthy aging. Published in &lt;em data-start="316" data-end="335"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834202?guestAccessKey=d876a1c9-c298-43d8-8354-2befe857fad9&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=051625" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; tracked more than 47,000 women over three decades, revealing that those who consumed &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/plant-based-foods-most-fiber" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;more dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; and carbohydrates from whole plant foods in midlife had a significantly higher chance of aging healthfully into their 70s, 80s, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Researchers from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from the renowned Nurses’ Health Study, which began in 1976 and remains one of the largest and longest-running studies on women’s health. Using food-frequency questionnaires gathered every four years from 1984 through 2016, the researchers focused on dietary intake in midlife—specifically carbohydrates—and cross-referenced that with health outcomes in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Quality carbs equal longer life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;“We’ve all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy, or blood sugar levels. But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later,” Andres Ardisson Korat, scientist at the HNRCA and lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="credit" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjUwMjEyLzMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMzYweCIseyJmb3JtYXQiOm51bGx9XSxbInAiLCJvcHRpbWl6ZSJdXQ/3.jpg?sha=81eb8a9566a18f58" alt="older woman grocery shopping"&gt;Canva&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1591" data-end="2086"&gt;Healthy aging, as defined by the study, included living without major chronic illness, retaining strong cognitive and physical function, and maintaining good mental health. Of the participants analyzed—who were between the ages of 70 and 93 in 2016—just 3,706 met this definition. But among those who consumed more unrefined carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, as well as more dietary fiber overall, the odds of reaching older age in good health rose substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2088" data-end="2438"&gt;Specifically, the researchers found that high midlife intakes of dietary fiber and high-quality carbohydrates were linked to a six to 37 percent greater likelihood of &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/food-lessons-oldest-people-blue-zones" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in refined carbohydrates and starchy vegetables—such as white potatoes—were associated with 13 percent lower odds of aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;“Our results are consistent with other evidence linking consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes with lower risks of chronic diseases, and now we see the association with physical and cognitive function outcomes,” said Qi Sun, associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;Fiber and healthier aging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2796" data-end="3410"&gt;The implications are particularly meaningful in the context of rising life expectancy and increased interest in how to extend not just lifespan, but healthspan—the number of years lived in good health. According to data from the World Health Organization, global average life expectancy has increased by more than six years since 2000, reaching 73.4 years in 2019. But the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy remains significant. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that while life expectancy is around 77 years, only about 68 of those are spent in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3412" data-end="3553"&gt;Against that backdrop, this new study strengthens the case for fiber-rich, plant-based diets in supporting both longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;The research builds on a growing body of evidence that prioritizes not just what people eat, but when. “Studies are starting to find an association between food choices in midlife and quality of life in later years,” said Ardisson Korat. “The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/recipes/beans-marbella-with-salty-roasted-potatoes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjMyMTg3L1ZlZ05ld3MuQmVhbnNNYXJiZWxsYS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEzNjB4Iix7ImZvcm1hdCI6bnVsbH1dLFsicCIsIm9wdGltaXplIl1d/VegNews.BeansMarbella.jpg?sha=98dcdf2aff3af823" alt="VegNews.BeansMarbella"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3904" data-end="4194"&gt;Past studies have already linked plant-based diets to a reduced risk of chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. But this is one of the first large-scale studies to analyze how carbohydrate intake during midlife relates directly to overall aging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;Still, the authors caution that the findings have limitations. The study population consisted mostly of white female nurses, which may not reflect the experiences of more diverse populations. Additional research is needed to determine whether the associations hold across racial, socioeconomic, and gender lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;And while the findings offer compelling associations, they do not confirm causality. More research is required to explore the specific biological mechanisms at play—particularly how fiber and carbohydrate quality influence inflammation, &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/vegan-gut-health-recipes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, and cellular aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;Diets for an aging population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4790" data-end="5266"&gt;The study was supported by the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service through a cooperative agreement, as well as by the National Institutes of Health. The Nurses’ Health Study, which began tracking 121,700 nurses in 1976, has been instrumental in shaping dietary guidelines and public health policies for nearly five decades. Its comprehensive datasets allow researchers to track long-term trends across a wide array of lifestyle and health variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="5268" data-end="5642"&gt;With interest in healthy aging and longevity booming—particularly among aging Gen Xers and Millennials now entering midlife—these findings add new urgency to rethinking the role of carbohydrates in the diet. While low-carb trends such as keto and paleo continue to dominate consumer markets, studies like this one are helping to clarify that not all carbs are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="5644" data-end="5812"&gt;Instead, the new longevity conversation may start with fiber-rich fruits, ancient grains, beans, and vegetables—not with eliminating carbs, but choosing the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 5-6
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA — A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he's among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments," said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around 1 in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing KJ's odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that's never been done before," Nicole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go," her husband added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within six months, the team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ's faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA "letter" — also known as a base — to the correct type. Known as "base editing," it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "very exciting" that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn't involved in the study. "This really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, "he slept through the entire thing," recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 ½-month old also takes less medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering his poor prognosis earlier, "any time we see even the smallest milestone that he's meeting – like a little wave or rolling over – that's a big moment for us," his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers caution that it's only been a few months. They'll need to watch him for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ," Ahrens-Nicklas said. "But every day, he's showing us signs that he's growing and thriving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musunuru said his team's work — funded in part by the National Institutes of Health — showed that creating a custom treatment doesn't have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was "not far off" from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in, and I would expect the costs to come down," Musunuru said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research "sets the stage" for treating other rare conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. "There are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we're pretty much ready."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

And all the other kids went to sleep.” This was most odd. “I was thinking: ‘Didn’t we just get here?’” Even then, White didn’t sleep much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Today White, from California, is 82. Which means that, in the years since, she has spent perhaps a decade longer conscious than her average contemporary from childhood. Last night, a pretty normal night, she went to bed at 2.30am and got up at 5.30am. And she feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="cb4187e5-7214-4ec8-8685-bb565289dbab"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Experts say people with a similar condition to White not only sleep less but also sleep better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;NATHAN WEYLAND FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“My brain doesn’t get tired, and my body doesn’t get tired. Everybody around me gets tired.&lt;span&gt; I wear everybody out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She also now knows why. A new scientific paper has argued she has a gene mutation that is, for her, a sort of superpower. It makes her a “natural short sleeper”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ying-Hui Fu, from the University of California San Francisco and the author of that paper, has worked with dozens of such people. And they are more than curiosities. She thinks they could hold the key to improving all our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What I learnt from these people is that it is possible for humans to do this. They can live a happy, active, healthy, long life.” Somehow, their quality of sleep is such that they simply don’t need as much. Imagine, she said, if every person in the world were able to sleep less but receive better results from it? Imagine if all those &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weekend-lie-ins-lower-risk-heart-disease-sleep-w80b6g7ls" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;conditions linked to poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; — Alzheimer’s, obesity, cancer — could be staved off? “We just have to figure out how.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-cant-i-sleep-bedroom-changes-p20lswspd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why can’t I sleep? Make these 5 changes to your bedroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For White, the diagnosis explains so much. It explains why she once spent 72 hours playing bridge. “After three days, I wasn’t tired. It’s a very bizarre way to live.” It explains why she is still so active — at her retirement community she teaches English as a second language, sits on committees, fixes tech products and runs a volunteer programme. “I’m always busy. My mind won’t shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It explains why, when she first got married, she found her husband to be so inexplicably indolent that one Sunday morning she threw a glass of water in his face while he slept in. “I only did it once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It also, though, poses a question. Why, if she doesn’t need to sleep so much, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-your-brain-needs-slow-wave-sleep-health-advice-2024-lgrpl58k2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;do the rest of us&lt;/a&gt;? This is what Fu wants to understand. We know sleep is extremely important. “When we are asleep our bodies remove toxins, clear up all the bad stuff, repair all the damages and all this is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While studying White several years ago, Fu recorded her sleeping for a relatively luxuriant six hours. White said this slothfulness could be explained by an undiagnosed thyroid problem. Fu said she had no reason to doubt her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;White’s mutation, while unique, fits with others among short sleepers Fu has studied. Fu and her colleagues have shown that if induced in mice, they too sleep less. Short sleepers not only need less sleep, they also do a lot better on what they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.11"&gt;&lt;div id="250e5ec5-0552-4bfd-bbce-2be2983903b6"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;White used to believe everyone else was strange for sleeping so much&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;NATHAN WEYLAND FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“For you and me, we sleep eight hours and our body completes maybe 95 per cent of all these tasks.” For them, in sometimes half the time, “they probably reach 100 per cent completion. They sleep less and do better. A lot of these people are very smart and very sharp”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Before she retired, White had several jobs. “I owned three real estate companies, doing property management.” Her husband was a clinician. “I ran his medical office. I just did whatever I could get my hands on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is pretty normal. One of Fu’s subjects does triathlons in her eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/what-to-eat-to-help-sleep-insomnia-ntzgn6h9q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to eat to help you sleep — by the insomnia expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For a long time, White didn’t think she was odd. Even as she lay awake as a child, looking at the wallpaper and listening to her parents until they went to sleep, she didn’t realise this was unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She just thought everyone else was lazy. “I always started with the idea other people had the problem. I was like: ‘Why are you coming into work grumpy because you didn’t sleep? Get a hold of yourself.’” Then, after she got married, began to have more control over her schedule and made the glass of water mistake, she had the first inklings she might be the odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Now she is pleased that she at last understands. “You go a whole lifetime of explaining yourself, of never finding everyone like you.

              &lt;p&gt;A pivotal medical milestone has been reached. For the first time ever, researchers have used a personalized CRISPR-based gene therapy to treat an infant’s rare and life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine detailed their achievement in a study &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The treated child, named KJ, was born with a metabolic disorder known to kill up to 50% of children in their infancy. Now, three months after his first dose, KJ appears to have responded well to the treatment and is doing better than ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,” said Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, director of the Gene Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Disorders Frontier Program at CHOP, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after his birth last summer, KJ was diagnosed with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/carbamoyl-phosphate-synthetase-i-deficiency/"&gt;CPS1&lt;/a&gt;) deficiency. The disorder prevents his liver from producing a key enzyme that breaks down ammonia, a common waste product, into urea (which is then flushed out in urine). Because of this, ammonia levels continue to build up, eventually causing organ damage. While rare, CPS1 can be caused by a variety of different mutations, meaning that cases often don’t share the same genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Certain treatments, including a strict low-protein diet, can help keep ammonia levels down in people with CPS1, but around half of those who develop it as infants die within the first week (cases that emerge later in life have a much higher survival rate). Until now, the only curative treatment available for CPS1 was a liver transplant. But babies like KJ typically have to wait until they’re old enough to survive the intensive procedure, during which time they’re vulnerable to the severe complications of CPS1, including permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, though, researchers at CHOP and Penn Medicine had been trying to rapidly develop customized gene therapies for people with rare genetic diseases. And KJ seemed like the perfect test case for their emerging approach. With permission from his parents and eventually the Food and Drug Administration, the team set to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of just six months, the researchers crafted, tested, and treated KJ with his own personalized gene-editing drug. The therapy uses a form of CRISPR—delivered to his liver cells using lipid nanoparticles—to edit a specific base (bases being the building blocks, or letters, of DNA) in the defective gene responsible for KJ’s condition. The goal is to repair the defect and allow his liver to break down ammonia as usual. The therapy was first tested in mice and then monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;KJ was initially given a low dose of the gene therapy, codenamed k-abe, in February 2025. After he appeared to tolerate it well, he received two higher doses in March and April with no apparent serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the months since, he’s been able to ingest increasing amounts of protein and he’s required lower doses of another treatment used to manage the condition. He did experience several common childhood infections during this time period, which can be life-threatening in people with CPS1, but he recovered with no major issues—another promising sign.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It will take time to know whether the therapy is safe over the long term, however, or if KJ might require additional treatments. But for now, everything seems to be working just as hoped. And KJ’s story is ideally only the start. The researchers believe their approach can be tweaked to treat a wide array of ultra-rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If so, KJ’s success might herald a new era of personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” said Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at Penn Medicine and lead author of the NEJM paper, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The promise of gene therapy that we’ve heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it’s going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

Known as HEALS—Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics—this model proposes that psychedelics disrupt the typical hierarchy between hemispheres, releasing the more holistic, emotionally intelligent right side from left-brain control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging shows a rightward shift in brain activity under psychedelics, aligning with traits often enhanced during these experiences, like mindfulness, empathy, and clarity. Research also finds parallels between the effects of psychedelics and practices like meditation, which also strengthen right-hemisphere networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEALS Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Proposes that psychedelics shift dominance from the left to the right hemisphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Right-brain dominance may enhance empathy, creativity, and insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuroimaging shows increased right-hemisphere activity under psychedelics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret to psychedelic drugs’ links to greater empathy and insight may lie in their ability to coax the right hemisphere of the brain into a position of dominance over the left, according to a proposed new theory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researcher Adam Levin combined his experience in therapeutic psychedelics research and psychiatric training with a review of imaging, numerous studies and previous models to support his proposal, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, Levin emphasizes not what the two brain hemispheres do, but how they approach a topic or task – working in parallel, with left-brain dominance, during typical modes of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re solving a problem, or, evolutionarily speaking, hunting for food, for example, the scope of attention differs: The left hemisphere focuses on manipulation of individual parts while the right hemisphere maintains a big-picture frame of reference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the psychedelic state, there’s a unique combination of the hemispheres coming together in a way that doesn’t usually happen in normal states of consciousness,” said Levin, a postdoctoral scholar and psychiatrist in the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education in The Ohio State University College of Social Work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost a new encounter between the left and the right hemispheres’ way of thinking and perceiving the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He calls this model of psychedelic action HEALS: Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effect, he suggests, psychedelics reverse the hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain, releasing the right hemisphere from inhibition by the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin was initially inspired in part by the writings of Iain McGilchrist, author of “The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his own clinical experience as a medical student and psychiatry resident gave Levin an up-close look at how disorders affecting one side of the brain or the other affected patients’ world view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people who lose the right hemisphere to stroke, the attentional window gets so narrow and they don’t even recognize a whole half of the world. Whereas people with an intact right hemisphere, who lose their left hemisphere, still have a broader general picture of things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these people’s experiences seem, to me, to be similar to what I’m seeing in my psychedelic research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous hypotheses about psychedelics’ effects on the brain have suggested “unrestrained cognition” occurs through the weakening of control exerted by frontal lobes and the top of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is likely true, Levin said, patterns observed in people’s reports of their psychedelic experiences suggest there’s more going on: There are increases in psychological flexibility, creativity, and social and emotional intelligence; greater empathy, harmony and connection; a broader attentional window toward novelty and “aliveness”; and clarity and insight about one’s basic existence and, in some cases, need for healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those general patterns are awfully similar to the pattern of the right hemisphere,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think psychedelics provide access to this whole picture, this whole view, that could have been operating in the background – and that’s this right hemisphere view. Restoration of this natural balance is an interesting way of explaining some of what’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies of lateral changes to brain blood flow and metabolism – brain regions’ use of glucose – that Levin analyzed showed signs of heavy activity in the frontal lobes in the right hemisphere as well as an overall rightward shift in metabolic activity under psychedelics, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing evidence that mindfulness meditation practice is linked to building new networks in the brain and increasing brain thickness in the right hemisphere is relevant to the HEALS theory, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychedelics have been linked to improvements in mindfulness with just one or two uses. And sometimes these capacities are almost at levels consistent with practiced meditators,” Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it likely, to me, that many core right-sided networks that are enhanced with practicing meditation might be enhanced briefly, or maybe longer, through psychedelics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s an opportunity after the use of psychedelics to increase and sustain mindfulness capacities in these areas of the right hemisphere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of psychedelic research is focused on therapeutic applications at Ohio State and elsewhere, but Levin expects that expansion of the field will stimulate pursuit of other research questions – including testing theories about how these substances act on the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He considers HEALS a complement to earlier theories about psychedelic action, and expects the growth in research to produce more hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think to explain something as complex as the brain, especially in the human being, you need a variety of theories to more closely approximate what’s actually happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we get too fixated on one explanation or the other, we’re going to lose track of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2142404d4556444d4d0f101410614e52540f444554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241303599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Levin et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current models of psychedelic action in the brain propose changes along the dorsal–ventral and anterior–posterior axes but neglect to address the lateral axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a novel model of psychedelic action called HEALS (Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics) which involves the reversal of the typical hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical modes of consciousness, the hemispheres act in parallel process with the left predominating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under psychedelics, as well as in other altered states of consciousness (ASCs), this hierarchy is reversed, with the right hemisphere released from inhibition by the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this model, the available neuroimaging evidence for lateralization under psychedelics is reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, various cognitive and emotional changes observed under psychedelics are contrasted with those same functions in each hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include attention; social and emotional intelligence; creativity and insight; and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article concludes with a review of laterality in other ASCs, such as meditative and trance states, and suggests that many phenomena associated with psychedelics, and other ASCs, might be explained by an atypical annealing between the hemispheres toward right hemisphere predominance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 14:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1QOVA2WExaZ1BsZmZib2FMXzVlbjdEVzB5QVpYcHc2YTRDems4RU5kbWtLVU1EdHFkOC1MNGZ4YnNjRWtiN3pLb0FEd3V4UU9FeVNIeXFtU0dUeGRNSjIzOVVBRjdCR2xGSkNETE1tWG5JZk3SAXhBVV95cUxNRnBiY3RKY0owdzV3TjVvRHpZTkNLeEE4S1Q3UHo5bG5KWW1zVmwyMDBJUkRNMkpRTVNqcS1feVg1RGFKUDQ5dTlIRlFqSjBFM092ejRZZzA3dlNUVWk2dFhvd19acDRHVUVVTG00SHBMTTZhSS1fbDU</guid></item></channel></rss>
