              &lt;p&gt;What if you could fix your damaged eye without having to shoot a laser at it? Scientists have potentially discovered a novel method of repairing the cornea, similar to LASIK, that wouldn’t require a laser or other invasive surgical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Occidental College and the University of California, Irvine, created the technique, which aims to temporarily make the cornea malleable. In experiments with rabbit eyeballs, their method appeared to work while also leaving corneal cells alive. More research is needed to vet the procedure, but if all goes well, it could become a preferred alternative to LASIK, the researchers claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a long road between what we’ve done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,” said lead researcher Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, in a &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/august/an-alternative-to-lasik-without-the-lasers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Chemical Society.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why some people avoid LASIK&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used to treat conditions like myopia, farsightedness, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea—the transparent, outer layer of the eye that captures and focuses light onto the retina—using a precise cutting laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though generally safe and effective, the surgery does permanently weaken the structural integrity of the cornea. People will also commonly experience side effects like dry eye and visual disturbances like halos; a small few will even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319231/"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; serious, if rare, complications like chronic nerve pain. Ideally, the team’s method would avoid these risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potentially safer method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is called electromechanical reshaping. Some of the authors had previously used it to manipulate other parts of the body that contain collagen and water, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5008912/"&gt;ears&lt;/a&gt;. It works by altering the pH of the tissue via short bursts of electricity, briefly allowing it to be molded as desired. Once the proper pH is restored, the tissue returns to its original rigid state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers used the technique on rabbit eyeballs in the lab, some of which were intended to represent myopia in humans. Special contact lenses made from platinum were placed over the extracted eyes. These lenses served as an electrode, providing a base for how the cornea should be correctly reshaped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the researchers lightly zapped the eye, the cornea became flexible and contoured to the shape of the lens. Not only did the cornea fill out as the researchers wanted, but the procedure didn’t seem to kill any corneal cells or otherwise affect the cornea’s stability. A YouTube video describing the team’s approach, from the American Chemical Society, can be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbJWbUt0m0"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers admit that it will take more research in animals before they can even think about testing their method in humans. Their next planned step is to try out the procedure on living rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the potential for the team’s work is certainly there, and it may extend beyond treating myopia. The researchers are also hoping to explore whether electromechanical reshaping can help repair farsightedness, astigmatism, and possibly even some forms of cloudy vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as has been the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/odds-winning-nih-grants-plummet-new-funding-policy-and-spending-delays-bite"&gt;case for many scientists&lt;/a&gt; during the second Trump administration, the researchers say their work has been delayed over concerns in securing additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

He makes the most of the SoCal weather and exercises outside as much as possible. "My aerobic stuff I like to do outside the gym," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has a gym membership and uses the weight machines for 45 minutes a few times a week. "There are some people who will be at the gym for two, three hours. For me, I'm getting in and out of there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong tells his patients to find a physical activity they enjoy and to start by doing it twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His "anything's better than nothing" approach to exercise reflects the findings of a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/15/979" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;large 2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the British Journal of Medicine Sports. The systematic review looked at self-reported data from more than 30 million people and found that those who exercised an average of 2.5 hours a week had a lower risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than their sedentary peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who exercised up to 2.5 hours longer than the average gained even more health benefits. But even working out for an hour and 15 minutes — half the recommended time of 2.5 hours — lowered the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, compared with no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8" data-toc-id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong doesn't believe in taking stacks of buzzy supplements, but said they can be useful for people with certain deficiencies or health conditions. "I only take one," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctor-supplements-every-day-lost-50-pounds-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vitamin D supplement &lt;/a&gt;each day for bone health as he ages and because testing revealed that his levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is crucial for bone density, which naturally starts to decline around the time we hit 35.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To keep his mind sharp, for an hour or two each day, Hong makes sure he does something that challenges his brain. "Your brain's like a muscle — if you don't use it, you lose it" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, work will be enough stimulation for him, but on the weekends, for example, he might play a game of chess or checkers with his kids, or read. Screentime doesn't count, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental stimulation can't prevent the brain from aging, but evidence suggests it can help build resilience against &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's disease symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as forgetfulness. This resilience is known as cognitive reserve, and studies have found that people with larger reserves, which are built through cognitive activity, developed Alzheimer's disease later in life and had fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important thing I tell all my patients is age is really a number," Hong said.

			&lt;p&gt;From warming winter teas to zesty stir-fries, ginger (&lt;em&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/em&gt;) has long been a kitchen staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond its culinary charm, this spicy root has a rich history in traditional medicine – and modern science is catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies now show that ginger may offer a wide range of health benefits, from easing nausea and relieving colds to reducing inflammation and supporting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-common-spices-could-be-interfering-with-your-medication"&gt;These 3 Common Spices Could Be Interfering With Your Medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Nausea relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;Multiple clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown consistent evidence that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, particularly when compared to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/feeling-sick-nausea/"&gt;NHS even recommends&lt;/a&gt; ginger-containing foods or teas for easing nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger seems especially effective for nausea during pregnancy. In small doses, it's considered a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131535/"&gt;safe and effective option&lt;/a&gt; for people who don't respond well to standard anti-nausea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also promising evidence that ginger can help with chemotherapy-induced nausea, though &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;results are mixed&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to motion sickness and post-surgery nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger's anti-nausea effects may work by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;blocking serotonin receptors&lt;/a&gt; and acting on both the gut and brain. It may also help by reducing gas and bloating in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is rich in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, such as gingerol and shogaol, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests ginger supplements may help regulate inflammation, especially in autoimmune conditions. &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/172011"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that ginger reduced the activity of neutrophils – white blood cells that often become overactive in diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6874304/"&gt;extracellular traps&lt;/a&gt; (NETs), which are web-like structures used to trap and kill pathogens. But when NETs form excessively, they can fuel autoimmune diseases. In the study, taking ginger daily for one week significantly reduced NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study used ginger supplements, it's unclear whether fresh ginger or tea has the same effect. Still, the findings suggest ginger may be a helpful, natural option for people with certain autoimmune conditions – though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger also has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2019.1573829#:%7E:text=Results%20indicate%20that%20ginger%20contains,interesting%20alternative%20to%20synthetic%20antimicrobials."&gt;antimicrobial properties&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can help combat bacteria,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other harmful microbes. Combined with its anti-inflammatory effects, this makes ginger a popular remedy for easing cold and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; symptoms like sore throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Pain management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pain, the research on ginger is encouraging – though not conclusive. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3665023/#ref10"&gt;Some studies show&lt;/a&gt; that ginger extract can reduce knee pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis, especially during the early stages of treatment. However, results vary, and not everyone experiences the same level of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For muscle pain, &lt;a href="https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(09)00915-8/fulltext"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that taking two grams of ginger daily for 11 days reduced soreness after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger may also ease menstrual pain. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455918302304"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its effectiveness rivals that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger works by &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;activating pathways&lt;/a&gt; in the nervous system that dampen pain signals. It may also inhibit inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Heart health and diabetes support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, high blood sugar and elevated "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL cholesterol) are all risk factors for heart disease. Ginger may help with all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165525/"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; of 26  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ginger supplementation can significantly improve cholesterol levels — lowering triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, while raising HDL ("good") cholesterol.

A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5692962"&gt;review of ten studies&lt;/a&gt; found that taking one to three grams of ginger daily for four to 12 weeks helped improve both cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits appear to come from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519348/#:%7E:text=Abstract,also%20discussed%20in%20this%20update."&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, including improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake in cells, and reduced oxidative stress. Ginger's anti-inflammatory actions may also contribute to its heart-protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809190/"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-sex"&gt;benefits for sexual health&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence in humans is still limited. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316093/"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ginger can boost testosterone levels, improve blood flow, and enhance sexual behaviour. In traditional medicine systems, it has long been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377061/"&gt;used as an aphrodisiac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's not yet strong clinical evidence to confirm a direct impact on libido, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12007927/"&gt;ginger's anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, circulatory and hormonal effects could play a supportive role, particularly for people managing conditions like diabetes or oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Brain health and cancer research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8971783/"&gt;neuroprotective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt; benefits. Lab-based studies show that ginger compounds can help protect brain cells from oxidative damage – a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other in-vitro research has found that ginger can slow the growth of some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells. However, these findings are still in early stages and more research is needed to confirm their relevance in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is generally safe when consumed in food or tea. But like any supplement, it should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170653" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg" alt="ginger tea" class="wp-image-170653 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ginger is safe to drink in moderation as a tea.

These are usually mild and temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;Certain groups&lt;/a&gt; should use caution with high doses. Ginger may increase bleeding risk in people on blood thinners (like warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel), and it can enhance the effects of diabetes or blood pressure medications, potentially leading to low blood sugar or blood pressure. Pregnant women should also consult a doctor before using high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ginger isn't just a fragrant kitchen spice – it's a natural remedy with growing scientific support. For most people, enjoying ginger in food or tea is a safe and effective way to tap into its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering taking supplements, it's always best to speak with your doctor or pharmacist first, especially if you're managing a medical condition or taking medication.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261506/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors soon discovered they were infected with the rare soil bacterium, which causes a disease called melioidosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous infection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose and tricky to treat, as it is naturally resistant to some antibiotics. It can infect people if they breathe it in or get it into open cuts. Sometimes the infection can stay localized, like a lung infection or a skin ulcer. But it can also get into the blood and become a systemic infection, spreading to various organs, including the brain. Fatality rates can be as high as 90 percent in people who are not treated but fall to less than 40 percent in people who receive prompt, proper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men in 2024 were quickly hospitalized and diagnosed with sepsis. Both were treated with heavy antibiotic regimens and recovered, though patient 2 relapsed in November, requiring another hospital stay. He ultimately recovered again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, about a dozen melioidosis cases are identified each year in the US on average, but most occur in people who have traveled to areas known to harbor the bacterium. Neither of the men infected last year had recently traveled to any such places. So the researchers turned to genetic sequencing, which revealed the link to two cases in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases, both men died from the infection. The man dubbed Patient 3 died in October of 1989. He was a veteran who fought in Vietnam—where the bacterium is endemic—two decades prior to his infection. The researchers note that such a long latency period for a &lt;em&gt;B. pseudomallei&lt;/em&gt; infection is not entirely out of the question, but it would be rare to have such a large gap between an exposure and an infection. More suspiciously, the researchers note that in the month prior to Patient 3's death, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Georgia as a Category 4 storm, dumping three to five inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

Her grandmother died of complications from RA, and in the last few months of her life, it was Smith who served as her caregiver, administering doses of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:methotrexate;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt; to treat her pain and inflammation. The drug, a form of chemotherapy also used to treat cancer, is so potent that Smith had to wear gloves to safely give it to her grandmother. So, when Smith’s doctor told her she too would probably have to take methotrexate long-term, her heart sank. “That was so scary for me,” she tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith’s RA and weight — 311 pounds — were “double negatives” against her health, her doctor said. She &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to lose the weight. And so Smith started following the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5 or 6 pounds in the process. But that wasn’t nearly enough to alleviate the excessive inflammation and pain in her joints during flare-ups, which could last as long as four months. Smith was in constant pain. Some days, she couldn’t go to work. Other times, she was physically incapable of playing with her 4-year-old daughter. “It was stress on top of stress, and those are some of the main triggers of a flare,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GLP-1 weight loss medications haven’t been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. But they’ve &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4823510/#:~:text=It%20was%20reported%20that%20GLP,on%20its%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20actions." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While Smith’s insurance wouldn’t cover the medication (deeming it for “cosmetic weight loss”), she got a prescription for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/millions-of-people-are-taking-compounded-weight-loss-drugs-now-theyre-about-to-disappear-202621562.html" data-ylk="slk:compounded semaglutide;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;compounded semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; from a local provider and, later, compounded tirzepatide from an online provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven months later, Smith, 30, hasn’t had a single arthritis flare-up. “I’ve been able to come off my rheumatoid arthritis medicines — and these are medications that people &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;come off of,” she says. It’s the biggest way that Smith’s life has changed since starting a GLP-1, but far from the only shift. For this installment of the Yahoo series &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tagged/on-my-weigh/" data-ylk="slk:On My Weigh;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On My Weigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Smith explains in her own words how the medication has helped her teach her daughter healthy eating habits and given her the clarity she needed to leave the teaching job that had burned her out. “Since being on a GLP-1, I put myself and my mental and physical health first,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Smith has lost nearly 70 pounds since starting tirzepatide.

She was missing out, and I just wanted to change that and be able to play with her. And I wanted to get off of methotrexate, the potent medication I was taking for my rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress report: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel amazing. My inflammation levels are down, I’m happier and I haven’t had a single arthritis flare-up since I’ve been on tirzepatide. I’m full of energy, I’m back to loving going out and dressing up — I just see myself. I’ve lost 69 pounds in seven months, and the other day I was able to put a towel all the way around me to cover up. I don’t think I’d been able to do that since high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food noise volume: &lt;/strong&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, my food noise was an 8 out of 10. Until recently, I was a full-time schoolteacher, plus I’m a full-time mom and girlfriend to a full-time musician. Staying busy kept my food noise at bay. But when I did want to eat, I wanted to eat the wrong way. Now that I’m on a GLP-1, I can’t say my food noise is completely gone. But it’s at about a 3, and when I do have cravings, it’s for taco salad, or soup or broccoli. It’s very weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="day-in-the-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="rise-and-shine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and shine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to my GLP-1 journey, I woke up in pain every morning. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could physically get up and move out of bed. I was so angry at my body. I felt like I was too young to be waking up in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I just jump up. I wake up at 5:15 a.m., go to the bathroom and jump on the scale. Then I tell my social media followers, “Good morning, this is going to be a good day.” I get my daughter up at about 6:30 a.m. I’m happy, and I go into her room refreshed because I’ve gotten a good night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="first-bites"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I used to have a bacon, egg and cheese croissant, hash browns and a large iced coffee from Burger King or McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I might get similar things when I eat breakfast out, but I no longer get full combo meals. I don’t drink coffee or sodas. I just have hydration packets in my water that I bring from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, I make eggs with some kind of meat or protein. Sometimes I’ll still have a croissant, but I purchase them from Sam’s Club now. They have fewer calories and 16 grams of protein. Even though I’m not always cooking, what I’m eating is better-quality food. And I make sure I’m always getting protein with breakfast. I’m setting myself up for success with that first bite, rather than eating those potatoes and iced coffee that are going to have me crashing by 12 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="get-ready-with-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before, everything I wore was very dark. We all know that black covers up everything. I would just throw on some sweatpants or joggers and just go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I actually care what I look like. I wake up earlier, because I want to have time to choose colors that I feel good and comfortable in. I like to wear a lot of different patterns. Prior to my major weight gain, I used to be a girl who loved heels. I’m slowly getting back into heels and jewelry, because I feel beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="make-a-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For about four years, before I started my GLP-1 journey, I had a gym membership that I never used. Now I know that gym life just isn’t for me. I’ll go every now and again, but it’s not a long-term solution because it’s not something that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But now I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in a season where I want to do things that I enjoy &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are good for me. Since starting my GLP-1, I’ve canceled my gym membership. Instead, I’ve been trying to incorporate things that I can maintain into my day-to-day routine — things like taking daily walks with my daughter and going to the park and playing with her. I have weights, a squat machine, a sit-up machine and a foldable elliptical all at home. When I feel like it, I go downstairs and work out. But I don’t want to put myself back in a position where I’m doing things just because people say I should. I want to be the captain of my own boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dose-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m actually on a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peptide-stacking-latest-viral-wellness-162349352.html" data-ylk="slk:whole peptide stack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;whole peptide stack&lt;/a&gt;, which is a set of several injections my doctor prescribed to help optimize my health.

Wednesday, I take the NAD+, Friday, I take NAD+ and Lipo-C. I feel like I have a really good stack, and it is prescribed by a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor. I think it helps me to feel like the best version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I consider Sunday nights my cheat night. I’ll eat something more fatty than usual, like a taco salad (but I’ll actually eat the shell), or I’ll have Olive Garden cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. I try to give my body something to eat the night before I take my medications. My cravings are stronger right before my shot days. But I’ve been able to train myself to be disciplined while having grace for myself and understand that it’s OK to eat things that you enjoy. Plus, now I crave things that I love &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is more active — and wearing bright colors — since starting a GLP-1. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty, courtesy of Cassandra Smith)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-do-lunch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s do lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My pre-GLP-1 lunch was a burger, some fried chicken nuggets, hot wings — anything fried, that was quick to grab-and-go or pick up from the drive-through. Cooking was just never my concern back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I actually take the time to cook instead, because I’ve realized that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A typical lunch these days is whatever I didn’t eat the night before for dinner. We all know that those of us on GLP-1s don’t eat as much and we always have leftovers. So, I’ve learned to love them. I never used to eat them, because I was going to fast food restaurants a lot — and who wants to eat McDonald’s the next day? Every now and then I’ll splurge and get some sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="happy-hour"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, I didn’t really feel like I had free time. I spent a lot of it sleeping. I felt mentally drained from dealing with kids all day (much as I love them) and crashing from what I ate. I would get home and just sleep. I called it hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I feel like I have more time — and did even before I quit my job. I enjoy going to Ulta and looking at new skin care, or going window-shopping at TJ Maxx. I know I’m still transitioning sizes, so I restrain myself from buying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any time spent with my child is quality time for me. But now it’s actually quality time for &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn’t have to just sit in bed and watch TV because that’s all I physically can do. We’re going to the park, we go on nature walks, we go to my parents’ house in the middle of the week because I have the energy to drive there, instead of being too drained because I ate potatoes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quantity of time with her hasn’t changed, but the quality of it has changed drastically. It’s more intentional, and she gains more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dinner-bell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I never had enough time in the day to really focus on what to eat before my GLP-1 journey. It was just, &lt;em&gt;Throw it in the microwave, throw it in the oven. &lt;/em&gt;When I went out for dinner,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I used to love to get steak. But when I found out that I had rheumatoid arthritis, steak would cause me to flare. So I stopped eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, my go-to protein is salmon, with a veggie, and they’re both cooked in my house. As soon as I began taking tirzepatide, I started to make sure protein was in every single thing I was eating. That first month or so, I tracked everything. But I learned how much protein and how many calories were in the things I was eating — as people on GLP-1s, we eat the same things over and over — and it just became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My doctor taught me to stay on the outside aisles of the store when I go to the grocery store. As long as you stay on those walls, you’re eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats and fresh eggs. If you’re buying food from the center of the store, the more sodium and calories you’re getting in those processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a 4-year-old daughter, it’s so exciting for me to be able to raise her in a way that I wish I had been raised. Cooking is a whole activity for us, and for her, cooking healthy food will be normal. I get to create that generational knowledge with my daughter and save her from having to be on a GLP-1 later, because she has had the opportunity to learn to eat the right things from the beginning. She asks if we’re having salmon and broccoli for dinner. Today, my sister picked my daughter and my nephew up and they went to McDonald’s. My daughter didn’t want anything. She understands, at 4 years old, that we don’t eat that. My mom makes treats for major events, and sometimes she’ll eat some of the extras. My daughter will be like, “Grandma, you shouldn’t eat that!” My mom says, “Get this little girl, she’s doing too much!” But I love it. I know that, even when I’m not present, the things I taught her still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-get-the-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get the bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before I started taking tirzepatide, I was spending a lot of money eating out every day with my daughter. At Chick-fil-A, we were spending $25 on one meal. It added up to about $800 a month. And on top of that was the junk I was buying at the grocery store to stock up the house. It probably totaled about $1,200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, Shed, my provider, has really good prices for GLP-1s. I spend about $300 a month on my medications. Ultimately, I’m saving money. My budget is better, and I’m able to invest more and help the people around me more because I’m not going out every day spending money on food. The bill is amazing. I love the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:27:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQM0dDWnh2MFM0aEdxVG1ua3dNa1JfWldLd2lkcWh1SEVQeUdQNVY3cjBjS1YwLWwtT3EtQ2UyNERrZFczcVZ5TTlRQ1dibWhtQjZfcjNoQ3NiVG5nazZqMVk1U1FqVTRpczBUaHVhUVhiSkswTUh1LWVqZHJQS2gxQUxvTjJ6ekVtNk9MTkpVbVhmMmJPUFpqNnNvOTE5TklMSGFqdC1mNndLNzVuSzNFNWVYb1pyTVNxT0dwbTVOVWRjRFlvc3M4ZmdpMnh3UQ</guid></item><item><title>如何在不用药物的情况下降低血压- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQemc0REZ5R0dSRFdzMktHRFd2NzdCa29zMlRNZEV3UU9RQnl2ZE9LZnZEQnJRbXpkcmZOOHROd21Rcm5SYTdBdUtHVE04ZjdNYzdkUzBhY0o1WGNVcms3YklNWS1SczI0UUpuZ25sbVZTLXY2b0VfVHVieC1odk1DVmN2QmYteldJVDhLRzFsd0dJV1RfTFdN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="video-resource__details--leaf"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/117060" target="_blank"&gt;recent pediatric COVID-19 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which differ from those of the CDC, have raised concerns from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who responded with an oblique warning to any physicians who might follow the AAP's advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AAP should ... be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC's official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act," Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1957914911415153107" target="_blank"&gt;posted this week on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1hkbqsd*_ga*OTExMTY4NzUwLjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjU1NDAzOTU5LjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;The AAP recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, released on Tuesday, included a strong endorsement of COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to under 2 years. The group also recommended COVID shots for older children if the parents want to do that. Those recommendations differ from &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/115822" target="_blank"&gt;guidance issued by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, which has said the vaccines are not specifically recommended for children although they can still get them if parents and providers agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Kennedy correct about the liability issue? "As has become common for Secretary Kennedy, this is misleading," Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dorit.reiss/posts/pfbid02WqwdHBfNN82WeFwBSFHrYKgGu8JVLH8wcpTzBnCkVGFiSUSs56ptqgHoVTAeismTl?rdid=GFdlkNAZtmmkImnu" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. "Whether a vaccine falls under VICP [the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the part of the Vaccine Injury Act that deals with liability issues] has nothing to do with whether AAP recommends it, and the liability protections are not removed by this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a vaccine is covered by VICP, liability protections apply to manufacturers and administrators: anyone claiming a vaccine harm from a childhood vaccine that is under VICP has to go through the program first," she said. "ACIP has not actually changed the current recommendations in ways that affect VICP." Furthermore, "COVID-19 vaccines for children are not under VICP, but that's not because of anything AAP did or the secretary, even, did  --  it's because Congress has not yet legislated to create an excise tax for COVID-19 vaccines, and until Congress does that, they're not within VICP."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Kirkland, PhD, JD, professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, agreed with Reiss that the COVID vaccine doesn't fall within the VICP and so is not affected by the CDC's new recommendation. However, "it could hint at future changes if Kennedy plans to withdraw recommendations from other childhood vaccines that are currently covered under the Vaccine Injury Act, which would mean that they no longer meet the statutory definition for coverage in the compensation program," she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This development should not change doctors' willingness to recommend pediatric vaccines, which still have all the safety and compensation protections that they had prior to Kennedy taking office," she added. "There do seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/washington-watch/116707" target="_blank"&gt;changes in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; on the way, though it's hard to know from Kennedy's remarks exactly what he has planned. Removing childhood vaccines from the compensation program could upend vaccine markets and leave the small number of people who suffer an adverse reaction without a plausible path to compensation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her Facebook post, Reiss reminded readers that "in spite of [his] implied threat, Secretary Kennedy would not be bringing any cases" to court related to vaccine injuries. Instead, "parents who think their children were harmed by COVID-19 vaccines are the relevant ones here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Kennedy did want to remove another vaccine from the VICP, she noted, "ACIP would have to completely not recommend it for children and pregnant women" instead of just saying it had to be administered after shared decision making between parents and providers. "And then," she added, "the secretary would have to open a rulemaking process  --  publish the change in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;, solicit comments, and publish a final decision. And a company making that vaccine, or someone denied a vaccine because of removal of liability protections, could sue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his tweet, Kennedy also called the AAP recommendations "corporate-friendly" and said that "The Trump administration believes in free speech and AAP has a right to make its case to the American people. But AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest, including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal  --  &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;  --  so that Americans may ask whether the AAP's recommendations reflect public health interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP's Big Pharma benefactors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP fired back. "This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts," AAP President Susan Kressly, MD, said in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;.​ "Our immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation's leading health experts. We are transparent about our funders​, follow rigorous conflict-of-interest disclosures, and maintain safeguards to ensure the integrity and independence of our guidance. We welcome an opportunity to sit down with the secretary to review our recommendations and restore our seat at the table."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last sentence in AAP's statement referred to some changes that Kennedy has made to vaccine policymaking at the CDC. In June, he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/115987" target="_blank"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  --  which advises the CDC on its immunization recommendations  --  and &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116026" target="_blank"&gt;replaced them with eight people&lt;/a&gt;, including known vaccine skeptics; some of the new members reportedly have their own conflicts of interest related to serving as expert witnesses in legal proceedings targeted at vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the AAP, the American Medical Association, and other healthcare groups &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116802" target="_blank"&gt;were told at the end of July&lt;/a&gt; that they could no longer participate in ACIP work groups, which convene in between ACIP meetings to develop recommendation options for ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;

However, now that he’s gone, Colleen has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight, and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was the youngest of five children,” Colleen said. “He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother’s shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren’t sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. Scott’s mother fought for her son’s right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School’s very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments according to Colleen. Scott helped write Idaho’s Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight,” said Colleen. “He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;

Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads but something that gave him much pleasure in life. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. “There are so many others who do a much better job,” he would say. “These are just silly little stories anyone could write.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, “Nobody would believe I really did those things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, Scott reluctantly “retired.” That’s when he began writing the “little stories” about his life that grew into two volumes of “Tales from the High Lonesome.” They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;

Author and Island Park News columnist Scott Hancock at a book signing in Island Park with his friend and fellow author EC Stilson of Pocatello. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Colleen has since published Volume 3, now available on Amazon, fulfilling the promise she made to her husband to publish it. She plans to combine Scott’s remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott’s books are available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/tales-high-lonesome-scott-hancock/dp/b08gdkghl2"&gt;Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler’s Market in Blackfoot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/06/keslers-gives-local-authors-a-place-to-sell-books/"&gt;RELATED: Kesler’s gives local authors a place to sell books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Colleen emphasizes that writing was just a small part of Scott’s accomplishments and who he was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people,” said Colleen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Colleen, sharing Scott’s legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you,” Colleen concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg" alt="Scott Hancock 1982 article" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-772270" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-860x575.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-748x500.jpg 748w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-600x401.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said Friday that an adult living in central Maryland has tested positive for West Nile virus, which is the first confirmed human case in the state so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is currently recovering from the infection. The health department did not confirm which county the person is residing, citing patient confidentiality issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is transmitted to humans through infected mosquitoes that have contracted the disease through birds. In rare cases, the virus can also be spread from person to person through organ donation, blood transfusion or from a pregnant woman to a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge people to be vigilant and take steps to avoid infection, such as eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes can breed,” Deputy Secretary for Public Health Services Dr. Meg Sullivan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 18 Maryland residents tested positive for West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80% of those infected with the disease do not develop symptoms, but some may experience mild symptoms, such as fever, headache and body aches, as well as skin rashes or swollen lymph lands. Symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus, which mainly affects the nervous system, is often more severe for those over 50 or those with previous health conditions once infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D.C. health officials also recently came across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/08/dc-health-urges-residents-to-take-precautions-after-several-birds-test-positive-for-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four dead American crows that tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus in Wards 2, 3, 5 and 7. D.C. Health recommended residents to take precautions by wearing long-sleeved clothing and wear EPA-approved mosquito repellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland health department urges people who are concerned about mosquito bites to cover up exposed skin and monitor their yards and gardens for high mosquito activity, especially areas with standing water that can attract the insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department launched a campaign in May to prevent mosquito bites, including a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yb0rvqfc0ue6fuidlwsg8/AOFoms-9xmKJ4S0GcqBgQ7g?rlkey=v2cvfm5v8oktn1jjxjpekxlkk&amp;amp;st=bghygnnw&amp;amp;dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social media tool kit&lt;/a&gt; to educate Marylanders on protecting themselves and their homes from mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although birds are not routinely tested for West Nile virus in Maryland, sick or injured birds can be reported to an appropriate local wildlife rehabilitator. Residents can call 877-463-6497 for a list of licensed rehabilitators or visit the &lt;a href="https://dnr.maryland.gov/Wildlife/Pages/plants_wildlife/wildlifeproblems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00023b6nbr204xax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00053b6nug8ai2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00073b6nbd5esv9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00093b6nqlqmylw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen7glcz00073b6oiaq1zcwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000a3b6n5tc2dr48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000b3b6nutie338n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000c3b6n531u43t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As summer winds down and fall routines start to set in, weeknight dinners can feel chaotic. But whether it means making quick dinners before shuttling kids to soccer games or gathering the whole family a bit later, prepping dinner doesn’t need to be stressful. This week’s recipes—made in three steps or less—will help you have a delicious dinner on the table in no time. Each dinner comes in around 500 calories per serving, a level at which most people feel satisfied. Of course, this number is just meant to be a guide, so be sure to listen to your hunger and fullness cues. Let’s dig in!&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKERSBURG, W.Va&lt;/strong&gt;. — Land owners across several counties of West Virginia’s Mid-Ohio Valley started to make grim discoveries in the past couple of weeks. Largely in the Parkersburg area people were finding large numbers of dead deer in small groups on their property. The carnage was also reported on the other side of the Ohio River to the Ohio Division of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia Division of Natural Resources wildlife disease specialist Ethan Barton confirmed the culprit was Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease or EHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thus far the disease is confirmed in deer in Ritchie County along with Wood, Jackson, and Pleasants County. We do have a few samples pending in a few other areas too. Across the river, the Ohio Division of Natural Resources has also confirmed cases just on the other side of the river in Washington, Athens, and Meigs County,” said Barton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is not uncommon and is spread by an infected midge. The tiny insect, often called a “noseeum” can quickly infect an entire herd of deer. However, the virus isn’t necessarily a death sentence for the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re very, very small biting flies and essentially it’s a bug virus which causes problems for ruminants of which the whitetail deer is the most susceptible to mortality,” explained Barton. “But some deer will survive infection. It’s a vector borne disease and a deer has to be bitten to contract it and there needs to be sufficient virus in the bite. There are a lot of variables and those who survive are going to be immune to future infection with that same virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of an outbreak can be disturbing. Multiple deer can be dead only yards apart making the damage look quite dramatic. Parkersburg Mayor Tom Joyce noted the city’s crews have removed nine dead deer from yards in the city this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reports started around the beginning of August when the regular rain the state had been experiencing in the spring and through much of the summer gave way to dry conditions. According to Barton, that’s the typical pattern which can lead to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typical conditions you would expect an HD outbreak would be a very wet spring and summer followed by an August that dries out,” said Barton. “If you’ve got a lot of midges then the stage is kind of set,.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the outbreak will be certain when the first frost arrives and kills all of the infected midges which had been spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in January and initially had links to the West Texas outbreak. The state confirmed 87 illnesses linked to the outbreak, 80% of them in children and 90% in people who were not vaccinated. Eight patients were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials thanked public health, medical, and lab workers who they said worked tirelessly through the outbreak, and they urged the public to keep their guard up against the measles, given multiple ongoing outbreaks in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wisconsin outbreak grows, Pennsylvania warns of exposures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Oconto County Public Health have &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/082225.htm"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; five more measles infections linked to nine earlier cases reported from Oconto County in early August, bringing the total to 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the ongoing investigation indicates that measles is spreading locally. Oconto County is located in northeastern Wisconsin and is part of the Green Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other measles developments, the Pennsylvania Department of Health yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/newsroom/doh-announces-confirmed-measles-case-in-out-of-state-individual"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an alert about potential measles exposures in four counties after an out-of-state traveler visited the state while contagious. The exposures occurred in Adams, Clearfield, Lancaster, and York counties. Locations included two Mennonite facilities, along with a travel center, a restaurant, and an entertainment venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that tolcapone increased activity in brain regions involved in inhibitory control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These changes were associated with improved performance on a self-control task and fewer drinks consumed during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder involves both strong motivation to consume alcohol and a reduced ability to inhibit that motivation. Brain circuits that support self-control are thought to be impaired in people with this condition. Specifically, lower dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex has been observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder, and this may contribute to the loss of behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to treat alcohol use disorder with dopamine-related medications have had mixed results, possibly because these drugs influence dopamine levels across broad brain regions. In contrast, tolcapone offers a more targeted approach. It inhibits an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase, which breaks down dopamine primarily in the prefrontal cortex. By increasing dopamine availability specifically in this region, tolcapone may help restore some of the self-regulatory functions that are disrupted in alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol use disorder is a prevalent and devastating disease for which only three medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said study author &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/trail-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Joseph P. Schacht&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These existing medications are believed to work by reducing craving for alcohol and/or changing its acute effects (increasing negative effects or reducing euphoric effects). A core symptom of alcohol use disorder is loss of control over drinking, and we wanted to explore whether a different kind of medication, which might increase behavioral control, might be effective for people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tolcapone, an FDA-approved medication for Parkinson’s disease. Tolcapone inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. This means that it can transiently increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine. We often think of dopamine as being related to reward and euphoria, but in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine is critical for many cognitive processes that involve behavioral control. We thought that, by increasing prefrontal dopamine, tolcapone might increase behavioral control among people with alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina. Participants were adults aged 21 to 40 who met diagnostic criteria for moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. They were required to drink at least 20 standard drinks per week and were not seeking treatment for their alcohol use. A total of 64 individuals with usable brain imaging data were included in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tolcapone or a placebo for eight days. Tolcapone dosage was gradually increased to a maximum of 200 mg three times per day. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after the medication period. The primary task used to measure self-control was the stop-signal task, which requires individuals to inhibit a dominant motor response when signaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tracked participants’ alcohol consumption using a daily self-report tool. To ensure the accuracy of the brain imaging results, several quality control measures were implemented, including controlling for motion during scanning and using different MRI scanner settings as covariates in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants who received tolcapone showed improvements in inhibitory control. This was measured by shorter stop-signal reaction times, indicating that they were better able to withhold a response when prompted. They also showed more behavioral adjustment after making errors, another indicator of improved self-regulation. These improvements were not seen in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to changes in behavior, tolcapone also increased activity in brain areas involved in self-control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These increases were only observed in the tolcapone group. Notably, individuals who showed greater increases in activation in these areas also tended to report less alcohol consumption during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We suspected that greater tolcapone-induced prefrontal cortex activation might be related to better performance on the task, but were pleasantly surprised to find that it was also related to less alcohol consumption,” Schacht told PsyPost. “This suggests that tolcapone’s effect on behavioral control in the brain scanner translated to changes in real-world behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found changes in how brain regions communicated with each other. Tolcapone increased connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and two other brain regions—the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex—that are also involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control. These enhanced connections were linked to better task performance and fewer drinks consumed, but again, only in participants who received tolcapone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that boosting dopamine levels specifically in the prefrontal cortex may help restore self-control in people with alcohol use disorder. This has been a longstanding goal in addiction research, but previous approaches have struggled to achieve this without unintended effects in other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that tolcapone can influence both brain activity and real-world drinking behavior, the findings suggest that targeted dopamine modulation could be a promising therapeutic approach. The inferior frontal gyrus, in particular, emerged as a central hub in the network supporting self-regulation, with its activity and connectivity predicting both task performance and drinking outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure activity in the prefrontal cortex while people engaged in a simple behavioral control task,” Schacht summarized. “We found that tolcapone, relative to placebo, increased activation of a brain region called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and that increased activation of this region was associated with better behavioral control (better performance on the task) and less alcohol consumption during the time people were taking the medication. This suggests that medications like tolcapone that affect prefrontal dopamine might be a novel strategy for treating alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the mechanism appears to be related to dopamine, the researchers caution that other neurotransmitter systems—such as norepinephrine and glutamate—could also be involved. Additional studies will be needed to disentangle these contributions and to examine whether the effects of tolcapone extend beyond self-control to other aspects of alcohol use disorder, such as craving or mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, some limitations should be noted. The sample size, while sufficient for the planned analyses, was relatively small. Larger trials will be needed to confirm these results and assess how long the benefits of tolcapone might last. The study also excluded people with psychiatric comorbidities or other substance use disorders, so the generalizability of the findings to more diverse clinical populations remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers were not able to test genetic differences in how participants responded to the drug. The study was designed to examine whether genetic variation in a dopamine-related gene (COMT rs4680) affected the drug’s impact, but the number of participants in each genetic subgroup was too small to draw firm conclusions. Prior studies suggest that people with certain genetic variants may respond more strongly to tolcapone, and this will be an important area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although it is approved for Parkinson’s disease, tolcapone has the potential for liver toxicity, which can be dangerous among people who may have alcohol-associated liver disease,” Schacht noted. “In this study, we used tolcapone under very controlled conditions (people had to have normal liver function to participate, and they took the medication for only 8 days). There are several approved COMT inhibitors that are not toxic to the liver, but they do not cross the blood-brain barrier like tolcapone does. We hope that COMT inhibitors that are brain-penetrant but not hepatotoxic will be developed in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to better understand whether the effects of tolcapone are specific to improving inhibition of alcohol-related impulses or whether they reflect a broader enhancement of executive function. Future studies could compare how the drug affects brain responses to alcohol cues versus non-alcohol-related tasks, or examine whether it changes patterns of decision-making or emotional regulation in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03904498" target="_blank"&gt;completing a large study&lt;/a&gt; in which we are testing tolcapone among people with alcohol use disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,” Schacht said. “This is a population for which improvements in behavioral control might be especially impactful. We hope to publish our findings within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More efficacious medications for alcohol use disorder are badly needed. This study was one small step towards a larger goal within the alcohol research community of identifying novel medications to help improve the treatment of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Effects of COMT suppression in a randomized trial on the neural correlates of inhibitory processing among people with Alcohol Use Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Drew E. Winters and Joseph P. Schacht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:31:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQUDF5ZDZPcWtQbk1Lbk1Jd1o0RXdVeXpudlZCMzZ3U2NNemdTNGxBaFVFWXhPOVBNZG5MbUhYN2Z3WEF2YXhWRFRlY2hBbWJ5MDI0ZzlxZGdCSHIxa283Q3VuUF9HZ280aWU0Ylc4aFRMOGJxajFFTVpQUzJMbWRieERzMEVEZF9ZLTUwVHN4bml4UU41YnlQUW5mOGJ1aklRT1g1ZEZhd3U3MVl1TjYtZFJyb1NPc1hodHFiMnlvR2hoNmph</guid></item><item><title>新冠疫苗反对者被任命为联邦审查小组组长-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1rdExwVjl2a2FtM2NHNHBOOVBTVE5XUFlPYnE4TXU5ckUzeV93X0g1ZkFDcTU4bG40TlZCN3VPYnQtVXhYMUZwdEJ2ek5LcEQwQjE4b2Q1dkd3ZHV3Y0pMRkFWX3ltUUlBbWtJUjdZdDdmWjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:51:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1rdExwVjl2a2FtM2NHNHBOOVBTVE5XUFlPYnE4TXU5ckUzeV93X0g1ZkFDcTU4bG40TlZCN3VPYnQtVXhYMUZwdEJ2ek5LcEQwQjE4b2Q1dkd3ZHV3Y0pMRkFWX3ltUUlBbWtJUjdZdDdmWjQ</guid></item><item><title>缅因州地中海解决新生儿重症监护病房的蝙蝠问题-《波特兰先驱报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPMDJ0Yk5LZ3VGQTRHZEdBamJwNm5xVjU0LXVScU1sMEpvdkZHOXczRFRxMDAxcWdnVFdqR2RyanZMS2ZwQ1RQY3NXN2tQQm56WndRNlhVeG9FNm04TzVIY0ZDeTNyemNvRkZBSVdIV2d1a210UG9FRnlRc1FPZ3VSQXVXMG96bHhvWnVQd2FRNzJaenAwb2pia201eE52cDBObWVKVjNfTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="inner-article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland has struggled in recent years to keep bats from getting into the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit, prompting a complaint last year to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials said on Thursday they are currently addressing the “occasional incursions from bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite efforts to control bats at the Coulombe Family Tower, where the NICU and the critical care nursery are located, hospital officials confirmed there have been seven bat sightings this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees filed an OSHA complaint about the bats in June 2024 and since then the hospital has launched numerous measures to keep them from getting into the hospital. This includes replacing the facade at the Coulombe Family Tower, John Porter, MaineHealth spokesperson, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="exco-adslot" class="opscoad-exco-adslot" data-unit="/6119/pressherald.com/life/health"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSHA complaint has since been resolved, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OSHA accepted MaineHealth Maine Medical Center’s corrective action plan. No fine was issued, and required notices were posted,” Porter said in the statement. An OSHA official on Friday confirmed that the hospital addressed the complaint and the case is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Porter said “there have been no known bites of patients or staff” and that “every bat caught has been tested for rabies and they all have been negative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No patients or workers were tested for rabies, Porter said, because “there have been no instances where testing a person for rabies was advisable or necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last known human case of &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/news/maine-cdc-shares-tips-prevent-getting-rabies-bats-thu-07312025-1200"&gt;rabies in Maine was reported in 1937&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Ten captured bats tested positive statewide for rabies in 2024, according to the latest statistics available from the Maine CDC. Tests of the bats captured at Maine Med were conducted by Maine CDC labs, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A Maine Med nurse with direct knowledge of the situation told the Press Herald that workers have complained about bats in the Coulombe Family Tower for years, but that hospital officials were slow to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee asked to remain anonymous over concerns she would be retaliated against by hospital management for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think they are working on resolving it now, after the OSHA complaint, but they were slow in starting to do anything about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, dated about a week after the complaint was filed, noted problems with bats going back to 2023. Bat incursions into the hospital accelerated in 2024 — with six sightings — and was likely related to bats getting in at the site of where building repairs were being done at the tower, according to the letter, obtained by the Press Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Press Herald shared a copy of the letter on Thursday with Porter, who said in the statement that “in addition to on-going pest-mitigation work by contractors, MaineHealth Maine Medical Center is currently undergoing a façade renovation project in the Coulombe Family Tower, which should also address bat incursions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee said MaineHealth should have notified the public about the bat problem, “especially since we are talking about newborn babies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_42839617" class="caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-intermediate wp-image-42839617" src="https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt data-full-size="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/print/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg" data-should-sell="no" data-lazy-src="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg?w=750"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-intermediate wp-image-42839617" src="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg?w=750" alt="" data-full-size="https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/print/42836028_20250821_maine-med-bats_4.jpg" data-should-sell="no"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scaffolding surrounds Maine Medical Center while repair work between the older, lower part of The Coulombe Family Tower and the newer two upper floors continues. The tower has been infiltrated by bats. (Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer) &lt;span class="credit"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter, explaining why the public wasn’t notified last year, said that MaineHealth “relies upon regulatory agencies,” including OSHA, to “determine what disclosures are required for its care team, patients and the public when an incident of this nature occurs. MaineHealth has complied fully with those requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, the hospital protected patients by temporarily closing a portion of the critical care nursery, which is a unit where babies need specialized care but are in a condition that is not as severe as babies in the neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other steps included sealing various areas to prevent bats from entering and pest control measures, including disinfecting and monitoring areas where bats could get in, such as heating and air conditioning ductwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter said the hospital responded in 2024 “by moving staff and patients and working with contractors to minimize intrusions by bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures to control bats are ongoing, Porter said, as the hospital “continues to take all necessary steps to mitigate the problem and protect patients and care team members in cooperation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat populations in the Northeast have rebounded in recent years, after bats learned to better avoid places where a fungus grew that was reducing their populations in the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2023, she suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated by her neighbors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the reason for the episode remains unknown (at least to Chapman-Hart), she believes that a significant part of her medical problems could have been avoided if doctors had listened to what she was saying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s been a lack of accountability,” she claimed. And while noting that she did not wish to call out those responsible, there is a lot that can be learned from the experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s so that we can learn. There’s no funding for research, but we are research. Our lived experience is research – capture it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 is extremely rare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 is the most common of the four main variants of the disorder and is usually the result of the skull being too small for the brain, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6008-chiari-malformation" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;according&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kyushu University have demonstrated that yogurt intake increases the diversity of gut microbiota and alters its composition. Furthermore, bathing in chloride hot springs after yogurt intake was found to improve defecation status more than yogurt alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that combining two &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lifestyle+interventions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lifestyle interventions&lt;/a&gt;—yogurt intake and hot spring bathing—may contribute to better health, highlighting their potential application for preventive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1609102" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy gut environment is vital for overall health, as it plays a key role in regulating digestion, immune responses, and even neurological function. Yogurt, which contains prebiotic microorganisms such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lactic+acid+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lactic acid bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and bifidobacteria, has been known to modulate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; and provide a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, researchers at Kyushu University focused on Japanese &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hot+springs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hot springs&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Onsen. "We have previously reported the beneficial effects of onsen bathing on the gut microbiota. However, little has been known about how the combination of diet and onsen bathing influences health," says Professor Shunsuke Managi of Kyushu University's Urban Institute, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, we collaborated with Beppu City here in Kyushu, a region well known for its onsen, to investigate the effects of onsen bathing after yogurt intake."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This study enrolled 47 healthy adult men and women who had not bathed in onsens within 14 days prior to the start of the trial. The participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;, a yogurt group, and a yogurt plus onsen group.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group received no intervention, while the yogurt group consumed 180 g of low-sugar yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus after dinner daily. In addition to this, the yogurt plus onsen group bathed in Beppu's chloride spring for more than 15 minutes at least once every two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the four-week intervention period, gut microbiota surveys were conducted using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stool+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stool samples&lt;/a&gt;, and a questionnaire on defecation status containing 14 items which included evaluating stool frequency, stool consistency, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the use of laxatives was administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant increase in gut microbiota diversity in the yogurt group, accompanied by changes in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, these microbial changes were not observed in either the control group or the yogurt plus onsen group. However, both the yogurt group and the yogurt plus onsen group demonstrated significant improvements in defecation status scores, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that yogurt intake may enhance gut microbial diversity, and that its combination with onsen bathing may exert an additive or synergistic effect to improve defecation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the sample size is small, our findings suggest that combining two accessible lifestyle interventions—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/yogurt/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; intake and onsen &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bathing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bathing&lt;/a&gt;—may offer enhanced health benefits, particularly by promoting gut microbiota diversity and improving defecation status in healthy adults," explains Managi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are especially relevant given the growing interest in non-pharmaceutical, lifestyle-based strategies for preventive health and wellness. Furthermore, this research may support the development of evidence-based wellness tourism, particularly in regions known for their onsen, by providing scientific validation for health-oriented travel and services."&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-3e5e8820-7f71-11f0-bca3-b723b3cc772e"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that year, there were 279 congenital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12722117/Rates-syphilis-babies-risen-decade-record-high-CDC-report.html"&gt;syphilis-related stillbirths&lt;/a&gt; and infant deaths. Of those, 252 were stillbirths, an increase of 6.3 percent since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the national congenital syphilis (CS) rate of 105.8 cases per 100,000 live births in 2023 represents a three percent increase from 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing, as well as not following up with treatment after testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13029481/America-std-crisis-syphilis-rates-highest-level.html"&gt;sexually transmitted disease&lt;/a&gt; (STD) screening or treatment also contribute to the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, New York recorded three deaths from CS, but it isn’t the only state with increasing rates of both syphilis and congenital syphilis. The nation’s top five syphilis hot spots include South Dakota, New Mexico, Mississippi, Arizona, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These also have the highest rates of CS per 100,000 live births, according to the most recent CDC data. New York was ranked 40th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third infant death marked the 21st case reported in New York counties this year, excluding New York City. There were 35 cases in New York City in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, New York state officials are calling for mandatory blood test screenings for pregnant mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr James McDonald said in a statement last week: ‘No baby should die from syphilis in New York State or anywhere in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Detecting syphilis early in pregnancy with a simple blood test is important to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment, so you have a healthy baby.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD that causes skin rashes and sores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis is passed from the pregnant mother to the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. There are an estimated 1.5million cases of congenital syphilis each year, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and CS are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. When left untreated, CS can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and afterbirth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a visualization through 2022 of CS cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharon Nachman, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York, told DailyMail.com: ‘The problem is the pregnant patients receiving prenatal care that don’t follow up or show for their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don’t know if you were tested and perhaps tested positive for syphilis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who aren’t screened is another concern. They could be asymptomatic or have no access to STI screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of pregnant women who tested positive did not receive any or adequate treatment, according to new CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only cure for congenital syphilis is the antibiotic benzathine penicillin, which is administered by injection. And it's currently facing a worldwide shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman explained that benzathine penicillin is an older generic drug that is produced less: ‘No new companies want to make benzathine penicillin.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The production of the antibiotic generates unwanted secondary products, such as bacterial residue, which are classified as hazardous waste. These byproducts are toxic and pose risks to the environment and the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a visualization of missed opportunities to detect CS cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘If the byproducts making it are toxic, then even the generic companies won't and don’t want to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘To build a plant that has a byproduct that is difficult to get rid of, and the medicine you are making costs pennies, then there is no profit in making it for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman explained that institutions like Stony Brook Hospital have a small amount of the drug and reserve it for pregnant women only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: ‘Any hospital that doesn’t have it on hand reaches out to other hospitals in their network to see if they can ship it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman said: ‘Of course this [shortage] is contributing to women not following up and receiving their medications, so those babies are born with syphilis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis rates are higher in certain racial and ethnic groups. Infectious disease specialist Dr Carla Garcia Carreno of Children’s Health of Dallas, Texas, told DailyMail.com: ‘Over the years we have seen that the African American population is the most affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There may be some decreased access to contraceptive methods for that particular population.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are in American Indians, Alaska Natives, Black and Hispanic populations, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barriers like limited healthcare access, lack of preventative resources, limited insurance, and trouble reaching testing sites fuel the increase in cases among these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman stressed that pregnant moms aren't the only ones who should be STD screened. Their partners risk syphilis reinfection, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Remember testing pregnant women is only part of the battle. If you don’t test and treat their partners too, they can certainly get reinfected.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:40:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>性忠告：我丈夫和朋友一起出轨了。它使我们的性生活比以往任何时候都更好。- Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOa05kd29WcEdzR2Fhci1aOG1UeUhvdDNxcUxxbS1wOWVsVE5BQXljb3E0Q3dlZFA2WmxveV9XakV2cTdHa3hqb0RjMURTaGZkNEUwdWd3eTk5U2xlZWlPS2FCOXdzT0tEU2d5d1YwcFdHRE5YS2FCQzJ5c0hfVzE5VFd4cy0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj3e001i3b6j8iiulabp@published"&gt;I am married and I have a close friend that is single. The other night, my husband, my friend, and I were drinking at my house. I had enough to drink and I told my friend I was sleepy. She told me to go to sleep. She did not have to tell me twice, I got up and went to bed and left her with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj3y001n3b6j17q3ig9q@published"&gt;Later, I woke up and lay in bed. I could hear noises, like moaning and heavy breathing on the other side of the wall. I just listened and did not move. I realized I was turned on by this. It stopped, and my husband walked into our room to check on me. He goes out again and I can hear the noises again. Before this, my sexual drive for my husband was out. But now every time we get together I’m aroused again. What he and my friend did was wrong and I am not sure how many times they have done this with me knocked out in the other room. But it has also made a difference in our sex life. I have not confronted him or my friend, who by the way I work with. I have thought about just calling him out and not saying anything to my friend because this would impact our relationship at work.&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds like you’d like to indulge more in the &lt;a href="https://www.victoriamilan.com/landers/cuckquaen-guide/"&gt;cuckquean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, which involves deriving sexual pleasure by watching (or hearing) your partner have sex with others. It can be a form of voyeurism and it’s a pretty common sexual fantasy. This practice can include encouraging your partner to pursue it actively, or it can be just one that you participate in alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj42001r3b6jyackk8bd@published"&gt;You can pursue &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-voyeurism#when-it-becomes-a-problem"&gt;voyeurism responsibly&lt;/a&gt; by watching porn and role-playing, but it crosses the line when someone has not consented to be involved. While it’s sexy to hear your husband doing someone else, how would the other woman feel if she didn’t know someone was listening in for their own sexual enjoyment?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj5400273b6jooi9cp8l@published"&gt;Before confronting your husband, think about what you’d like to address. Is it the fact that he cheated and slept with your friend? Do you want an explanation? Or is it that you know and would like him to continue this behavior (with consent from all parties) but with more structure and rules, for example, a rule stating he can’t sleep with your co-workers? Know what resolution you’re looking for—setting some boundaries will make it less likely he’ll run to your friend, which can prevent the very awkwardness you’re trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4t00203b6jehguuges@published"&gt;Last year, we moved into a new house with excellent water pressure. Like almost pressure washer pressure. And using the handheld showerhead, I’ve found that extremely hot, extremally focused water jets spraying on my testicles is one of the most intense pleasurable experiences of my life. It’s not orgasmic, per se, but it feels really, really good - the point I kind of zone out and lose track of time. I know this is bad for my water bill, but my question is more basic: How do I recreate this sensation in the bedroom? My wife and I are approaching 20 years of marriage, and while we have a good sex life, it’s not particularly adventuresome. Shower sex is likely not in the scenario. Any advice? Toys? I feel like finding a solution for this problem will be helping me not only have a more pleasurable experience, but will also be good for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

Or consider the &lt;a href="https://www.womanizer.com/us/womanizer-wave"&gt;Womanizer Wave showerhead&lt;/a&gt; which claims to reduce water use by 60 percent, though that won’t help you out in the actual bedroom but might get at some of that guilt about wasting water. Friend of the column Sonja Vitow suggests a Waterpik with the tonsil stone attachment. But I’d add a waterproof sheet or mattress protector if you decide to bring it into the bedroom. Or start experimenting with other sensations that your testes might find tantalizing that might not involve water but could include just about any other form of touch you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a problem. Sometimes, when I have an intense orgasm, I have what I can only describe as a brain disconnect after. There have been a couple times when I cannot talk. I will try, but all that comes out is gibberish. I have also had panic attacks. It doesn’t happen every time I have an intense orgasm, but when it does it’s pretty scary. Is this a normal reaction to intense orgasms, or is it something I should be worrying about?&lt;/p&gt;

If it were, it’d have been captured, commodified, and turned into a subgenre of porn already (the closest example to a reference in popular culture that comes to mind is when Missy Elliott said, “Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah” in “Work It”).&lt;/p&gt;

Reinert is a gynecologist in Los Angeles who I reached out to after reading a paper she co-wrote, “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454896?dopt=Abstract"&gt;‘Did You Climax or Are You Just Laughing at Me?’ Rare Phenomena Associated With Orgasm&lt;/a&gt;,” which ran in the Sexual Medicine Reviews journal in 2017 and documents instances of rare peri-orgasmic phenomena reported in medical literature and via colleagues. (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-reminds-us-that-reproduction-still-evades-our-control.html?via=recirc_recent"&gt;Reinert has also contributed to Slate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4q001z3b6j76uewqlg@published"&gt;“Without knowing more about this individual, I can say this: An orgasm involves diverse areas of the brain, and there are a variety of bizarre post-orgasmic phenomenon reported in the medical literature, many of which can be explained by our understanding of bodily representation within the brain, or of the neurochemical changes that occur with orgasm,” Reinert told me via email. “These phenomena are not common, so I wouldn’t describe them as ‘normal,’ but in general they are mostly harmless and just a side effect of how the brain is wired. Sex also raises a person’s heart rate and blood pressure, and can be a trigger for dangerous health events, so it’s important to make sure that weird symptoms are ‘just’ due to orgasm, and are not a sign of a stroke, heart attack, or brain aneurysm, for instance.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4p001y3b6jv7ulezh1@published"&gt;Regarding your panic attacks, which Reinert’s aforementioned paper documents, she said: “Among individuals with a history of panic disorder, it has been reported that many experience panic attacks after orgasm; as with this individual, they do not typically occur with every orgasm, only a small percentage of them. If symptoms are sufficiently bothersome, an affected individual could talk with their doctor about medication to decrease the frequency of panic attacks (but medication side effects might cause more trouble for one’s sex life than did the panic attacks).”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4w00223b6jqizcoa6p@published"&gt;The speech symptoms are more concerning. “They sound like what is called Broca’s aphasia, which can be a sign of a stroke in the part of the brain responsible for production of language,” Reinert wrote. “Since this individual’s symptoms occur only immediately after orgasm and then spontaneously resolve, it’s not likely a stroke, but could be due to a seizure or transient ischemic attack in this brain area. It has been reported that some people experience seizures precipitated by orgasm. I would recommend that this person discuss these symptoms with their doctor and maybe a neurologist, in order to rule out a potentially dangerous underlying medical condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that occupational exposures—especially to plastics, ethylene oxide, phenols, and pharmaceutical agents—may have broader developmental effects beyond autism diagnosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder is typically understood as a neurodevelopmental condition involving a mix of genetic and environmental factors. While previous research has associated prenatal exposure to environmental pollutants with increased autism risk, most of that work has focused on diagnosis itself, not on the range or severity of symptoms children may later experience. This study sought to expand that understanding by examining whether parental occupational exposures to potentially harmful agents before and during pregnancy are associated with the intensity of ASD symptoms and co-occurring developmental difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by former researchers from the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in collaboration with the University of California, Davis, as part of the &lt;a href="https://beincharge.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) study&lt;/a&gt;. Their aim was to test whether parents’ workplace exposure to chemicals might contribute not just to ASD risk but to more severe impairments in communication, cognition, or adaptive functioning in children who are already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My stepson was working with children with autism and we began discussing the spectrum of symptoms that children with autism experience and that little was understood about the causes of autism,” explained study author Erin C. McCanlies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCanlies had worked at NIOSH’s Health Effects Laboratory Division as a research epidemiologist, where she studied the impact of occupational exposures on health. That division was responsible for conducting research on workplace health and safety. She is now retired after &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rfk-jr-autism-environment-research-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the division was eliminated&lt;/a&gt; under the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My job was considering how occupational exposures may result in illness or injury. This led to my thinking about the possible causes behind autism, particularly chemicals and other agents that parents might be exposed to while on the job that could potentially result in autism in their children. To better understand this potential risk I reached out to Dr. Irva Hertz-Picciotto at UC Davis, who was conducting a large study, the CHARGE study, which was designed to evaluate genetics and environmental factors that might be involved in the causes of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 532 children with confirmed ASD diagnoses and at least one parent with complete occupational history. All children were between the ages of 2 and 5 and participated in the CHARGE study, a large case-control investigation of autism and developmental delays in California. Each child’s ASD diagnosis was validated using gold-standard instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents completed extensive surveys about their work histories, including the types of jobs they held and any potential exposures to harmful substances during the “index period”—defined as the three months before conception through the end of pregnancy. Two industrial hygienists reviewed each job entry and assigned exposure ratings to a panel of 16 chemical categories, including disinfectants, solvents, metals, plastics, phenols, and others. These ratings were combined into a cumulative exposure score for each parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess ASD symptom severity, the researchers used a standardized metric called the Calibrated Severity Score (CSS), derived from ADOS-2 results. This score is intended to capture core autism features independently of age or cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the CSS, they evaluated cognitive function using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), adaptive functioning with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), and problem behaviors with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). These instruments provided a broader picture of each child’s developmental profile, allowing the team to examine how parental exposures might be linked to different aspects of a child’s functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that workplace exposures to several specific chemical classes were associated with worse outcomes in children with ASD. One of the strongest and most consistent patterns involved plastics and polymer chemicals. Fathers’ exposure to plastics was associated with lower scores across all cognitive and adaptive skill domains, including language, motor coordination, daily living skills, and overall functioning. When both parents were exposed, the deficits appeared to compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised how strongly and consistently plastics and polymers stood out as being linked with multiple developmental and behavioral outcomes including irritability, hyperactivity, and daily living,” McCanlies told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to ethylene oxide—commonly used in hospital sterilization—was also linked to more severe autism symptoms, lower expressive language abilities, and poorer adaptive functioning. Similarly, parental exposure to phenol (used in construction, automotive, and some consumer products) and pharmaceuticals was associated with increased ASD severity and more pronounced behavioral challenges, especially hyperactivity and stereotyped behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results do not imply that all children exposed to these chemicals will develop more severe symptoms, the patterns suggest that early life exposure to workplace toxicants may amplify certain developmental difficulties in children who already meet criteria for ASD. The study provides one of the most detailed looks to date at how parental occupation may relate not just to diagnosis, but to variation in how autism is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that certain parental workplace exposures may be related not just to autism, but to worse symptoms and autism behaviors,” McCanlies explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are consistent with past research linking prenatal exposure to chemicals like BPA, phthalates, and metals to developmental delays, behavioral issues, and increased autism risk. The current study builds on that work by identifying specific occupational chemicals that may intensify these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that both men and women should follow recommended safety practices and use protective gear when working with these chemicals,” McCanlies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that workplace safety isn’t just about protecting the worker — it’s also about protecting their future children,” added Hertz-Picciotto, a professor at the UC Davis MIND Institute. “We must consider how workplace chemicals might affect the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest several possible biological mechanisms that could explain these associations. Many of the chemicals studied are known endocrine disruptors or immune-modulating agents, which can interfere with hormonal signaling, neural development, or inflammatory processes during pregnancy. Micro- and nano-plastics, in particular, have been shown in animal studies to cross the placenta and disrupt gene expression in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers strong statistical support for several associations, it is observational in nature and cannot prove causation. Exposure estimates were based on job descriptions rather than direct biological measurements, which may lead to some misclassification. In cases where mothers reported fathers’ job histories, the accuracy of those reports may have varied. Additionally, some chemicals had too few exposures to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to better understand how these exposures affect brain development,” McCanlies noted. “Although we had a fairly large number of families, the number was still too small to see links with less common exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the use of validated diagnostic tools, a large sample, expert-reviewed exposure ratings, and multiple outcome measures adds weight to the findings. The researchers note that misclassification errors in this study would most likely bias results toward the null, meaning the observed associations may underrepresent the true effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next steps would include longitudinal studies investigating workplace environments and specific exposures that affect both mothers and fathers that may be associated with autism and its severity,” McCanlies explained. “Research aimed at understanding the biological mechanisms underlying the link between work exposures and autism and its severity will also be important to confirm plausibility of causation and for developing effective intervention and prevention methods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is unique; there are few studies that have evaluated parent work exposures and autism severity and behaviors,” McCanlies added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2025.114613" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The effects of parental occupational exposures on autism spectrum disorder severity and skills in cognitive and adaptive domains in children with autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Erin C.

The way it works is a multi-step process: Stress hormones can activate a receptor called beta-2 adrenoceptor, which then causes two more molecules to speed up the cancer’s spread. The process is fueled by a gene, HOXC12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta-blockers can turn off this gene — effectively stopping the progression of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication is most commonly prescribed to treat heart and circulatory problems, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains.

TNBC is an aggressive cancer which can be especially challenging to treat and identifying new treatment pathways are important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "We believe further studies are urgently needed to determine if HOXC12 can be used to identify patients who will benefit from beta blocker therapy at the time of diagnosis and stop tumor spread, thus increasing survival rates.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/beta-blockers-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-11795502" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:05:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1LZ1FCa29RbUYzejgwS3E5UnVKQzJJc2NqMEpvazRDSWl2Q01GbmdoSlVkR1NLUFVvZ0toSk9sdG1HSWpWUW0zemlFN3ZnYmpMUnktbnpmcG9tWnZ6Mnp5d2p2Y29yUTNWdktCLTd1VzhOS295Tmc</guid></item><item><title>“隐藏”脂肪正在无声地使您衰老-科学家警告说，一种常见的体形风险最大-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTmJfT0hMRW5HNnp6ZUlmSC1PYkljV09EMl9HLVNmWFM4R05DV1BHb29GTHZoTzZmUkYwOGtsN1doV3M0UlN5dm1TeXpobkRtZVF5dHJzNWVraXhKZjFieXJ1bzRBUzQ4Qzl6UmNHRXctMnZVSm5UMmh2U1NsOFMzOUlRTk0zeHNLSEphQ1YtZ1BaTHI0dkFn0gGcAUFVX3lxTE9XTTl2WUYxd0wxbVpvTl9JeXZ1RDVScVlhRExLb18xeFdRV1RTUGxEang4SVUtYVNRRjVDMEFTY2JaUzlYUFB4a2VXTllQTTZPME5pTGRiQXVtMXNDVkxBMUY0NW9NYnA5OENjV3dEb0dZT3lHTDhMSkcwbGdnZUMyNW9TWU9tMUpkTEctZmJLS054NzZzamJWYmlCVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slim people may still be at risk of a deadly heart attack—because of hidden fat that accelerates ageing of the heart, a major study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dangerous fat—known as visceral fat—builds up deep inside the body, wrapping around the liver, stomach and intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the fat you can see and pinch, it is invisible from the outside, meaning many people who appear slim may still be carrying harmful amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analysed data from more than 21,000 people and found those with higher levels of visceral fat showed signs their hearts and blood vessels were ageing more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests revealed this type of fat also triggered inflammation throughout the body—a process long linked to premature ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the European Heart Journal, also suggest that body shape may be more important than weight alone when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men who carried fat around the belly in an 'apple-shaped' body type were much more likely to show accelerated heart ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, 'pear shaped' women genetically predisposed to storing fat around their hips and thighs—known as gluteofemoral fat—appeared to have healthier, younger hearts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two MRI scans showing a person (left) with more visceral fat (in red) and subcutaeous fat (in blue)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The UK researchers measured the 'bad' fat around their organs by doing several MRI scans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lower-body fat may even help guard against heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that higher oestrogen levels in premenopausal women were linked to slower heart ageing—suggesting the hormone could play a protective role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reach their conclusions, scientists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Medical Sciences in London analysed MRI scans from participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole-body images were used to map the amount and location of fat, while detailed scans of the heart and blood vessels were assessed with artificial intelligence to detect signs of ageing—such as tissue becoming stiff or inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant was then given a 'heart age', which researchers compared with their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Professor Declan O'Regan, from Imperial College London, said: 'We have known about the apple and pear distinction in body fat, but it hasn't been clear how it leads to poor health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that 'bad' fat, hidden deep around the organs, accelerates ageing of the heart. But some types of fat could protect against ageing—specifically fat around the hips and thighs in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also showed that BMI wasn't a good way of predicting heart age which underscores the importance of knowing where fat is stored in the body and not just total body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot, such as severe chest pain, others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The goal of our research is to find ways to increase healthy lifespan. While being active is important, we found that hidden fat could still be harmful even in fit people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team now plans to investigate whether new weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic can target the ageing effects of this hidden fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs, which mimic the hunger-suppressing hormone GLP-1, have already been shown to cut levels of dangerous visceral fat—and could one day help keep the heart younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation added: 'We already know excess visceral fat around the heart and liver can lead to increased blood pressure and high cholesterol, so it is concerning that it could also help to speed up ageing of the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the pattern of fat distribution typically seen in women's bodies is linked to oestrogen, that hormone may be key to future therapies developed to tackle heart ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating a healthier diet and becoming more active can help to reduce visceral fat levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this summer, US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14955169/heart-ageing-faster-body-test.html"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;developed a free online &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that they claim can help you calculate if your heart is aging faster than the rest of your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By utilising data provided by the American Heart Association it can help you better understand how much stress your heart is under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It asks you to enter your sex, age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, whether or not you have diabetes, and if you take medication for blood pressure or statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also requires you to input your eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) which is used to measure how well your kidneys are functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The age calculator was tested on more than 14,000 US adults between the ages of 30 and 79 from the year 2011 up until 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t stop scrolling on TikTok? Tossing and turning through the night? Feel like you’re glued to the mattress when that 7:00 a.m. alarm starts ringing? We get it, and so does &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Ozlo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not the only person with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sleepproducts+nypsot&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1070US1070&amp;amp;oq=sleepproducts+nypsot&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyCggFEAAYgAQYogQyCggGEAAYogQYiQUyBggHEEUYQNIBCDM0MzFqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep struggles&lt;/a&gt;. About 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders, and 1 in 3 adults do not regularly get the recommended amount of uninterrupted sleep, according to a study published by the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/sleep-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a personal problem. The rise of the “sleep divorce” speaks for itself; people are taking their slumber to separate rooms just to get some peace and quiet. With back-to-school around the corner (hello, roommates and exhausted parents), sleep may feel more important than ever. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More people are turning to sound-masking technology — like &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Ozlo Sleepbuds&lt;/a&gt;. These tiny buds were developed by former Bose engineers to block our real-life noise, whether it’s highway traffic, rowdy roommates, a snoring husband, or your buzzing brain. Best of all? Just in time for the start of the school year, Ozlo is offering $35 off a pair of their &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;best-selling buds&lt;/a&gt;, plus a free gift with your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in biometric sensors to detect when you fall asleep — and when it’s time to dim the noise that your streaming (via Bluetooth)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Comes with four sizes of soft silicone tips that are comfortable for most sleepers and stay secure in the ear, per many reviewers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wireless range of up to 10 feet from the included Smart Case&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Effectively blocks out sleep-disturbing noise, per many reviews&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One-year warranty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires frequent charging (10 hours of playback per charge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Ozlo, Sleepbuds might just give you the best sleep of your life. These little earbuds aren’t just designed to block out descriptions; they also replace the unwanted noise with what you want to stream (think a meditation or perhaps a podcast). Built-in biometric sensors detect when you nod off, automatically switch to soothing sleep sounds when you fall asleep. Pick from four ultra-soft silicone tips designed for all-night comfort, even if you sleep on your side. Sleepbuds are made for everyone, but personalized to your preferences. Whether you’re a lifelong light sleeper or just struggling to tune out noisy neighbors, these tiny buds have you covered. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hailed as a “miracle of engineering,” Sleepbuds pack advanced features into a tiny design to enhance your sleep. They offer 10 hours of battery life, biometric sensing, and Bluetooth streaming, so you can unwind with your favorite audiobook or meditation, fall asleep against soothing sounds designed by scientists, and wake gently with a personal in-ear alarm that won’t disturb your partner.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“After two years of sleeping with a partner who uses a CPAP and always feeling tired, now I say my goodnights, put in my sleep buds with waves, and don’t hear a thing until the alarm goes off in the morning! Life changer!” one happy reviewer exclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that can help maintain or restore the natural balance of your gut microbiota. “They produce enzymes that aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients such as vitamins and minerals,” says nutritionist Staci Gulbin. “If eaten on a regular basis, they can help support weight management through appetite control and can also help prevent gastrointestinal symptoms like antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which is a result of the disruption of gut bacteria balance."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They’re often consumed in supplement form, but getting them directly from fermented foods is an even better way to ingest a wide variety of microorganisms for a broader set of health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-difference-between-probiotics-and-fermented-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What's the Difference Between Probiotics and Fermented Foods? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While both probiotic-rich foods and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/pickling-vs-fermenting-8584423" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; provide similar benefits for your microbiome, they are slightly different. Probiotics are live organisms that are well-studied for their health benefits, with specific strains identified as the beneficial ones. On the other hand, fermented foods are produced through microbial growth (often involving lactic acid bacteria), but those bacteria may or may not have survived the process to make it into the food (for example, your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1554261/sourdough-boules" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sourdough bread&lt;/a&gt; does not contain live organisms). Therefore, the probiotic potential of fermented foods varies, and the types of live organisms they might contain are broader.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Many of the live, active cultures in fermented foods are not present in large enough amounts or have not been tested for specific health benefits to meet the definition of probiotics,” explains nutritionist Toby Amidor. Still, they are greatly beneficial for your digestive health and immune system, and some say even more beneficial than probiotics.

It contains live cultures of bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt;, which help digest lactose and promote gut health, says Amidor. "Greek yogurt is a nutrient-rich food that contributes essential nutrients such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid (B5), and riboflavin (B2). It's a great way to consume probiotics, even for those living with lactose intolerance," she adds. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all yogurt is created equal:&lt;/strong&gt; Some yogurt does not contain live cultures, so read the label if you’re looking to get those probiotic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir, yogurt’s highly drinkable and more sour cousin, is a fermented dairy drink with a more diverse array of probiotics compared to yogurt. “It’s made with two types of fermentation. The fermentation of sugar via natural milk sugar known as lactose (lactic acid fermentation), and the fermentation of yeast via kefir grains (alcoholic fermentation)," says Amidor, pointing out that this provides kefir with a variety of live and active cultures, aka the "good bacteria."

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kimchi, a Korean fermented dish most often made with cabbage, is packed with probiotic lactic acid bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Leuconostoc&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Weissella&lt;/em&gt;, which play a crucial role in supporting gut health. Scientific studies link kimchi’s probiotics to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-boosting effects, contributing to weight management, digestion, and overall wellness when included regularly in the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another traditional pickled cabbage dish, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1154538/quick-sauerkraut" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; hails from Eastern Europe. Just like kimchi, sauerkraut is packed with lactic acid bacteria and fiber, notes nutritionist Lauren Manaker. While these fermented vegetables don’t always contain the clinically defined probiotics, Gulbin points to studies showing that kimchi and sauerkraut have "anti-inflammatory properties that can improve markers of metabolic and heart health," making them greatly beneficial.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both miso and tempeh are fermented soybean products that have been consumed in Asia for hundreds of years and have amazing probiotic benefits thanks to the live cultures introduced into these foods by the fermentation process. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Miso&lt;/a&gt; is a seasoning paste that is most often used to create flavorful soups and broths, while tempeh comes in a firm patty-like form and can serve as a great high-protein meat substitute. If using miso for its probiotic benefits, be sure to look for the unpasteurized version.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If a cheese has been aged but not heated afterward, there’s a good chance it contains live microorganisms.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not really! Our experts recommend favoring probiotics through food over supplements because probiotic-rich foods come with additional nutrients like calcium, potassium, and fiber, which altogether support health. “Although some probiotic supplements can provide prebiotics to nourish probiotic microorganisms, if at all possible, try to consume probiotics through fermented foods," says Gulbin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies suggest that probiotics consumed within fermented foods may have different, more potent effects compared to supplements, possibly influencing immune function differently, notes Amidor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-often-you-should-eat-probiotic-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Often You Should Eat Probiotic Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is no standardized "dose" for probiotics in foods, but Manaker advises aiming for at least one serving of probiotic-rich foods daily, such as a cup of yogurt or a small portion of kimchi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Consistency is key for maintaining gut health.” For dairy products, consuming about three servings per day is generally recommended, says Amidor, with Greek yogurt and kefir excellent options to enjoy regularly.&lt;br&gt;

It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults. In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, new research offers a hopeful twist toward the prevention of this type of cancer: adding just 40 to 60 grams daily of cruciferous vegetables can reduce colon cancer risk by 20-26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large review &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published in BMC Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; analyzed nearly 640,000 individuals and highlights how a simple dietary habit (think of including a few vegetables in your regular diet) could deliver big preventive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed 17 large studies, involving over 639,500 people, among whom 97,595 had colorectal cancer. The results? People consuming the highest amounts of cruciferous vegetables (think broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts) had a 20-26% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those eating the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that consuming around 40-60 grams daily was associated with a 20% lower risk of colon cancer. However, benefits plateaued beyond 60 grams; so more isn't necessarily better. These vegetables are rich in phytochemicals such as flavonoids, fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and glucosinolates, which break down into protective agents like sulforaphane when crushed or chewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why (and how) these vegetables work against colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous vegetables are nutritional powerhouses packed with fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids. But their true anti-cancer star is sulforaphane, a compound produced when these veggies are chopped or chewed. Sulforaphane and related compounds called glucosinolates kickstart the body’s detox systems, reduce inflammation, and repair cellular damage – key elements in cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the broader picture, other research supports different parts of the plant-based diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based dietary patterns overall showed a 46% reduced risk of colon cancer and 73% lower risk of rectal cancer in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhpn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41043-024-00605-4" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/ask-the-dietitian-get-your-facts-right-on-fiber-and-whole-grains/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, whole grains may lower colorectal cancer risk by around 17%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add broccoli to your daily diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli, amongst all cruciferous vegetables, is a nutritional powerhouse, offering a wide range of health benefits due to its rich content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Apart from potentially helping with cancer prevention, broccoli may help with heart health and digestive health, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple ideas on how to incorporate cruciferous vegetables into your regular diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Aim for 40-60g daily:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roughly half a cup of chopped broccoli or its equivalent of cruciferous veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cook smartly:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light steaming preserves key compounds like sulforaphane while enhancing absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add color and variety:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rotate among broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and kale for broader benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pair with a balanced diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus on whole grains, pulses, and fruits while reducing red and processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stay consistent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are preventive strategies best practiced daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re looking to add some goodness to all your meals, then you can consider stirring steamed broccoli into omelets or scrambled eggs for breakfast, or tossing chopped cabbage or kale into salads or wraps for lunch. For dinner, think of adding cauliflower florets to stir-fries or pasta dishes. In fact, you can also build a healthy snacking habit by munching on roasted Brussels sprouts or kale chips. Aiming for half a cup daily means just one thoughtful inclusion per meal. That small shift can be a big deal for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, no food is a magic cure, but adding more cruciferous vegetables to your plate, especially in the range of 40-60 grams daily, can significantly reduce your colorectal cancer risk by around 20%. Combined with other healthy habits, such as screening, exercise, and a rich variety of plant-based foods, you’re setting yourself up for stronger, more vital living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember: Every chopped floret counts. A little broccoli today could go a long way toward a healthier tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study shows new links between high fat diets, colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学支持的“内疚快乐” ，可降低糖尿病、癌症、心脏病甚至死亡的风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOTHppNFVZNWRLRngwSFZ4OGtGdEhXWU8xTGozWFRfXy1jVXJaUzJJdGZwbTRnclV6eENvQUdyajZRRm9LelU2Wlo3RFBzRTNKbEhncmVHODFFT2pLSHA5Y0huYmtCM1BmZE50Q1Zmb0MtSllhdVd4VzZpVHg5dFlDT2dHZl93SGVyTU5CQ2hrWnNZNDQ5bDhPaWZkOExZdGhMVUVyLVVhTVYyLXR3SlI2TG5oYTVyX0tnOHlUZm9FZ9IBxAFBVV95cUxNOW16dGcyME8xcFB5aVFjbWdTS2FzZXoxZzVoMXJDajRnNGM2Y0dpMXRyMDEwR1pqekhMWkZEYmxBanE0cUJva3hQZlJkQ08xNWkydldWRnFBRXFkRnJLQ1pKUjZxNzVHTUh0WU9jLTdac0hFd3pHSHNaSGl2TExnSmMzWmZ1UldLazk3WDJLTDlpSS1NeHhBTzJSR09UU0NmckNUT3IwNVNVN0dfZDJCdU9Jc0Uxb1V2MjFLYS1iNFFxdXZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine don’t have to be guilty pleasures. In fact, they could help you live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to what makes them healthy are flavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antioxidants reduce negative impacts of harmful environmental exposures like smoke and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13743447/health-benefits-sunlight-gloomy-uk.html"&gt;ultraviolet radiation&lt;/a&gt;, while anti-inflammatories can reduce body-wide inflammation associated with obesity, heart disease, arthritis and other chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have long-known these compounds can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14997549/Harvard-doctor-reveals-trendy-drink-kill-cancer-cells-instantly.html"&gt;reduce the risk of chronic disease&lt;/a&gt;. But a new first-of-its kind study found getting a variety of flavonoids from different foods is better than just consuming large amounts from one source - and could reduce your risk of death by 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study tracked the volume and variety of flavonoids consumed by 124,805 participants between the ages of 40 and 70, accounting for sociodemographics, lifestyle, diet and medical risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Benjamin Parmenter, research fellow at Edith Cowan University in Australia, said: ‘Different flavonoids work in different ways, some improve blood pressure, others help with cholesterol levels and decrease inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This study is significant as the results indicate that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity [of flavonoids] has the potential to lead to a greater reduction in ill health than just a single source.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine are flavonoid-rich foods that can be incorporated into a healthy diet (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine are just two examples of high-flavonoid foods that can be part of a healthy diet and should be consumed along with other flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, such as tea, apples, berries, oranges and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with chronic inflammatory illnesses like obesity stand to benefit the most from a varied, high-flavonoid diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When consumed through food, flavonoids have essentially no risk of negative effects. Flavonoid toxicity is only possible by taking too many high-potency supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Nature, tracked diets using information from the UK biobank, a large, population-based cohort study that records biological data over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants filled out the Oxford WebQ 24-hour dietary questionnaire up to five times over the course of three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the dates and causes of participants’ deaths and hospital admissions to determine the relationship between their diets and their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found people who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, characterized as consuming an additional 6.7 flavonoid types per day, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had a 20 percent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and an eight percent lower risk of cancer when compared to those who ate the lowest variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But quantity is still important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Red wine is a date night staple, but it's also one of the richest sources of flavonoids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study who consumed about 500mg of flavonoids per day had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced by nine percent; type 2 diabetes reduced by 12 percent; and respiratory disease reduced by 13 percent when compared to people who ate just 230 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Flavonoid intake of around 500 milligrams a day was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality,’ according to Dr Parmenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That's roughly the amount of flavonoids that you would consume in two cups of tea,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 5oz glass of red wine on average contains about 130 milligrams of flavonoids.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of lipids - fat molecules that perform many essential functions in the body - in the blood found there was a noticeable loss of unsaturated fats, such as those that contain omega fatty acids, in the blood of women with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists found no significant difference in the same lipid molecule composition in men with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy men, which suggests that those lipids have a different role in the disease according to sex. Fats perform important roles in maintaining a healthy brain, so this study could indicate why more women are diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published on August 20 in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association by scientists from King's College London and Queen Mary University London, is the first to reveal the important role lipids could have in the risk for Alzheimer's between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Cristina Legido-Quigley, from King's College London, said: "Women are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer's Disease and are more often diagnosed with the disease than men after the age of 80. One of the most surprising things we saw when looking at the different sexes was that there was no difference in these lipids in healthy and cognitively impaired men, but for women this picture was completely different. The study reveals that Alzheimer's lipid biology is different between the sexes, opening new avenues for research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists took plasma samples from 841 participants who had Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitively health controls and and were measured for brain inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used mass spectrometry to analyze the 700 individual lipids in the blood. Lipids are a group of many molecules. Saturated lipids are generally considered as 'unhealthy' or 'bad' lipids, while unsaturated lipid, which sometime contains omega fatty acids, are generally considered 'healthy'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists saw a steep increase in lipids with saturation - the 'unhealthy lipids' - in women with Alzheimer's compared to the healthy group. The lipids with attached omega fatty acids were the most decreased in the Alzheimer's group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the scientists say there is a statistical indication that there is a causal link between Alzheimer's Disease and fatty acids. But a clinical trial is necessary to confirm the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Legido-Quigley added: "Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet - through fatty fish or via supplements. However, we need clinical trials to determine if shifting the lipid composition can influence the biological trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Asger Wretlind, first author of the study from King's College London, said: "Scientists have known for some time that more women than men are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. The results are very striking and now we are looking at how early in life this change occurs in women."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK says: "In the UK, two in three people living with dementia are women. This could be linked to living longer, or other risk factors like social isolation, education, or hormonal changes from the menopause being at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet could have a role. Future research should also be carried out in a more ethnically diverse population to see if the same effect is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice. Alzheimer's Research UK is proud to be funding this work that will bring us a step closer to a cure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by funding from LundbeckFonden and Alzheimer's Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;
