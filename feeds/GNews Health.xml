			&lt;p&gt;Current medical screening techniques could be failing to catch nearly half of those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;experience a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, according to new research, suggesting many of the millions of heart attacks that happen each year could be prevented with improved methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;heart attack risk&lt;/a&gt; is typically assessed according to a set of criteria such as an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (&lt;a href="https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3398/ascvd-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease-2013-risk-calculator-aha-acc"&gt;ASCVD&lt;/a&gt;) score, which measures factors linked to the development of cardiovascular disease. Patients are then monitored or treated if their scores exceed a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the US and Canada gathered the health records of 465 people 65 years or younger who had been treated for their first heart attack between January 2020 and July 2025 at one of two US medical centers. The data included details such as medical history, blood pressure, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-melatonin-bad-for-your-heart-an-expert-explains-the-new-findings"&gt;Is Melatonin Bad For Your Heart?

An alternative set of criteria, called a predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events (&lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-calculator"&gt;PREVENT&lt;/a&gt;) score, fared even worse: 61 percent of the patients would have been classified as low or borderline risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research shows that population-based risk tools often fail to reflect the true risk for many individual patients," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/current-heart-attack-screening-tools-are-not-optimal-and-fail-to-identify-half-the-people-who-are-at-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Amir Ahmadi, a cardiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we had seen these patients just two days before their heart attack, nearly half would not have been recommended for further testing or preventive therapy guided by current risk estimate scores and guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185059" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ASCVDChart.jpg" alt="ASCVD chart" class="wp-image-185059 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ASCVDChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ASCVDChart-520x675.jpg 520w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ASCVDChart-600x779.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185059" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The ASCVD score could be missing people who will soon experience a heart attack. (Mueller et al., &lt;em&gt;JACC Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, the ASCVD score is calculated during annual check-ups for those aged between 40 and 75. It determines the risk of a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for"&gt;or stroke&lt;/a&gt; within the next 10 years based on contributing factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, age, sex, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those identified as being at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack – high risk being a 20 percent or higher chance of an incident over the next decade – are typically put on preventative measures &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/statins-could-reduce-dementia-risk-even-in-people-with-low-cholesterol"&gt;such as statins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that more needs to be done to better assess heart attack risk in groups without any symptoms – &lt;span&gt;people who wouldn't have been flagged &lt;/span&gt;by these current tools – perhaps by actually testing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;for signs of atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (the fatty plaques in the arteries that obstruct blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we look at heart attacks and trace them backwards, most heart attacks occur in patients in the low or intermediate risk groups," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/current-heart-attack-screening-tools-are-not-optimal-and-fail-to-identify-half-the-people-who-are-at-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anna Mueller, an internal medicine resident at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights that a lower risk score, along with not having classic heart attack symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath, which is common, is no guarantee of safety on an individual level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research needs to be put in some context: the case histories of only a few hundred people were analyzed retrospectively, and PREVENT scores &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.067626"&gt;have shown promise&lt;/a&gt; in detecting heart attack risk in large groups of people, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, those scores also seem to miss people who don't present with typical symptoms or risk factors, according to the researchers. If better, more personalized approaches can be found, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; can be spotted and prevented earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study suggests that the current approach of relying on risk scores and symptoms as primary gatekeepers for prevention is not optimal," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/current-heart-attack-screening-tools-are-not-optimal-and-fail-to-identify-half-the-people-who-are-at-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ahmadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.102361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It puts beyond doubt the dangers associated with using these devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Northwestern Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco wanted to better understand the relationship between indoor tanning and cancer development, particularly with these machines rising in popularity among younger generations. &lt;a class="Link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1790352" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that there are more tanning salons in Florida than McDonald's outlets, and that up to 40% of teenage girls and 20% of 18- to 29-year-olds have used one of these devices in the previous 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the medical records of 32,315 patients seen by the Dermatology service at Northwestern University, with 7,474 of these individuals having reported tanning bed usage. The extent of use was detailed in 2,932 patients, which formed the study's “epidemiological case” cohort. Then, for a control cohort, the researchers randomly selected 2,925 people from the 24,841 patients with no history of tanning bed usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that melanoma was diagnosed in 5.1% of indoor tanners compared with 2.1% of non-users. After adjusting for variables – age, sex, sunburn and family history – tanning bed use resulted in a 2.85-fold increase in melanoma risk. These users were also more likely to develop skin cancers on parts of their body that had rarely been exposed to sun, such as the lower back and buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In outdoor sun exposure, maybe 20% of your skin gets the most damage,” said study first author Dr. Pedram Gerami, professor of skin cancer research at Northwestern University. “In tanning bed users, we saw those same dangerous mutations across almost the entire skin surface.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving further, the team conducted single-cell DNA sequencing on the pigment-producing skin cells where melanoma originates, known as melanocytes, from three donor groups. Group one featured 11 patients with a long history of using tanning beds. Group two included nine patients who had never used one but matched for age, sex and cancer risk. And group three featured skin from six cadavers as further controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is where it got really interesting – and somewhat frightening. With 182 individual melanocytes sequenced, the researchers quickly noticed that the cells of indoor tanners contained almost twice the number of mutations as the control samples, and these changes were more likely to be melanoma-linked ones. And the damage was more likely to be in those shielded-from-the-sun areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even in normal skin from indoor tanning patients, areas where there are no moles, we found DNA changes that are precursor mutations that predispose to melanoma,” said Dr Gerami. “That has never been shown before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the melanomas they develop are much like those seen in people who have inherited a genetic risk of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Young tanning bed users, without a family history of melanoma, periodically develop multiple melanomas on body sites that receive low cumulative sun damage," the team noted. "The presentation of tanning bed-induced melanomas is reminiscent of familial melanoma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanning beds first hit the US market in the 1970s, and by the mid-2010s, had grown into a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516000048" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;US$3-billion-a-year industry&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2013, an estimated 7.8 million women and 1.9 million men in the US hit the "sunbed" each year, usually frequently. According to the World Health Organization, tanning beds are are a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.compoundchem.com/2023/07/14/carcinogens/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there is sufficient scientific evidence that they cause cancer in humans. (Smoking, alcohol and processed meats are also in this group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you buy a pack of cigarettes, it says this may result in lung cancer,” he said. “We should have a similar campaign with tanning bed usage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;
            &lt;div class="Enhancement-item"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the FDA attempted to ban people under the age of 18 from using tanning beds and require all adults to sign a consent form acknowledging that they know the risks that come with this specific ultraviolet light exposure. But 10 years on the responsibility has fallen to state and local governments to restrict or ban the service. California was the first state to ban indoor tanning for minors in 2012, and since then, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.skincancer.org/blog/indoor-tanning-legislation-heres-stand/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;43 more states have banned or at least restricted tanning bed use&lt;/a&gt; for those under 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia, which has the highest rate of melanoma in the world, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://melanoma.org.au/about-melanoma/melanoma-facts/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;banned the use of tanning beds&lt;/a&gt; outright in 2015, but it wasn't the first country to do so. Brazil banned cosmetic indoor tanning in 2009, but allows it for some medical conditions. It's worth noting that the tanning bed industry lobby in these countries was relatively small at the time of the bans – however, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5710080/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;both Europe and the US have powerful lobby groups&lt;/a&gt; fighting more US restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the high levels of mutational damage in skin cells from tanning bed users, it is difficult to justify marketing claims that the spectra of UV radiation in tanning beds are safer than natural sunlight," the study's researchers concluded. "Another popular claim by tanning advocates is that a pre-vacation tan can photoadapt skin in anticipation of recreational sun exposure. However, we see that tanning bed usage raises the mutation burden and risk of melanoma particularly in skin cells that receive low cumulative sun damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tanning bed exposures are often thought of as a substitute for natural UV radiation despite differences in the maximum doses, UV content, body sites exposed, and patterns of melanoma that arise," they said. "Our work highlights unique ways in which tanning beds shape the mutational landscapes of skin cells, helping to explain the distinctive presentations of melanoma in this patient population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma – the deadliest type of skin cancer – kills an estimated 11,000 people in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady4878" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a class="Link" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/tanning-beds-triple-melanoma-risk-potentially-causing-broad-dna-damage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One week later, the researchers compared the viral 'trails'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scans revealed areas of the brain associated with sensory processing became more connected with the part of the brain that takes action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, connections within the cortex, where &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/CABN.10.4.470"&gt;negative thought feedback loops take place&lt;/a&gt; in humans, were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang and team also found that brain activity seems to direct where psilocybin rewiring occurs, opening the prospect of using methods like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-certain-type-of-magnetic-stimulation-could-help-the-brain-remember"&gt;magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; to modulate targeted neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings still need to be confirmed in humans, as not all findings from research in mice &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-develop-in-unique-ways-that-explain-some-mysteries-left-by-mice-models"&gt;translate across species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the results would explain some of the results of human observation studies, and one of the most compelling ideas about how psychedelics work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study hints at an exciting avenue for future research to combine neuromodulation with psychedelics to precisely target [and rewire] specific circuits," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.009"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.009"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol. The boxed warning, FDA's most serious type, cautions that drinking while taking the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, have been limited. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval “reflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women’s sexual health is understood and prioritized.” The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug's modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

So, how to stay healthy for the next two weeks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8198acdb-d59d-4a90-8324-fb0c6ee0fca4" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;1. Do we really need to wear a mask?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some hospitals have already reinstated masks for staff, patients and visitors and, while the guidance remains advisory rather than compulsory for people with flu symptoms, a glance around buses and trains confirms that some are taking it seriously. Asked whether people who are coughing and spluttering with a cold should wear a mask to the office, Elkeles said: “I think that would be very sensible to all their colleagues, or probably their colleagues would say, ‘Please go home.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Baumgardt says some research has shown protection against viruses is enhanced when masks are worn consistently, but, as we all remember from lockdown, it needs to be the right sort of mask, positioned in the right way on your face and coupled with other measures such as personal hygiene. “You see a lot more people pulling their scarf around their face or their coat collar up at the moment, which won’t really have much effect,” Baumgardt says. “The best way to prevent the spread of a virus is still by washing your hands or using antibacterial gel, but your body also needs rest, so it is wise to take it easy and stay at home.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flu-hospitalisations-record-level-nhs-wes-streeting-0xrbkmcd5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wes Streeting: NHS risks collapse from strikes threat and ‘superflu’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4bcc92a4-32e6-4cf7-862a-39fc39693965" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;2. It’s not too late to get a flu jab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A mutated version of the flu virus, dubbed H3N2 “subclade K”, is circulating, and experts are predicting the number of people catching it will only rise in the coming weeks. “There are still some flu vaccines available and the NHS has sent out a flu jab SOS,” Baumgardt says. “It is worth asking at your GP or pharmacy if you are eligible and haven’t had one yet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are over 65, or have a weakened immune system, are pregnant or have underlying health issues you should have been invited for a flub jab on the NHS. Vaccines are available privately from high street chemists for about £20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Although not 100 per cent effective, what we have in terms of a vaccine this year offers the best protection available,” Baumgardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ad2617e2-57df-4052-b466-2c97a3ac2b17" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;3. Using a nasal spray could keep colds, flu and chest infections at bay&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Last year a study led by Paul Little, professor in primary care research at the University of Southampton, found that using inexpensive over-the-counter nasal sprays could minimise the chances of getting colds, chest infections and flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a trial funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research and involving more than 13,000 patients around the UK, Little and colleagues from Southampton and the University of Bristol asked patients to use either Vicks First Defence gel-based nasal spray, a saline nasal spray — a mixture of salt and water — or to follow advice online promoting physical activity and stress management. Advice was to use the nasal spray six times a day from the earliest symptoms of a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Results published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine showed that while the exercise and stress advice produced a 5 per cent reduction in symptoms, both varieties of nasal spray — available without a prescription from £4.50 at pharmacies — resulted in a 20 per cent reduction in symptoms and cut the days the illness lasted by a similar percentage. “Given these results, our advice to people is, if possible, at the first sign of cough, sore throat, cold or flu-like symptoms, use a nasal spray to prevent it from developing,” Little says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="23db7f61-de40-41d2-9eb2-e3a532bec8e5" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;4. Suck a peppermint to clear a stuffy head&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is the advice of Professor Andy Smith from Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, who recently published a study in the World Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences showing that peppermints increase alertness in people who feel sluggish with a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Smith says that vapours such as mint have been shown in previous research to have therapeutic benefits, and in tests he has conducted comparing the effects of sucking on peppermints with butterscotch or no sweets at all, peppermints were found to soothe the signals from the body to the brain. “Our results confirmed that mild upper respiratory tract illnesses — the common cold — are associated with slower psychomotor speed and reduced alertness,” Smith says. “But sucking on a peppermint, compared to a butterscotch or nothing, during a cold can increase your alertness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b8c8d635-8fca-4706-af8d-1382bf2ff875" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;5. Take a zinc lozenge only when you get the sniffles or a sore throat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Zinc is needed for immune cells to function and is not stored in the body, so you need a regular supply from sources including meat, poultry, shellfish, nuts and seeds. But unless you are diagnosed with a deficiency, taking a daily zinc supplement long term is not recommended because it can cause an upset stomach and interfere with the absorption of other minerals in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s worth keeping some zinc lozenges on standby, though, because the body’s requirement for it increases when you have an infection such as a cold. “It might help to prevent a cold virus binding to the lining of the nose,” says Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex and author of &lt;i&gt;Immune to Age&lt;/i&gt;. “But small doses of 10-40mg at the first sign of an infection and for a few days are all that is needed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/guide-to-beans-r9jjlspt0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we should eat beans every day — and which are the healthiest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f5ca12db-3581-49e6-806c-da8dc2a39699" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;6. Have some chicken (or turkey) soup to reduce cold symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2025 review by scientists at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) and the University of Adelaide may have proved your grandmother right by confirming that chicken-based soups made with vegetables and herbs “offer modest benefits for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) [such as a cold], particularly for symptom relief and inflammation”. Writing in the journal Nutrients, the lead author, Sandra Lucas, a senior lecturer in the School of Health Sciences at UWS, explains that “soup is thought to support recovery through hydration, warmth, nutritional content, and possible anti-inflammatory effects”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Macciochi says that, in addition to vitamins and minerals that could help to ease mucus and inflammation in the airways, there are beneficial substances in chicken or turkey soup that might further combat a cold. “These include carnosine, which supports immune cells, and properties released as poultry is cooked that resemble the drug acetylcysteine that is prescribed for respiratory ailments,” Macciochi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5e784be8-a09d-48b1-852f-ad23e2809083" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;7. Try bouillon for your hangover&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Drink more than your liver can metabolise and you cannot expect to avoid a hangover — however, there are strategies to reduce the symptoms of a dry mouth and thumping head. From probiotics and milk thistle extract to recovery patches, each festive season brings a new remedy promising to spare us from the suffering of overindulgence. Do any of them really work, though? It’s unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2022 review by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London looked at 21 published trials of clove extract, red ginseng, Korean pear juice and other hangover cures and found that, while some did show statistically significant improvements in symptoms, all evidence was of very low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.31"&gt;&lt;div id="01f83cb8-5ee0-48ed-ae38-bcbe98416f16"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Drinking bouillon soup, a good source of vitamins and minerals, may help with a hangover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Obviously stopping after one glass of champagne instead of three is the best preventive measure, but if restraint hasn’t worked, rehydration is the next step. “One of the causes of a hangover is dehydration, due to the fact that alcohol has a diuretic effect,” Baumgardt says. “Drinking plenty of water or diluted juice before you go to bed and the next morning is the best way to combat it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eating something the next morning will also help — “a full English works for me,” Baumgardt says, “but a piece of toast is better than nothing” — as it will raise your blood sugar and help you to feel closer to normal. Taking an ibuprofen may ease your thumping head, but doing so is not free from risk, as it can irritate the stomach lining, increasing the risk of stomach bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Things should slowly improve as you rest, eat and drink more,” Baumgardt says. Consider some bouillon soup, a thin, vegetable-based broth, as a good source of vitamins and minerals including &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;alt and potassium, later on. The charity Drinkaware says that even the NHS recommends bouillon as a potential recovery aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="58d62152-6aee-4e69-9e53-9fe27b27c8cf" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;8. If you are going to take a preventive supplement, choose vitamin D over C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unless you are deficient in the first place, taking mega-doses of vitamin C will do little to prevent the risk of catching a winter virus. “A lot of people are obsessed with vitamin C in winter, but a better option for fighting off winter ailments is vitamin D, which carries much more evidence and is one to consider,” Baumgardt says. “The NHS says we should all take a 10mcg supplement during the winter and it will help your immune health.” If you do catch a cold, taking 1-2g vitamin C daily from the first onset of symptoms might help to shorten the worst of it, according to a review of ten published trials by researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="15fbf4cd-fe1f-4514-8aca-7f14fffa1ad3" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;9. Try turmeric for indigestion (but don’t expect miracles)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Most supplements commonly taken to offset the digestive impact of overindulgence won’t have much effect. “Milk thistle and artichoke extract have a big following,” but there’s not much evidence they really help with indigestion or with acid reflux,” says the nutritionist Rob Hobson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study by researchers at Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine in Bangkok in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine did show that turmeric could be as effective as medicine for reducing excess stomach acid and Baumgardt says simple over-the-counter medications such as Rennie are worth keeping in your cabinet. Others, such as Gaviscon, produce a layering effect on top of the stomach and coat the lining of the oesophagus, protecting it from acid and other components of stomach juice. “Of course, not overindulging on rich foods is the best way to avoid after-effects,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQMVU2ZDFoWmxxTHE2eWoxSTV4YkswOGthRElOTXI4Ql9EOXlEUFpjQW8yMzh2cFZaNkQ1QW5sb2lYLTB0U2ZYTzMteVcteHM0clhBRkNtUGtRNEhhRW1tRWlLdGZUZ0otSG4tWGxJV0VDd0xYTHFJQWxkVHdkdUJFYlhBSmZQM0VEZVN0c0Q3MERSYWsySTcyRkxPdXlEQTdwdUFWZk1VTzBoQQ</guid></item><item><title>医生请愿加州禁止与致命疾病有关的台面材料- KQED</title><link>https://www.kqed.org/news/12067166/health-emergency-california-doctors-urge-ban-of-countertop-material-linked-to-deadly-disease</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as this dangerous material remains available and is purchased and used in California, it’s inevitable that people will continue to be exposed and die,” Robert Blink, an occupational medicine doctor in San Francisco and former WOEMA president, told KQED. “There’s always resistance to change. But when you’ve got something this dangerous out there that’s literally killing people … we’ve got to stop this from going up. This is not a time for small measures, frankly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineered stone can contain more than 90% crystalline silica, much more than natural stones such as marble. The factory-made material’s popularity has skyrocketed because it is stain-resistant, produced in attractive colors and designs and is often cheaper than natural stones. But many consumers are unaware of the hazards that artificial stone dust poses to the workers who shape and install their countertops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing scientific evidence has shown that the silica dust released by the material is so toxic that small amounts of exposure are enough to make workers sick. The tiny airborne particles can penetrate filter masks and lodge in the lungs, causing progressive scarring and injury in workers, some as young as their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of silicosis cases have also been reported by doctors in Illinois, Utah, Colorado, Massachusetts, as well as other states that are not tracking the disease as systematically as California’s public health authorities. Those figures are widely believed to be underreported. Israel, Spain and other countries have also seen a surge in silicosis tied to engineered stone. Medical experts in the UK are urging authorities to prohibit the use of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Nevin, an attorney at Brayton Purcell, a firm that represents hundreds of sick workers suing major manufacturers and distributors of artificial stone, said clients are located in 16 other states, including New York, Nevada, Florida, Kentucky and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

Inhaling fine particles can contribute to silicosis. &lt;cite&gt;(Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California currently bans the dry cutting of engineered stone and mandates the use of wet methods — machines that submerge or cover the material’s surface with water to suppress dust. Employers are also required to implement local exhaust ventilation, ensure employees wear powered air-purifying respirators and take other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA inspectors have found most of the 120 shops they’ve visited in the last two years were violating the rules, which fabricators and doctors consider too expensive and challenging for many employers to follow. California has about 4,600 countertop fabrication workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major manufacturers, such as Israel-based Caesarstone, did not immediately return requests for comment on the California ban proposal, but publicly opposed a prohibition in Australia. A spokesperson for Cosentino, a company headquartered in Spain, also declined to comment, but told KQED last month that silicosis is preventable when proper safety and health measures are in place to protect workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies, which face hundreds of lawsuits by workers claiming silica-related injuries in the U.S. and other countries, have developed crystalline silica-free products for the Australian market but continue to sell high-silica engineered stone in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KQED</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 21:16:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxNcjZFN3RMbk5hTFVGUGJSb2tEdG02RDZmMDRJbm42dXg2VGtEX29TU0NQWVJHRnZJQ1dUWVB4elFaYms3d3VtdHh4SWpUNGRzdnhzYmxPTWxVb2ZaYWg2SnpwTDlFOFJVUE45aU9SbmljRUd2VUE2STlxcnhnb2NoWXoyM0lnLTg1Rzl4czlCUDVTZjBfN0JKa1JESXJ2czRpTnRvdm11VVl6YmdQZmZNQzJTUTE4T0E5cVprN2xIOEx5RzVKdHc</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，将血糖降低心脏病风险控制在一半-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/well/blood-sugar-heart-disease-risk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 20:41:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQVHZ5c0swVjd3RGY1MjA4WXRQTHhOYkFqMkkwMm5nWTBUVHV5aFRuQ3ROcTJDeUFMZzM1Z3R6QmcwRS1NcXMySm9LT1JybXVwRl82dTUtclAxTGNyNXVubVIzUEhuN3ZoT1g4bEpjQjFKRHFXUW1Ja1hDaTlNMHBBVQ</guid></item><item><title>FDA允许更年期女性服用增强性欲的药丸-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/women-libido-addyi-pill-fda-sexual-health-a6b34c5c94cb31f5908b200097f983da</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials have expanded approval of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;a much-debated drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aimed at &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-3b04306fd1da48b2bb5d1c56db2ea175"&gt;boosting female libido&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug’s use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7779b97e8bbc44e08827013e528dc1f9"&gt;Addyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;low sex drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addyi, marketed by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-execs-behind-female-libido-pill-have-run-afoul-of-fda-c6bc3317da92422b967fa6ddb8ff73aa"&gt;Sprout Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women’s health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street’s initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval “reflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women’s sexual health is understood and prioritized.” The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug’s modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women’s rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been updated to correct the age range of the FDA approval update. The agency approved the drug for postmenopausal women up to age 65, not older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Importantly, measuring metabolites in urine provides a more objective and accurate reflection of dietary intake than questionnaires alone,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More polyphenols linked to slower heart disease progression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers discovered that although heart disease risk naturally increases as we age, having a higher intake of polyphenol-containing foods was linked to a slower progression of risk over the 11-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although everyone’s risk increased with age, those who consumed more polyphenols, or showed higher metabolite levels, had consistently lower predicted cardiovascular risk.

"The shared genetics between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder pointed us in this direction [as a field]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He agrees with the study authors' conclusion that shared genetics point to shared biological mechanisms. However, Liu noted that the study does not explain why clinical symptoms vary so widely between these disorders, even when the underlying genetics overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an important paper, but still a small step toward understanding the disorders," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-FgS6ZGWRtT4DT6Qu8ew4wc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-FgS6ZGWRtT4DT6Qu8ew4wc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ad78c00b-54d2-4946-afc0-cdfef047e61f" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="genes-aren-t-the-whole-story-3"&gt;Genes aren't the whole story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="50b49f7f-036a-4bdf-8e49-e46a24ca3cc3"&gt;The study showed that many of the genetic variants linked to psychiatric disorders are also linked to other traits, including intelligence; sleep problems like insomnia; personality; social behaviors like aggression; and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not all of these links are negative," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research/researchers/abdel-abdellaoui.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research/researchers/abdel-abdellaoui.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Abdel Abdellaoui&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at the University of Amsterdam who was not involved in the study, wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7563710414162904391&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-03728-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2F5-genetic-signatures-underpin-a-range-of-psychiatric-conditions" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03728-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-03728-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2F5-genetic-signatures-underpin-a-range-of-psychiatric-conditions" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;commentary article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Nature. For example, the genetic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is also associated with traits that can support academic success, such as creativity and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nuance matters because embryos used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) are sometimes screened for psychiatric risk factors, which are measured via the embryo's genetics. Parents-to-be then have the option to select embryos with lower "risk scores" for psychiatric disorders. But this choice isn't necessarily clear-cut, Abdellaoui argued. Carrying certain genetic traits doesn't guarantee a disorder will emerge, and the same genes can influence positive traits, such as creativity or resilience, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="06e2d9db-9437-4f27-9f57-d9dc8f0ea422"&gt;Abdellaoui said psychiatric disorders often appear at the extreme ends of a natural range of genetic variation, especially when combined with certain life experiences. In other words, a person can have a genetic predisposition for a given disorder but not ultimately develop it unless they encounter certain adverse events, whether trauma or environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This should reframe mental illness not as defective biology, but as the unfortunate intersection of natural variation and environmental stress," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2512abef-f81d-42dc-b500-28fc8a35cbb0" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-five-groupings-3"&gt;The five groupings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a629a9a8-2d70-45d5-bd87-d5017a450a93"&gt;To study which genetic variants are unique to each disorder and which are shared across disorders, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/andrew-grotzinger" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/andrew-grotzinger" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andrew Grotzinger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the Institute for Behavior Genetics at the University of Colorado Boulder and his colleagues analyzed genetic information from more than 1 million people who primarily had European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disorders that share many genetic variants were dubbed "genetically correlated." Using these correlations, the scientists found that the 14 disorders fell into five genomic factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-97e592cf-6d35-48ab-868c-a027a8574c9d" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="five-genomic-factors-3"&gt;Five genomic factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul id="e1627388-dc8e-4f08-8e01-7ceabc92d615"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compulsive: Anorexia, OCD, Tourette's&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurodevelopmental: Autism, ADHD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internalizing: Depression, PTSD, anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Substance use: Alcohol, cannabis, nicotine and opioid dependence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schizophrenia-bipolar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="8ca2bcb9-e6ae-4871-955b-03d21932c530"&gt;Each genetic factor showed a unique biological pattern, in terms of how the associated genes behave in the brain. For example, genes linked to the schizophrenia-bipolar factor are strongly active in excitatory neurons, which push other neurons to activate, and in brain areas involved in interpreting reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes linked to the internalizing factor are associated with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain/brain-physiology/types-glia" target="_blank" data-url="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain/brain-physiology/types-glia" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;glia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the brain's support cells. Glia serve as immune protection and maintain connections between neurons, among other roles. This implies that these disorders may relate more to these support cells than to neurons, Abdellaoui said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b4402e03-2b9b-4be2-a75b-532f3ac9b605"&gt;The substance-use factor included gene variants that encode the enzyme responsible for breaking down alcohol, and others that encode the receptors that respond to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu cautioned that these genetic links to psychological disorders should be interpreted carefully. "Genes or biological pathways statistically associated with a disorder should not be interpreted as causal without additional evidence supporting a direct mechanistic role," he said. In short, correlation does not imply causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are multiple alternative explanations for why a gene is associated with a disorder," he said, "or why two disorders exhibit overlapping genetic signals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="baa6c73e-d456-4a2d-8156-544ca3cc735e"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Blinking handles essential eye maintenance, and we usually blink multiple times a minute without thinking much about it, though you might be more self-conscious about your own after the results of a new study on their connection to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-our-brains-always-want-to-solve-problems-by-adding-not-taking-away"&gt;cognitive load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Canada found we tend to blink less when we're listening to someone speak, especially when there's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cant-hear-people-when-its-noisy-a-study-links-this-to-dementia-risk"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know if blinking was impacted by environmental factors and how it related to executive function," &lt;a href="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/12/09/blinking-less-could-signal-the-brain-is-working-harder-to-listen-concordia-study-shows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pénélope Coupal, a psychology researcher at Concordia University in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For instance, is there a strategic timing of a person's blinks so they would not miss out on what is being said?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-blue-eyes-arent-really-blue-and-what-makes-green-so-rare"&gt;Why Blue Eyes Aren't Really Blue (And What Makes Green So Rare)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, the study team conducted two experiments with a total of 49 participants, tracking the number of blinks registered as volunteers heard sentences being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-iq-may-affect-how-well-you-can-hear-speech-study-shows"&gt;read aloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two key variables were adjusted across the experiments: lighting conditions and background noise, making it harder or easier to hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the participants, blink rates dropped noticeably and consistently while the sentences were being read out loud, compared to before and after. When higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-zoo-monkeys-prefer-traffic-sounds-to-the-natural-noise-of-a-jungle"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt; were involved, blink rates dropped further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no significant changes in blinking rates across different lighting conditions, suggesting it was the cognitive effort of understanding speech, rather than visual strain, that influenced blinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though average blink rates between individuals varied, the tendency to reduce the number of blinks per minute was consistent across the group. In line with findings from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135293"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, this suggests we blink less when our brains are working harder to make sense of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't just blink randomly," &lt;a href="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/12/09/blinking-less-could-signal-the-brain-is-working-harder-to-listen-concordia-study-shows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Coupal. "In fact, we blink systematically less when salient information is presented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn't study why thinking and blinking are linked, but they have some ideas. For example, the brain may slow blinking rate so there &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.0828"&gt;are fewer interruptions&lt;/a&gt; to the visual information coming from our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that blinking is associated with losing information, both visual and auditory," &lt;a href="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/12/09/blinking-less-could-signal-the-brain-is-working-harder-to-listen-concordia-study-shows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychology researcher and acoustics engineer Mickael Deroche, from Concordia University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is presumably why we suppress blinking when important information is coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also research to suggest that blinks act as a sort of mental pause for the brain as it processes written sentences or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.02.037"&gt;responds to emotional cues&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequent blinks could be a sign of a brain paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that a similar regulatory mechanism is at play within the auditory system, adapting the principles observed in vision to support auditory processing by optimizing blink timing to reduce disruptions in auditory attention," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23312165251371118"&gt;write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team suggests blink patterns could one day be used as another way of assessing cognitive load and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-quantified-the-speed-of-human-thought-and-its-a-big-surprise"&gt;cognitive processing&lt;/a&gt;, understanding when the brain is busier, and perhaps spotting signs of cognitive issues – similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-speech-trait-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-trial-suggests-hearing-aids-help-reduce-cognitive-decline"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, scientists will need to collect a lot more data to see whether those connections hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be fully convincing," Deroche &lt;a href="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/12/09/blinking-less-could-signal-the-brain-is-working-harder-to-listen-concordia-study-shows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "we need to map out the precise timing and pattern of how visual [and] auditory information is lost during a blink. This is the logical next step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23312165251371118"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trends in Hearing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Importantly, measuring metabolites in urine provides a more objective and accurate reflection of dietary intake than questionnaires alone,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers discovered that although heart disease risk naturally increases as we age, having a higher intake of polyphenol-containing foods was linked to a slower progression of risk over the 11-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although everyone’s risk increased with age, those who consumed more polyphenols, or showed higher metabolite levels, had consistently lower predicted cardiovascular risk. This suggests that people with diets richer in polyphenol-containing foods tend to maintain a more favorable heart-health profile as they age, but again, no causal conclusions can be drawn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Evidence from many randomized controlled trials shows that polyphenols can help blood vessels function better, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and improve &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-lipids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;blood lipid&lt;/a&gt; profiles,” Rodriguez-Mateos continued. “They appear to act through several mechanisms, including boosting &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;nitric oxide&lt;/a&gt; availability in blood vessels, which helps them relax and support healthy circulation.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to run a randomized controlled trial to test whether consuming a diet rich in polyphenol-rich foods can directly improve markers of heart health,” she added. “We are also developing new &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5813875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt;-based tools to measure diet more accurately and better understand how these compounds relate to long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results add to our current understanding of polyphenols as natural compounds with anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; properties that can improve blood vessel function and potentially be beneficial to heart health,” Chen, who was not involved in the research, commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Research into the health effects of our daily diet will go a long way toward helping us control many of the known risk factors for heart disease, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and obesity,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research can further investigate whether some polyphenol-rich foods — such as tea, coffee, and certain nuts/berries — are more beneficial to heart health than others,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, offered her top tips for those who may want to start eating and drinking foods and beverages high in polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I love most is that these benefits come from foods most people already know, such as berries, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/267290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt;, citrus, nuts, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains, herbs, spices, tea, and even &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dark-chocolate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;,” Richard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to overhaul your whole diet — small, consistent shifts toward more plants, as accessible and available, can support your heart, gut, and brain starting today,” she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard explained that people can add more polyphenols to their diet just by adding more plants to their plate. She suggested starting simple with one or two changes a day, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;adding &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/health-benefits-of-berries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt; to breakfast dishes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt; or peppers to egg dishes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tossing beans into soups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sprinkling nuts or seeds onto salads, or having them as a snack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;choosing &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/269538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/292160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;black tea&lt;/a&gt; instead of sweetened or diet soft drinks or syrup-laden coffee beverages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using herbs and spices like &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, oregano, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, or basil, which can be added to soups, casseroles, salads, sandwiches, and in sauteed, grilled, or baked entrees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reaching for fruits like apples, grapes, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/272782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;oranges&lt;/a&gt;, pears, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;pomegranates&lt;/a&gt;, which are “easy-on-the go” snacks or desserts, and are great for the heart and brain, while their fiber and nutrient content supports gut function and the immune system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“And yes, even a square of dark chocolate counts with a handful of nuts can be beneficial while satisfying that afternoon craving,“ said Richard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polyphenol literally means ‘poly’- many, and ‘phenols’—a chemical structure (aromatic ring) in plant compounds that contains a phenyl group,” Richard detailed. “The translation — many protective compounds. Think of polyphenols as nature’s defense molecules — plants make them, and we benefit when we eat them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember that meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can help personalize and tailor your needs to your health goals based on your current health, lifestyle, preferences, activity level, current nutrition status, and more,” she added. “Work with your healthcare team or local search engine to find one that may be a good fit for you and your polyphenol needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:49:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNeURuaktSZ0hKWFRXUjUtdXF1UGgwdmZxbWFkNGtqcXRUcXpHdWhEUDJpR2F1VW5MWHYwQThnTG1ZcjhiSjlMaWlvM0xPTXZYSkhJVXk5NHRNVnN6Mm5HQ01adkZGRDBTZWRsRmluNl9LV2xiZVByRFhmXzVhUklXaTBZR0w4bDlZWk51SGN6YUwyeGpTRFdHRkltY3pfUVpSMmR0cXNnLURuR2ZuRC1GZExqYmNGZw</guid></item><item><title>新出现的“超级流感”菌株正在迅速蔓延。以下是您需要了解的信息- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/emerging-super-flu-strain-is-spreading-fast-heres-what-you-need-to-know-2000699701</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The flu season is picking up pace, new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s looking to be a doozy this winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s surveillance, seasonal flu activity has increased throughout most of the country in recent weeks. Surges of flu have already led to school closures in some areas, while at least one pediatric death has been recorded so far. This season is being driven by a novel variant of H3N2 flu, dubbed subclade K—a variant that our vaccines are ill-equipped against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An emerging, unexpected threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a flu season, multiple variants of influenza A and influenza B viruses will spread between people. Because conventional vaccines take time to produce, public health experts try to predict which flu strains will be circulating up to nine months before flu season starts in each hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This winter, however, subclade K has thrown a wrench into our plans. The variant emerged toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and it’s proven to be genetically different and fit enough to quickly supplant other strains of H3N2 and other flu viruses in general. What’s worse, the seasonal flu vaccine is poorly matched to subclade K, reducing its ability to prevent infection and illness from the strain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The emergence of subclade K already &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.49.2500894"&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; the flu season in parts of the Southern Hemisphere like Australia and New Zealand. It’s also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;jumpstarted&lt;/a&gt; the flu season weeks ahead of schedule in European countries. In the UK, subclade K is currently helping cause a spike of hospitalizations and an “&lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;unprecedented wave of super flu,&lt;/a&gt;” according to NHS officials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s latest data, covering the first week of December, shows that respiratory virus activity in the U.S. is low overall, but this peace likely won’t last long. Flu cases meriting medical care are rising in most parts of the country, with 8.1% of lab tests coming back positive for flu (two weeks earlier, it was 5%). Flu-related hospitalizations also appear to be increasing, and the first pediatric death linked to flu was reported last week. And schools in &lt;a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/mize-elementary-school-cancels-classes-friday-due-to-increase-in-flu-cases/"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-school-district-cancels-classes-tuesday-wednesday-due-to-widespread-illness-moulton-udell/69665507"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; have already had closures due to recent flu outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to do about the flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of new infections in the U.S. are being caused by H3N2, signaling that subclade K is rearing its ugly head here, too. And given what’s happening in other parts of the world, that doesn’t bode well for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, vaccination does remain an important part of staying safer this flu season. Despite the mismatch to subclade K, early UK data has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D."&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the seasonal vaccine is still effective at preventing severe illness from the flu, particularly in kids.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You should also practice good hygiene like regularly washing your hands, try to stay home if you’re sick, and potentially wear a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection (well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 being the most effective).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

It’s called “orthostatic intolerance,” and it’s a relatively common phenomenon among runners, which I’ve always assumed had something to do with being really fit and having a low resting heart rate. But a new study suggests there’s something entirely different going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Penn State and Florida State universities, led by Chester Ray, tested the hypothesis that the up-and-down motion of running causes the motion sensors in your inner ear to become less sensitive—which in turn means they’re slower to detect when you suddenly stand up. Their study, which appears in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41056402/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had sedentary volunteers complete eight weeks of either running, cycling, or no exercise. Sure enough, running had a unique impact on their inner motion sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your inner ear has two main functions: hearing and balance. The balance part, also known as the vestibular system, relies in part on a bunch of rock-like crystals called otoliths, which is Greek for “ear stones.” When your head moves, gravity makes these crystals move around; their motion is detected by small hairs that then signal to your brain which direction and how quickly your head is moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motion-sensing system is important to help you avoid fainting whenever you stand up. As you change your body position, gravity will cause your blood to redistribute itself within your body, tending to pool in your legs when you’re vertical. That can leave insufficient blood—and oxygen—to fuel your brain, which is what makes you feel lightheaded. To prevent that, the body responds by constricting blood vessels and pumping your heart harder and faster. This response is triggered in part (though not exclusively) by signals from the otoliths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray and his colleagues put their volunteers through a fairly rigorous training program that ramped up to two long runs or rides of 60 minutes and two interval sessions each week. The program worked: the runners increased their &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-just-turned-100-heres-what-it-means/"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, a measure of aerobic fitness, by an impressive 25 percent, and the cyclists increased by 20 percent. Average resting heart rate dropped from 61 to 53 beats per minute in the runners, and from 65 to 55 in the cyclists. In the control group, by contrast, none of the fitness parameters changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure the sensitivity of the otoliths, the researchers put their subjects through a procedure called “head-down rotation,” which basically involves lying on your stomach with your head dangling off the end of a table while the scientist moves your head around to shake the otoliths up. Then they used electrodes to measure the nerve signals traveling from the brain to the calf muscles: the idea is that these signals would tell the blood vessels in the calves to constrict if you were about to stand up. Sure enough, the signals decreased dramatically after eight weeks of running, but didn’t change after eight weeks of cycling or not exercising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that data looked like, where “MSNA” (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) is how much nerve signaling there was during the head-down rotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2727014" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Running but not cycling lowers the response of your inner-ear balance organs" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727014" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/graph.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/graph.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Running but not cycling lowers the response of your inner-ear balance organs.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Courtesy ‘Journal of Applied Physiology’)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also estimated blood flow in the calf muscles by measuring how much the calves swelled, and found a similar pattern: triggering the otoliths with head-down rotation caused a reduction in blood flow to the calves by constricting blood vessels, but this response was suppressed after eight weeks of running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the study is that it’s not fitness alone that alters your response to standing suddenly. Instead, there’s something specific to running’s up-and-down motion that seems to make your brain pay less attention to motion signals from your otoliths. This doesn’t mean it’s the only reason for headrushes, but it suggests that it’s one of them. It’s worth noting that the cyclists in this study were on stationary bikes, so it’s possible that real-world cycling might have a little more side-to-side motion that might have a similar effect—though you’d still expect it to be much less than from running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, another situation where runners sometimes feel lightheaded and collapse is at the end of long races. This is also a situation where the heart is having trouble getting enough oxygen to the brain, and it used to be blamed on dehydration. But it generally seems to happen right after people &lt;i&gt;stop&lt;/i&gt; running, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584756/"&gt;which suggests&lt;/a&gt; that it’s actually a problem of blood distribution. When you’re running, your blood vessels are dilated, and the squeezing of your calf muscles with each step pushes blood from your legs back to your heart. When you stop running, your blood vessels are still wide open but this calf-muscle pump suddenly stops, so blood pools in your legs and you feel faint. The takeaway: keep moving after you cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the takeaway from the otolith study, it’s neat to understand what’s happening, and it’s somewhat reassuring to know that it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with my heart or blood-pressure regulation. Is it a problem to have less sensitive otoliths? I’m not sure. I couldn’t find any evidence that runners have worse balance in general than other athletes or the general population. It would be interesting to see data on that. I’m also curious about whether there’s any link between how smooth your running stride is and how sensitive your otoliths are. If so, that might be the nudge I need to finally try to smooth out my notoriously (some would say comically) bouncy running stride. For now, I’ll just take my time getting off the couch.&lt;/p&gt;

This happens because cold weather reduces &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-flow" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood flow"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the joints, making the surrounding muscles tight and less flexible. People with arthritis, existing injuries, or weak muscles may experience even more discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds, “Along with the cold, many tend to move less during winter, which further adds to joint stiffness. Lack of exercise and weight gain can also induce knee pain. These factors increase pressure on the knee joint, so it’s important to pay attention to symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/04/550x309/knee_pain_1759555540752_1759555540994.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Bhalerao highlights signs of knee pain like stiffness, swelling, and discomfort during winter.(Pixabay)" title="Dr Bhalerao highlights signs of knee pain like stiffness, swelling, and discomfort during winter.(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Bhalerao highlights signs of knee pain like stiffness, swelling, and discomfort during winter.(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Bhalerao advises watching out for signs such as stiffness after sitting for long periods, swelling around the knee, clicking sounds, difficulty &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-hospital-orthopaedic-surgeon-with-28-years-of-experience-explains-why-your-knees-hurt-while-climbing-stairs-101761884007930.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="climbing stairs"&gt;climbing stairs&lt;/a&gt;, or discomfort while walking. “If ignored, knee pain may worsen, leading to reduced mobility, aggravated arthritis, or frequent joint strain. It’s essential to take charge of your knees during colder months,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tips to keep your knees healthy this winter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Girish Bhalerao shares the following tips to keep your knees strong, flexible, and pain-free during the colder months:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay warm by wearing knee-friendly thermal supports as recommended by your doctor to keep joints comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do gentle exercises like stretching, brisk walking, or cycling to improve blood circulation and reduce stiffness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen thigh and calf muscles to support the knee and prevent further strain.

However, if the pain becomes unbearable, it’s important to consult a doctor who can advise appropriate treatment. This winter, don’t forget to take care of your knees.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But does walking &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-actually-build-muscle-when-you-work-out-1" target="_blank"&gt;build muscle&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743516303838?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on global participation rates in sport, walking was found to be the most popular physical activity among adults in four of six global regions including the Americas. But are we accomplishing anything more than getting away from our desks for a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to our bodies when we walk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a physiological perspective, walking is a whole body activity,” says Professor &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson"}' href="https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Carson&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist at the University of Limerick and head of science at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://wholesupp.com/collections" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://wholesupp.com/collections"}' href="https://wholesupp.com/collections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Whole Supp&lt;/a&gt;. “When we walk we use our muscles to propel us, which increases our energy expenditure, thus increasing the metabolic demands placed on our muscles and the body as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any exercise, our &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/four-easy-breathwork-routines-for-a-calmer-day" target="_blank"&gt;breathing&lt;/a&gt; speeds up in order to deliver more oxygen to our muscles. But, because walking is relatively steady state—i.e. not too taxing—we’re unlikely to get out of breath unless there’s an added stressor, like going uphill or at a faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a neurological effect. “Our brain and nervous system become more active as we take in and process sensory information from the environment around us and from the movement itself, while at the same time providing stimulatory output to the muscles in a coordinated sequence to help us move fluently,” says Carson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://aaalab.stanford.edu/assets/papers/2014/Give_your_ideas_some_legs.pdf"&gt;2014 Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt; determined that walking provides a significant boost to creative thinking during and after the activity, with an 81% increase in creativity measured in a divergent thinking test compared to when sitting down. Walking outside promoted the highest levels of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while all of this is happening, our body is taking nutrients from our muscle, fat and liver tissues in order to convert them into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else does walking help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re dragging a petulant dog after you, walking is generally considered a good way to unwind. This is because when we walk at a comfortable pace, our parasympathetic nervous system is activated, triggering a reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-cortisol-levels"&gt;cortisol, the stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can also help our brains grow. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21282661/"&gt;A 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 older adults found that regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, increased the size of the hippocampus and raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. “This is like fertilizer for your brain, helping brain cells to grow, strengthen and communicate more effectively with each other,” explains Abigail Ireland, peak performance strategist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.understandingperformance.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.understandingperformance.com/"}' href="https://www.understandingperformance.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Understanding Performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:21:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBJdHRHaGtnZzExdVFfdGJCemdUZzJhNllLOFVZUXV2aGhiaGhYeFh4RlVYUDdZejJIZ3hTVTdBQ0ZLTHB4TVJYMWllNC1CcVN2NGxBdzZ1RmVYT2F1ZzlKTFpxRFFpcWtVejFXVFB5ZnVVUQ</guid></item><item><title>默多克报纸《纽约邮报》警告小RFK的“疯子”十字军东征将导致更多“死孩子” --《每日野兽》</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/murdoch-paper-new-york-post-warns-rfk-jrs-lunatic-crusade-will-lead-to-more-dead-kids/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main-article" class=""&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One of Rupert Murdoch’s most pro-Trump newspapers is warning that Health Secretary Robert F.

    &lt;p&gt;Michael
Avelar, of McKinleyville, passed away on November 29, 2025 at the age
of 42 after living for many years with Machado Joseph’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He
was born on March 15, 1983, in Arcata to Henry and Maria Avelar. His
arrival marked the beginning of a life defined by curiosity,
creativity, and deep connection. Michael grew up surrounded by a
warm, close-knit family who often gathered with relatives and
friends—always with plenty of food, laughter, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a boy, he loved playing Magic cards,
exploring computers, and reading fantasy books late into the
night—long past when he was supposed to be asleep. In his early
teens, he enjoyed playing golf. Michael joined a model rocket club,
building rockets with friends and his close cousin, Jason Lowe, and
delighted in launching them thousands of feet into the sky. His
fascination with the cosmos led to countless nights of telescope
viewing and astrophotography. Michael always wanted to understand how
everything worked and why, a lifelong curiosity that shaped much of
who he became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At
McKinleyville High School, Michael excelled academically. He was
intellectual, scientific, and absorbed knowledge like a sponge. He
thrived on challenging projects—often working extra hours simply
because he loved learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His passion for computers led him to pursue a
career in programming. After attending Humboldt State University,
working in the photo department at Longs Drugs, and living in Arcata,
Michael moved to Seattle, Washington. There, he spent most of his
adult career as a valued computer programmer at Moodlerooms, working
alongside his close childhood friend, Mark Nielsen, before returning
to his hometown of McKinleyville in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael enjoyed camping, fishing with his dad,
mushroom hunting &amp;amp; traveling—visiting Japan and Europe with
Mark, spending a summer in the Azores with family, cruising to the
Bahamas and Alaska, and taking many road trips, including two RV
journeys across the United States &amp;amp; Canada to see national parks
and monuments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In later years, Michael turned inward toward
spirituality. He found joy in spending time with family, taking
scenic drives, and experimenting in the kitchen — making jams, cider,
preserves, and baked treats, all “in the name of science.” Michael’s love of nature remained constant throughout his life. He
also continued to enjoy his evenings playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael
was preceded in death by his mother, Maria, and his brother, Nelson.
He is survived by his father, Henry; his sister, Melissa; his aunt
Elizabeth, her husband Geoff Wright; his cousins Grace, Gavin and
Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The
family extends profound gratitude to all of Michael’s health care
providers, and especially to Jeremy, who lived with Michael as his
primary caregiver and friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
honor of Michael, donations may be made to the National Ataxia
Foundation to help find a cure and ease for others. A celebration of
his life will be held at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ataxia.org"&gt;https://www.ataxia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Michael Avelar’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;loved ones.

She had started to feel a mild anxiety about her sense of direction and purpose in life earlier that year, but within a couple months, that had spiraled into a paranoia that she could neither shake nor explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Referred by her doctor, Dupas began consulting with different psychiatrists, all of whom considered diagnosing her with generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Most wanted to put her on medication right away. But one psychiatrist first ordered bloodwork to see if something else might be going on. “I was mostly depleted of magnesium,” Dupas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most people being treated for mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression typically use a mix of just two strategies: medication (usually an SSRI) and psychotherapy. But there’s increasing interest in the connection between food and the brain, and especially how nutrition could affect psychiatric conditions. Researchers have not only found a connection between the &lt;a href="/2014/11/26/7289495/microbiome-gut-bacteria-health"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and mental health, but also connections between deficiencies in certain micronutrients, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390811003054"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7#Sec28"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;, and conditions like anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s less clear is how supplementation could alleviate certain symptoms. We don’t have robust clinical trial data showing how micronutrients affect people’s mental health, and the role of supplements in mental health is understudied, particularly because the research can be so challenging. Most supplements also don’t require approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to go to market, meaning there’s an abundance of different options, most of which have different formulas that aren’t robustly studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While researchers have long understood that nutrition is important for brain health, people don’t typically look to their diets as a way to improve their mental health, and doctors don’t always think to connect mental health with diet. The link between food and the brain “is overlooked by most people,” says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18123/uma-naidoo"&gt;Uma Naidoo&lt;/a&gt;, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of the 2023 book&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/uma-naidoo-md/calm-your-mind-with-food/9780316502092/"&gt;Calm Your Mind With Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Future research to clarify the link between micronutrients — through either food or supplements — and mental health outcomes could help us stop underestimating that link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-diet-is-linked-to-mental-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diet is linked to mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The connection between diet and the brain seems counterintuitive, but it’s actually linked to basic biology. “The same environment where food is being digested is also the environment where neurotransmitters are produced,” Naidoo says. The gut produces most of the body’s serotonin, as well as a good portion of the neurotransmitter GABA. Drugs used to alter levels of serotonin are frequently used to treat depression and anxiety. The most common group are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the best understood links between nutrition and mental health involves how food affects the gut microbiome. Researchers have known for years now that &lt;a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13712"&gt;gut inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and changes in the gut microbiome are linked to mental conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/abstract/S0166-2236(13)00008-8?kuid=79939ea6-6dfb-43bc-b620-d9ab0df56eaf&amp;amp;kref=https%3A%2F%2Fkemperwellness.com%2Fblog%2Flets-get-real-about-anxiety-and-mental-health%2F"&gt;anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly other &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-023-05003-4"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s also a growing and ongoing interest in how specific vitamins and minerals affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“The brain and mental health are no longer just ‘above the neck’ problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Mass General&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Deficiencies in several different micronutrients, including magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/9/2232"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40263-019-00640-4"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2702216"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7#Sec28"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16930802/"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to affect mental health conditions. Researchers can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390811003054"&gt;induce anxiety in mice&lt;/a&gt;, for example, by manipulating and lowering their magnesium levels. The extent to which supplementation affects mental health in humans is less well-established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The research so far is a little sparse and mixed. A&lt;a href="https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/237565/20240430-16558-smymmw.pdf?"&gt; 2024 review&lt;/a&gt; found that “supplemental magnesium is likely useful in the treatment of mild anxiety and insomnia,” especially in people with already low magnesium. But across studies, results showing how much magnesium supplements can help people with mental health conditions like anxiety or depression are often inconsistent, likely because there are so many different forms these supplements can take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Magnesium, for example, can be taken as a supplement in the forms of magnesium citrate, magnesium malate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, and more. How well the body can make use of magnesium in these different forms, and how good these different forms are at delivering magnesium to the brain still needs to be better studied, says Alexander Rawji, a psychiatrist in Long Island, New York, and the lead author of the paper. Similar challenges exist for other micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As you may have learned in high school biology, eating varied foods rich in certain vitamins and minerals is crucial because your body cannot make its own supply and yet relies on them to perform critical functions. And research suggests that most Americans don’t get nearly enough of many micronutrients. Previous &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview#toc-micronutrient-deficiencies-and-inadequacies-"&gt;national survey data&lt;/a&gt; said that as much as 94 percent of the US population does not get adequate daily vitamin D, 52 percent don’t get enough magnesium, and 92 percent don’t get enough choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Few people would argue that diet is completely unimportant for brain health. But while a connection between nutrition and brain health is clear, the persistent gaps in scientific knowledge make it difficult to really say what role supplements should play in the treatment of mental illness. Ideally, future research would get us to a place where we better understand how micronutrients in the diet distinctly affect the workings of the brain, as well as which supplements are best absorbed by the body and brain. On top of that, we don’t even fully &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-neuroscientist-who-lost-her-mind/201804/we-scientists-know-so-little-about-mental-illness"&gt;understand the mechanisms that cause most mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-role-should-nutrition-play-in-mental-health-care" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role should nutrition play in mental health care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once her blood test results came back, Dupas’ psychiatrist put her on a regimen of supplements — magnesium, L-theanine, B-complex vitamins, and omega-3s — in addition to a small dose of an SSRI. But Dupas didn’t stay on the medication for long. After a couple weeks, “I felt really clear again,” she says. “I could focus again and not feel paranoid that people are coming after me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dupas could be an outlier. Research suggests the vast majority of people with a mental health condition won’t see dramatic improvement of their symptoms from supplementation alone. Nevertheless, she’s grateful that she stumbled across a doctor who actually ordered bloodwork to see if there may be any hidden culprits exacerbating symptoms and hopes more patients get similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Providers should be ordering bloodwork for patients, especially if they have multiple health conditions and medications that could be affecting their health, Rawji says. And if they have a deficiency, that’s certainly something to address. A complicating factor, however, is the fact that blood panels can’t always give you a perfect picture of what’s going on — tests to detect magnesium levels in blood serum often come back normal even if their body stores of magnesium are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Regardless, Rawji uses supplements as “part of a multipronged approach” in his treatment of patients, he says. How much the supplements will help will vary person to person, and they definitely shouldn’t replace other treatments, including medications like SSRIs or benzodiazepines. “If you expect magnesium to be a benzo for anxiety then you’re going to be very disappointed,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not all psychiatrists are trained to ask questions related to diet when assessing patients or to look for nutrition deficiencies, according to Naidoo, the doctor from Mass General. This could lead to ignoring relatively easy interventions that can make real differences. Furthermore, overemphasizing supplements comes with its own risks. If you eat a healthy, well-balanced whole foods diet, you’ll probably get more than enough of the vitamins and minerals you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s “almost always” an opportunity to use nutrition to improve mental health, since no one really has a perfect diet, says Naidoo. If you’re particularly concerned with including more of certain micronutrients into your diet, she suggests eating more green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes for magnesium.

'Heroin is ruining my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This man was my first patient when I became a psychologist 15 years ago, specialising in the field of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'll never forget him because, as he spoke to me about the power his addiction held over his life, I realised with a jolt that his story reflected my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My addiction wasn't to drugs, however. I was addicted to dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as he spoke, I realised that this man – and, after him, countless other patients who shared honest details of their powerlessness with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-617b57f0-d9a5-11f0-96fa-73a1cf6149d9"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, gambling and many other habits – reflected my own relationship with food back to me far better than any therapist or doctor ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All those patients described feeling short–changed by substance abuse, just as I felt utterly short-changed by my then-decades of dieting, which had only left me miserable, at war with my own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From my teenage years, I had tried every diet going – to no avail. At my heaviest, at 5ft 7in aged 21, I was almost 19st – both the fattest person and the most compulsive dieter around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was because, just as every high had left my patients more addicted to their vice, each of my own failed diets had only given me a stronger addiction to every aspect of the weight-loss cycle: the 'highs' for me were the sense of control that restrictive eating brought – and the release of the binge that would inevitably follow the diet's failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shahroo Izadi in her 20s – after a failed gastric–band operation and years of diets followed by heavy bingeing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I had been trained to support society's most change-resistant and highly addicted people. It was a revelation to realise my own behaviour was driven by similar emotional and biological – behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For alongside the psychological pendulum of the highs ('I'll be so happy when I lose the weight') and lows (the inevitable breaking point of a diet), the cycle of dieting and bingeing triggers a flood of chemicals in your brain that over time become entrenched – making each subsequent attempt at control more likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the diet industry actually wants you to fail – it needs you to feel broken, powerless and dependent on its solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because if you believed you could trust yourself around food, you'd stop buying diet products, joining weight–loss programmes and listening to the endless conflicting advice that keeps the industry profitable. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six years of working with NHS patients, I moved into private practice – helping people who suffered from substance misuse and running workshops for health workers on how to empower addicts to change for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But given my personal experience, one addiction fascinated me more than any other: dieting. It seemed everywhere I looked, I could see people like myself, quietly imprisoned in its cycle and who simply couldn't conceive of a life without being on a diet – despite how ineffective their eating plans proved in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I've heard tearful confessions of global leaders of industry who manage complex careers, but can't control themselves around a doughnut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reality is that smart, disciplined people can also be diet addicts, trapped in cycles of restrictive eating and wild food binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, this was my life until my late 20s. I remember first feeling dissatisfied with my shape aged ten, when other children would make fun of my size, and my family – concerned about my weight – encouraged me to eat less and avoid 'naughty' foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a teenager, I began taking appetite suppressants (bought online via pro–anorexia forums) and embraced absurdly restrictive diets: boiled eggs and cabbage soup; only celery; or just meat. I lost weight, but it was obviously unsustainable and I'd end up bingeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those binges taught me eating large quantities of fatty, sugary foods was exhilarating, euphoric – even emotionally numbing. I'd restrict for days, then see a photo and feel hopeless. That combined with hunger made me cancel plans and spend entire weekends eating to physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After every binge, though, came shame... and I would start a new diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was very similar to the trajectory of substance abuse. The more I dieted, the less effective those diets became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In turn, I started needing a higher 'dose' of my drug, if you will, just as a drug addict might – in my case, this took the form of making my diets even more restrictive to shift any weight at all, almost starving myself between binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As my diets became more intense, my binges became more extreme, too – so much so the skin on my stomach and thighs would itch (I looked up what this was, and discovered it was actually the formation of stretch marks – the skin stretching and tearing in real time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, in my second year of university, aged 21, I had gastric–band surgery paid for privately. Ashamed, I kept it secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially, I was able to eat as much as I had always done after the surgery – because the band had been installed around my upper stomach and was loose enough that I wouldn't feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once I'd recovered from the operation, I could return to get it tightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, in that pre-tightening stage, I ate almost nothing. Then, predictably, I ate everything 'one last time'. After all, I no longer needed to rely on myself to get thin – I had the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it was tightened, I lost weight quickly – so I kept asking the surgeon to tighten it as much as possible, essentially using it to starve myself. I went from a size 22/24 to a size 6 at my smallest, in about a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first time, I was very slim, around 52kg (8st 2lb). But old habits die hard. I was in and out of the clinic for 18 months, asking for extreme loosening or tightening, and playing out my restriction-rebellion pattern of crash dieting – only this time with a surgical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the band, I found ways to continue bingeing – soft, high-calorie foods I could get down, even when my stomach felt very tight. Eventually, the pain became unbearable and I was operated on again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon explained he'd had to remove the band because it had slipped from its original position (a recognised complication, which can be linked to overeating).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was 26 and had been struggling with the band for years – by then I weighed around 90kg (around 14st 2lb) again. I cried, knowing I'd hit rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I then went to therapy, a habit I would keep for the next decade. Eventually, it helped me think about my problem objectively and have compassion for myself, the way I would for anyone else. Like I would for any addict, as I now see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Izadi today... she says she is living proof that anyone can conquer addiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Encouraged by my therapist, I resolved to act as if I'd never lose weight. Before that point, I wouldn't wear make-up when overweight, do my hair or even light a candle at home – nice things were for thin people, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now I was to treat my body kindly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, I noticed I felt more deserving, and found myself losing weight and not gaining it back – simply because I wasn't eating uncontrollably. Then I had my eureka moment with my heroin-addicted patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I had already been trained in managing addictions by teaching patients simple techniques that help build their confidence to confront their addiction and break their habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I began to use these techniques myself – for example, one of the most powerful was to repeatedly say to myself as I fell into another binge: 'These hands are my hands'. It reinforced that I wasn't powerless. This technique is about preventing that experience from reinforcing the powerlessness that fuels addiction. In my case, it helped break the cycle of frantic over-consumption and restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By treating my struggle with the compassion I would give an addict struggling to stick to their programme, I lost 8st in 18 months. I had finally learned to manage my addiction to dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once I realised the overlap between my dysfunctional behaviour and other addictions I was treating as a medical professional, I began to research the exact biological and psychological mechanisms by which dieting addiction works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I've mentioned, diets create a psychological pendulum, where the 'high' of perfect restriction swings inevitably to the 'low' release of complete abandon – setting up a psychological dynamic where the eventual breakdown feels like both failure and release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the restriction phase increases stress hormones such as cortisol (because restricting food is stressful!), while simultaneously creating the psychological anticipation of future reward (joy on losing weight). It's a psychologically intoxicating, dangerous mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the inevitable breaking point of a diet triggers a flood of relief chemicals in your brain – dopamine, serotonin, endorphins – as you finally eat forbidden foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This relief is immediately followed by intense shame, creating another cortisol spike that drives the need for more relief. You return to restriction as the only way to escape the shame of failure, beginning the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The more times you cycle through diets, the deeper these psychological pathways become entrenched. Your attachment to dieting isn't logical – it's biochemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, research published in Obesity Reviews in 2015 shows just how repeated dieting only succeeds in heightening your body's response. Scientists found each cycle of weight loss and regain progressively amplifies both metabolic changes and psychological drive that lead you to overeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When I treated dieting like addiction recovery – gradually changing my habits, one step at a time, so eventually I was eating regularly, which prevented my body unleashing those biological responses which had fuelled my diet addiction, and so changed my entire mindset – the brain chemistry normalised. This took more than 18 months, and I lost 8st (I've maintained stable weight since 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But aside from this mental impact, what else makes diets doomed to fail – yet simultaneously addictive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also disrupt your body's hormone levels and other regulatory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you restrict food severely, even for short periods, your body can enter a state of perceived famine. It doesn't understand concepts like 'diet' or 'bikini body'. It simply registers a dangerous shortage of incoming energy and triggers a cascade of biological changes to protect you from potential starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because your body has a setpoint weight – a particular pre-determined weight range. Everyone's is naturally different – but the further below it you go, the more aggressively your body fights to preserve it, and the sooner your diet will fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, when you diet, your body reduces production of hormones that signal fullness – such as leptin, GLP–1 (the hormone used in weight-loss jabs such as Wegovy) and peptide YY – which in turn increases your appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Significantly, a 2011 study by the University of Melbourne tracked 50 dieters across 12 months and showed these hormonal adaptations persist long after weight loss, creating sustained biological pressure towards weight regain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In short, dieting makes you hungrier, even after you have finished dieting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also decrease your metabolism (the rate you burn calories) as your body slows down energy expenditure because it perceives a potential famine ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This perceived famine also affects the dieter's brain, causing an urgent 'eat now while you can' mindset as soon as food becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not gluttony or lack of discipline – rather a deep-rooted survival instinct, as your brain responds with appropriate urgency. Hence the frantic nature of binges that occur after diets: eating while standing up; barely chewing; and sometimes not even tasting the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets also change how your brain responds to food, making your reward centres more sensitive to it. Research by Columbia University in 2008 used MRI scans and found that, after weight loss, brain regions associated with reward lit up more intensely when shown food images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that what would give a normal eater a mild pleasure response instead hits with the force of an overwhelming compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That first bite triggers dopamine release – a feelgood chemical in the brain involved in reward and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years of restriction-binge cycles make a dieter's brain hypersensitive to this response. That's why that first bite triggers such a powerful drive to keep eating. I've watched this in hundreds of clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps the most fascinating thing is what happens to a dieter's executive function, the part of the brain involved in rational decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets force one's executive function to be temporarily overridden by the urgent need to survive the perceived famine. Yale University research in 2011 showed food restriction reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex – home of the brain's executive function – while increasing activity in regions associated with reward-seeking. No amount of willpower can overcome this urge to eat. It's like trying to think your way out of a sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long periods of food restriction also wear down mental energy, a well-documented phenomenon known as cognitive depletion, which affects everyone under conditions of prolonged self-discipline, making impulse control much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Put simply then, diets are toxic for your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the ultimate goal of any abusive relationship is to create 'learned helplessness', a psychological state where victims stop believing escape is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like an abusive partner, diets create this state of mind through repeated experiences of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The diet industry is set up to profit from the lucrative cycle of failing, says Ms Izadi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even when you've experienced a diet's failure first-hand dozens of times, this state of learned helplessness keeps you trapped in the cycle. I've seen people for whom dieting has become so fused with their identity that they don't know who they would be without it. For these people, stopping dieting prompts a form of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So why isn't dieting commonly viewed as an addiction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I believe it remains largely undiagnosed because it falls through the cracks of existing clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are large overlaps with eating disorders, most obviously with binge-eating disorder (BED), where sufferers have recurring episodes of eating large quantities of food rapidly to the point of discomfort, accompanied by feelings of guilt or distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet addicts can be mislabelled as suffering from BED – but this is different from BED, because it has a large component of compulsive restriction to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's also obvious overlap between dieting addiction and anorexia – and also with bulimia's binge-eating episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At heart, I believe this psychological problem is caused by the modern diet industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After all, it is the diet industry – whether via meal-replacement shakes, calorie-counting plans or unbalanced protein-heavy diets such as Atkins and keto – which encourages us to attempt weight loss using quick-fix approaches that trigger biological starvation responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the vast majority of dieters regain weight. But this failure – and state of learned helplessness it inflicts – only means you'll chase another diet again, buying books, products and downloading apps, boosting the industry's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It profits from your shame of failing, in what is a perniciously lucrative cycle for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But you can conquer your addiction to its product – and rediscover your natural instincts around food. I'm living proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Why fat jabs aren't the answer...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My clinical work has shown me recovery from dieting and disordered eating requires you to develop an unshakeable self-trust around food. To know you can control yourself, on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why so many popular weight–loss tactics don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Take fat jabs – they portray food as the enemy and your powers of self-control as requiring external assistance. The same goes for fat camps, gastric bands and appetite suppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pre-prepared meals that arrive at your door are also another crutch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only route forwards is to painstakingly reform the habits that cause your overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Adapted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; How Diets Make Us Fat by Shahroo Izadi (Leap, £20). © Shahroo Izadi 2025.

    &lt;p&gt;Her message was echoed by Nick Thayer, the head of policy for the Company Chemists Association. He said there is “no national shortage of flu vaccines, but the bulk of them are administered in October and November”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that “by the time you get to December, some places are running low, and some will have none left from their original allocation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may therefore need to shop around for your flu vaccine. “Look on the websites for pharmacies, look on the NHS website, if you are eligible for a free jab or talk to your local pharmacy and ask,” Thayer advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to get the vaccine before Christmas, stick to the basics to reduce your risk of catching the flu. These include handwashing, avoiding crowded indoor gatherings, staying home when unwell, and self-isolating within families where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu jab remains a valuable layer of protection, according to Dr Clarke. It is safe and generally thought to achieve maximum protection for an individual after 10 to 14 days. Whilst there is still a chance you might get the flu after having the jab, it is likely to be milder and not last as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection from the flu vaccine goes down over the year and the types of virus it protects against are updated annually, which is why it is important to stay up to date with your inoculations, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst this year’s dominant strain is thought to be a mutated version of the influenza A virus, data shows that the flu vaccine still provides good protection against it. The UK Health Security Agency found it has been &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;70 to 75 per cent effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17, and 30 to 40 per cent effective in adults&lt;/a&gt;. This is broadly in line with effectiveness in previous flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 17 million vaccines have been delivered this autumn, which is 350,000 more compared to this time last year, although Dr Clarke wishes more of us would choose to be inoculated. The latest National Flu and Covid-19 Surveillance Report shows that only 70.9 per cent of over-65s have received their flu jab this season. Rates amongst eligible under-65s are far lower, hovering around 35 per cent. “It really would make a difference,” says Dr Clarke.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A plague that swept through Eurasia for 2,000 years – millennia before the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-dna-evidence-reveals-where-the-black-death-most-likely-originated"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of the Middle Ages – has only ever been detected in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-the-earliest-evidence-of-plague-in-a-neolithic-graveyard"&gt;human remains&lt;/a&gt;, until now. For decades, it has been unclear how the Bronze Age plague spread so widely, but now we know which animal was a likely carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of archaeologists sifted through scraps of DNA in the bones and teeth of Bronze Age cattle, goats, and sheep, as part of a large, ongoing study to track how these animals migrated, alongside humans, from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-dust-may-have-determined-the-spread-of-ancient-human-civilisations"&gt;Fertile Crescent&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle East across Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such ancient samples of animal DNA are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0569"&gt;never fully intact&lt;/a&gt;, usually quite fragmented, and very contaminated with the leftovers of organisms that inhabited the animal's body in life, and long after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/black-deaths-carnage-traced-to-a-volcanic-eruption-half-a-world-away"&gt;Black Death's Carnage Traced to a Volcanic Eruption Half a World Away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we test livestock DNA in ancient samples, we get a complex genetic soup of contamination," University of Arkansas archaeologist Taylor Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a large barrier to getting a strong signal for the animal, but it also gives us an opportunity to look for pathogens that infected herds and their handlers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pathogen Hermes and his colleagues encountered in the remains of a 4,000-year-old domesticated sheep unearthed at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkaim"&gt;Arkaim&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeological site &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkaim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in the Southern Ural Mountains of Russia, stopped them in their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one tooth was the DNA of the plague bacteria, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; an ancient strain that was unable to infect fleas, as it did later during the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/em&gt;had yet to figure out how to use fleas as a vector during the Bronze Age, archaeologists have often wondered how the plague spread so widely among humans. We know many humans died from infection, their bodies still containing genetic traces of an identical strain of plague, uncovered at sites thousands of kilometers apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of the Late Neolithic Bronze Age lineage of the bacteria found in a non-human animal, a discovery which the researchers shared &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancestor-of-black-death-has-been-discovered-in-bronze-age-sheep"&gt;in a preprint&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. The research has now been peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185507" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185507" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MapOfBronzeAgePlagueFoundInHumansAndSheep-642x268.jpg" alt="Map of Eurasia showing sites where human remains containing plague bacteria DNA have been found, and one sheep.

(Light-Maka et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to imagine how domestic sheep, roaming across the vast grasslands of the Eurasian Steppe, may have encountered a wild animal carrying the bacteria, but not made sick by it, and then spread it between herds and shepherds. However, the team notes they can't rule out human-to-sheep transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It had to be more than people moving. Our plague sheep gave us a breakthrough," Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now see it as a dynamic between people, livestock and some still unidentified 'natural reservoir' for it, which could be rodents on the grasslands of the Eurasian steppe or migratory birds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185219" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-642x639.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-185219" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-642x639.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-678x675.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-768x764.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission-600x597.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/conceptual-scenario-for-LNBA-lineage-transmission.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185219" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Conceptual scenario of the LNBA lineage transmission concluded from sheep- and human-derived &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; genomes. (Light-Maka et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking down the DNA of ancient pathogens is tricky. People don't bury animals with the same care as they do other humans, so their remains are not usually so well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many specimens of domestic animals that archaeologists find are actually the leftovers of human meals, which means they tend to have been cooked (a sure-fire way to break down the DNA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-black-death-shaped-human-evolution-and-were-still-in-its-shadow"&gt;The Black Death Shaped Human Evolution, And We're Still in Its Shadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, people tend to avoid consuming visibly sick animals, and therefore faunal assemblages are likely biased toward healthy animals," biologist Ian Light-Maka, of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Hermes, and their colleagues write in their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when infected animals are consumed, a single animal may infect many people, and the probability of that specific animal being found and later studied may be low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only the third time that some strain of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; has ever been found in ancient animals. The first two were a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0569"&gt;medieval rat&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06676-7"&gt;Neolithic dog&lt;/a&gt;; however, those DNA samples were too fragmented to produce reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest find is particularly exciting, Hermes &lt;a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/80485/how-did-bronze-age-plague-spread-a-sheep-might-solve-the-mystery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, because the site where this sheep was found, Arkaim, is a human settlement linked to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintashta_culture"&gt;Sintashta culture&lt;/a&gt;, known for creating impressive bronze weapons, riding horses, and spreading their genes into Central Asia. These people have also been found with traces of the Late Neolithic Bronze Age (LNBA) plague strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this infected sheep lived, the Sintashta were just beginning to expand their livestock herds, since their horse-riding abilities allowed them to cover greater territory quickly, potentially increasing exposure to wild species harboring the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, it is not possible with a single genome to reconstruct a complete understanding of the ecology of the LNBA lineage across the diverse set of cultures and geographies afflicted by this prehistoric plague lineage, and our results suggest its reservoir remains at large," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;conclude.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.029"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Apneic means you stop breathing, and that’s obviously supremely dangerous,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeated coughing can also cause patients to pull muscles and break ribs, Newman added. “Sometimes, especially small infants, they need to be intubated so we can control their lungs... it can be very scary, especially for our little ones,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“This huge surge that you’re seeing right now is almost completely related to decreased vaccination rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Dr. Melanie Wellington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropping vaccination rates are the reason behind this year’s surge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of both political and social media influences, we’re seeing vaccination rates drop across the board for all diseases,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are down among kindergartners" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6938778de4b0447a52b8bb0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;are down among kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; throughout the country. This includes the vaccine for whooping cough, which is known as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Overall DTaP vaccination rates dropped from 92.3% to 92.1% from 2024 to 2025, with states such as Idaho reporting a 78.3% vaccination rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diseases that didn’t achieve a necessary level of elimination (such as whooping cough and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/south-carolina-confirms-measles-outbreak-with-us-cases-at-25-year-high_n_68e152b6e4b01314b83e05ae" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="measles" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6938778de4b0447a52b8bb0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68e152b6e4b01314b83e05ae" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;) have been lingering beneath the service and causing outbreaks, Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As vaccination rates fall, disease rates rise,” Wellington explained. “And so this huge surge that you’re seeing right now is almost completely related to decreased vaccination rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lower vaccination rates, the formulation of the vaccine also changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current pertussis vaccines that we use now have fewer side effects than the ones we used in the ’90s and before, but the immunity from them doesn’t last as long as the older vaccines did,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated people can, in rare cases, carry whooping cough and have no symptoms or have mild symptoms, Newman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Critics will say, ‘Well, if you can still get malformed disease and still pass it on, then why vaccinate?’ But the more people you vaccinate ... even if one person ends up getting a mild form of the disease or carrying it, if the next person is vaccinated, they’re less likely to be a carrier, and so on and so forth,” Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bolsters protection in the community, which then protects the most vulnerable, such as infants and immunocompromised people, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Whooping cough rates are increasing throughout the United States.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself, your family and your community, and you need to get it multiple times throughout your life to stay protected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since immunity wanes from the vaccine, it’s not a one-and-done kind of shot; it requires a booster during multiple points of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s recommended that all adults who are 18 and over get a Tdap [shot] ... if you haven’t had one as an adult,” said Wellington. “And then get a booster probably every 10 years.” (DTaP is the vaccination for infants and young children, and Tdap is the vaccination for older children and adults.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended that pregnant people get a Tdap booster during every pregnancy, said Li. “That Tdap booster is the most important thing you can do to protect babies who are at highest risk of dying from pertussis — because the babies who are at highest risk are too young to be vaccinated themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a pregnant person gets vaccinated, they then pass the antibodies on to the baby, according to Li. It’s also recommended that those who are going to be around an infant, say a grandchild, niece or godchild, get a Tdap booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies get their first shot that protects against pertussis at 2 months old, but they don’t get great protection until their second or third dose, so not until they’re 6 months or 1 year old, said Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are additional steps you can take for protection, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With whooping cough being so prevalent right now, it’s important for vaccinated people to understand they can still get mild forms of the disease. If you notice a cough or any upper respiratory illness symptoms, stay home, Wellington stressed. That’s true whether you have a cold or something more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you absolutely can’t stay home, because we all have times when there’s no options, [or] if you have to go out into public when you’re sick, wear a mask,” Wellington added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any symptoms of whooping cough (or any illness), also stay away from infants. If you suspect you have whooping cough, or your child does, talk to your doctor or pediatrician immediately. Monitoring may be necessary for infants, and there are also treatments available, Wellington noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been around someone with whooping cough, you should also let your doctor know. “We also give antibiotics to somebody who’s been exposed to pertussis and doesn’t have it yet,” Wellington explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to avoid whooping cough, if possible, which is best done through vaccination, according to Newman. The more people who are vaccinated means the less spread of the bacteria, which means healthier people and safer communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMDFUYnkyc3NMRGU1eTgxVU80ZVJzeHVhdWZDM2RMWE82UGJfa1dsYVJfOE5yLV9IT2hUelZQSHBEWUxsblFidEJaRVpULWFyTHFqYWtPSDlnM2xiOV9vT2tHNVRtWUJLa2J3cUFwSmpGZVFhTWtiNFp1YXFzeUpjcFBoLVN4TG5XQzUtYUlmc2xyNktiSlFXemQ3NV9XXzZhdnfSAacBQVVfeXFMTkxSZC01WEJPOGduWDhoLWthZjk5TUVCc3RDdjQ1eGd0N2dDMkVNLTJKOTVDT3RzeXpMTTZYdjUzejhPLXZDR01nVkFPc2d6V2VuUThJYmhneDJENUV4Z0I0bnFiUkpydXV2QUVFTzUyVFV6X0k0T2V1ck1ON204ZGpaMzVObmdDcEdLZ1FFcV9MczFZMjIyLWhtZUhRSzUyd1lLMHJUVVU</guid></item><item><title>成千上万的美国农民患有帕金森氏症。他们归咎于致命的杀虫剂。- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/thousands-of-us-farmers-have-parkinsons-they-blame-a-deadly-pesticide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content impact-article  "&gt;&lt;p class="customEmbed_01"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z2M3ANX3OVHE7AJEJ2RHC4MRFM"&gt;Paul Friday remembers when his hand started flopping in the cold weather – the first sign nerve cells in his brain were dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W2ZE2LIMJFE3ZJCXFF2QQIPBB4"&gt;He was eventually diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a brain disease that gets worse over time.

SinoChem posted &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/sinochem-holdings/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;$3.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. &lt;a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Financial%20Report%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Syngenta reported&lt;/a&gt; $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-99" data-gaid="inarticle-99"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HHGMRJMUP5GU3JY3G6FGHXB7DQ"&gt;While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-100" data-gaid="inarticle-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RSBBWQ5DLJDOXLNWJQ2SRW3PVE"&gt;“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-101" data-gaid="inarticle-101"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="764KX4XJJ5GRDMKSZTE6QVPBVU"&gt;Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/paraquat" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to the Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-102" data-gaid="inarticle-102"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2Q3265P3B5G75MRS6LQ7VPOELU"&gt;“EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-103" data-gaid="inarticle-103"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="43QS4VGRE5EHPODA5PWMI53J2Y"&gt;The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-104" data-gaid="inarticle-104"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HJPUMSSU5NBHPDMFC4D5BIEY5M"&gt;“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-105" data-gaid="inarticle-105"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="34QDSAGPFFGZLJAGBAEU6DG5JA"&gt;This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-106" data-gaid="inarticle-106"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VGLT7MCGHFD2ZEWWSWWRBROO6A"&gt;For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-107" data-gaid="inarticle-107"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="quote-container"&gt;&lt;div class="impact-quote pullquote"&gt;&lt;div class="quote-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="source-attribution"&gt;Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz from EarthJustice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-108" data-gaid="inarticle-108"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2JUORFJJCJGV3FHSBIL4RL2PPM"&gt;More than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years.

Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-119" data-gaid="inarticle-119"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NE5I2W6LO5BYNNLYCBLZBHK2LY"&gt;The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0855-0554" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;agency in October&lt;/a&gt; updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-120" data-gaid="inarticle-120"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5AT4THVERJGOLMIZJSEAS63CNQ"&gt;Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again.

Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pesticides/EPA-allow-new-dicamba-herbicides/103/web/2025/07" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a different, controversial weed killer&lt;/a&gt; that had previously been banned by federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-122" data-gaid="inarticle-122"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Growing pressure to ban it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-123" data-gaid="inarticle-123"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KIE4VEVGPFAYFEAXHJ7PT74PPM"&gt;But grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-124" data-gaid="inarticle-124"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YRPVDBB45FHV3JDLWBID2RHIGY"&gt;“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-125" data-gaid="inarticle-125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YZHJ4EKKUJAJ5LD6DMQD3O7FIY"&gt;Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-126" data-gaid="inarticle-126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NIAR7O7LD5AUBDL3NLGQWZCG2Y"&gt;“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said &lt;a href="https://casar.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/casar.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/casar-paraquat-epa-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;an Oct. 7, 2024&lt;/a&gt;, letter signed by U.S. representatives.

Many people turn to them in an effort to fast-track heart health benefits, but they may not provide the desired outcome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We asked our chief medical officer, Sohaib Imtiaz, MD, if taking omega-3 supplements is the best approach to improving cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;em&gt;*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Q: Omega-3s have a reputation for being heart-healthy, but it seems that their benefits are more nuanced. Does taking omega-3 supplements actually benefit your heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Imtiaz: &lt;/strong&gt;The results of taking omega-3s for heart health are inconsistent. Researchers haven't confirmed that they offer significant cardiovascular protection.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The overall data show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-omega-3-11772277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;omega-3 supplements&lt;/a&gt; modestly reduce coronary heart disease events and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-high-triglycerides-697535" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; (a measure of fats in the blood). But the evidence doesn't show a decrease in overall mortality, cardiovascular events, stroke, or arrhythmia.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, high doses of omega-3 (more than 1 gram per day) are linked to increased risk of developing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/atrial-fibrillation-7372562" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; (Afib), a rapid, irregular heartbeat.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-about-omega-3s-from-food"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What About Omega-3s From Food? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3s from food are actually better for your heart than taking supplements. Fish, a primary source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-often-to-eat-fish-omega3-11839568" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;omega-3 in your diet&lt;/a&gt;, is good for your cardiovascular health. However, supplementing with omega-3 hasn't shown any significant benefits.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We don't exactly know why this is, but it could be related to the cofactors (chemical compounds that help enzymes work effectively) in your food that affect how the omega-3s act. A supplement is just a dose of that particular thing, without any helpful enzymes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is an interesting explanation, but we don't have enough evidence to say for sure that this is why omega-3 supplements are less effective than those from food.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-heart-healthy-supplements-to-take-instead"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Heart-Healthy Supplements to Take Instead &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart health can be very complicated because there are so many factors that can cause you to have cardiovascular disease. You should talk to a healthcare provider before trying any supplements for heart health, because not all of them will be beneficial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It really depends on your health. For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-magnesium-should-i-take-8662648" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium supplements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may be beneficial if you have low magnesium levels, as they are often associated with high cholesterol and high blood pressure.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-folic-acid-8665129" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folic acid supplements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may contribute to heart health in people with high homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a B vitamin that can damage the arteries if levels are too high.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-garlic-lower-blood-pressure-11771714" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garlic supplements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may benefit individuals with high blood pressure or a lipid disorder, such as high triglycerides or cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Again, these are just examples, and you should never replace your medication with supplements. Always talk to a healthcare provider to decide if adding a supplement to your medication regimen is right for you.

In severe cases, blood vessels begin to leak. And in the worst cases, that can lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More than 14 million people contracted dengue &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the real number is likely several times higher. While it remains most common in South Asia and Latin America, it’s no longer just a tropical disease. Warming temperatures are pushing dengue into southern Europe and the United States. Last year, Texas saw its &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-public-health-officials-announce-first-locally-acquired-case-dengue-virus-2024"&gt;highest case count in two decades&lt;/a&gt;, including locally acquired infections, meaning the virus is now circulating here, not just arriving with travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Dengue has no treatment. Doctors can manage the pain and keep you hydrated, but there’s nothing that actually fights the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;But, a new pill called mosnodenvir just proved it can stop the virus, the first time any drug has been shown to have effectiveness against dengue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;However, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, the company behind mosnodenvir, already walked away from developing it, joining a long line of drug makers chasing better money in cancer and obesity drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The disease is now spreading to new parts of the world. The drug is stuck in limbo, and the gap between what we need and what the market will fund keeps growing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The public health tools we have — the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/5/18/23724011/dengue-fever-mosquitos-virus-vaccines"&gt;dengue vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, bed nets, fogging campaigns, public awareness to drain standing water — are all aimed at keeping mosquitos at bay and preventing infections in the first place. There’s nothing for after: no antivirals — nothing like Paxlovid for Covid, or Tamiflu for the flu, or artemisinin for malaria. Once you’re sick, the strategy is just supportive care and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Earlier this month, though, that changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A new antiviral pill for dengue called mosnodenvir showed promising results in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2500179"&gt;early phase 2 trials&lt;/a&gt;. In a study where volunteers were deliberately exposed to dengue, roughly half of those who received the highest dose never got sick at all. For a field that has struggled for decades to find an effective antiviral, it’s the clearest evidence yet that a drug can prevent dengue — and researchers believe the same pill could eventually treat people who are already infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, even before the results were published, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, the American pharmaceutical giant that developed mosnodenvir, had already abandoned any efforts to bring the drug to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year J&amp;amp;J announced it would wind down its dengue antiviral work, with a “strategic reprioritization” of its research toward non-communicable diseases like cancer and obesity. What this means is that one of the most promising dengue drugs ever tested is now without a pharma sponsor, waiting for someone else to carry it forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;André Siqueira, who heads the dengue program at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), said mosnodenvir is “very, very promising” and said he wants to see it pushed into further trials “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But why — if the drug shows much promise — would its maker walk away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s exit isn’t an outlier; it’s part of a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/major-pharmaceutical-companies-dropping-antibiotic-projects-superbugs-2018-7"&gt;broader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3"&gt;retreat&lt;/a&gt; from infectious disease research across the pharmaceutical industry, as companies shift toward drugs for wealthier markets: cancer, obesity, autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dengue already &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518"&gt;kills thousands every&lt;/a&gt; year, and it’s getting worse. By 2080, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/climate/dengue-mosquito-spread-map.html"&gt;climate models suggest&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 60 percent of the world’s population could be living in areas where dengue spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, in this new world, watching the first antiviral pill that works against dengue get abandoned — while the disease spreads to new continents — reveals the gap between the drugs we need and the drugs the market will deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A worker fumigates an alleyway in a densely populated neighborhood to kill mosquitoes in the capital city of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

It’s a faster way to get answers than waiting for people to get sick naturally, but it requires volunteers willing to sign up for a controlled case of dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Among people who got the highest dose of mosnodenvir, 6 out of 10 never developed an infection at all. The other four had much lower levels of virus in their blood and milder symptoms than the placebo group, where everyone got sick. At lower doses, the drug delayed infection but didn’t prevent it — a clear signal that the higher dose was doing something real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s one of the most beautiful dose-response results I’ve seen,” Anna Durbin, the Johns Hopkins researcher who led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/antiviral-drug-abandoned-pharma-shows-promise-against-dengue"&gt;told Science last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then, there’s the field data. In 2023, J&amp;amp;J launched a trial across more than 30 sites in South America and Asia to test whether the drug could protect people in the same household who are at high risk of getting bitten by the same mosquitoes. Among 265 people who received the highest dose, not a single person developed symptomatic dengue. In the placebo group, 60 percent did. (This data hasn’t been formally peer-reviewed yet, but it’s &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05201794"&gt;posted publicly&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;The Aedes genus of mosquitos carries diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Culture Club/Bridgeman via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For Neelika Malavige, a prominent dengue researcher at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Sri Lanka, the significance goes beyond the numbers. “It’s a huge scientific breakthrough just doing the study,” she said, referring to the design of the challenge trial itself, which had never been done for a dengue antiviral before. For a disease with no approved treatment, this is as close to proof of concept as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The dengue community may be closer than ever to a long-awaited treatment,” Xuping Xie of the University of Texas Medical Branch wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2515056"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="but-there-are-some-caveats" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;But, there are some caveats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The trial proved that mosnodenvir can prevent infection, a first for any dengue drug. But prevention isn’t what dengue doctors need most. What they need is a treatment, something to give patients who are already sick to keep them from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s what makes an antiviral so valuable. Prevention strategies have a ceiling; you can reduce mosquito populations, but you can’t eliminate them, and warming temperatures keep pushing them into new territory. A drug that works &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; exposure would be the first tool that doesn’t depend on stopping the mosquito first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The hope is that the same drug could do both. Mosnodenvir works by blocking the virus from replicating, and, in theory, that should help whether you take it before you’re infected or shortly after. The question is timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s where dengue gets tricky. Unlike malaria, where the parasite lingers, and you can kill it with drugs, the dengue virus moves through the body notoriously fast. By the time a patient feels sick enough to see a doctor — usually a few days into the fever — the virus is often already on its way out. The brutal symptoms that follow, the blood vessel leakage and organ damage, are driven largely by the body’s own immune response, not the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a global health reporter, this story felt grimly familiar. The things we pay attention to get solved, and so-called neglected tropical diseases have become something that just happens elsewhere. It’s the reason why tuberculosis is still the deadliest infectious disease and why it took 35 years to develop the first malaria vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This line from a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/magazine/what-the-world-needs-now-is-ddt.html"&gt;2004 article&lt;/a&gt; captures this quite well: “Probably the worst thing that ever happened to malaria in poor nations was its eradication in rich ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;I grew up in Mumbai, where dengue was a regular occurrence every monsoon season. But the disease isn’t staying there anymore. It’s spreading — into southern Europe, into the United States — and the question of who develops drugs for it is no longer someone else’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is why antivirals have been so hard to develop for dengue. The window to intervene can be narrow, and for many patients, it’s already closing by the time they show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scientists who developed mosnodenvir believe it could work as a treatment. “If you reduce the amount of replicating virus, you will also reduce the likelihood that the patient evolves towards severe disease,” said Johan Neyts, a virologist at KU Leuven whose lab co-discovered the drug. The logic is in line with how antivirals for, say Covid, work, but this hypothesis hasn’t been tested in humans. Treatment trials were planned in Singapore, but the Covid pandemic made them impossible. By the time restrictions lifted, J&amp;amp;J had already decided to exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The dream, Malavige said, is simple, “You go to the doctor, get yourself tested, the test is positive, you’re given an antiviral, and that’s the end of the story.” The question is whether patients can get there early enough — and whether mosnodenvir can work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s also the question of resistance. In the human challenge trial, genetic mutations emerged in the virus among nearly all the participants who took mosnodenvir — mutations that could, in theory, make the drug less effective over time. And some dengue strains already circulating in nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52819-z"&gt;appear to be harder to treat&lt;/a&gt; with this type of drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is a real limitation. Mosnodenvir alone probably isn’t a long-term solution, because, eventually, the virus might adapt. But that problem is a familiar one for drug makers. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-drug-resistance"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1403340"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; both evolved resistance to early drugs, and the answer was combination therapy: multiple drugs that attack the virus in different ways, making it far harder to escape all of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For that strategy to work with dengue, though, we need more drugs to combine. Mosnodenvir may not be the whole puzzle, but it could be the first piece. “If people stopped at the first sign of seeing trouble,” Malavige said, “then the world will not progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="could-mosnodenvirget-adopted" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Could Mosnodenvir…get adopted? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s exit follows a well-worn path for big pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the past two decades, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01528.x#:~:text=By%202005%2C%20the%20number%20of,on%20developing%20new%20antimicrobial%20drugs."&gt;Bristol Myers Squibb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/despite-looming-resistance-crisis-novartis-ducks-out-antibiotics-research"&gt;Novartis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://centest.acs.org/articles/93/i10/AstraZeneca-Spin-Off-Antibiotics.html"&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/a&gt;, and other major drugmakers have all scaled back or abandoned infectious disease research, judging that these drugs simply couldn’t compete with cancer and obesity blockbusters. A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e9bd070-a99e-4f1f-bff9-3709007104e1"&gt;recent op-ed in the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; called it a “textbook market failure.” The public health impact is massive, but the financial returns for addressing them aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After J&amp;amp;J’s exit, ownership of mosnodenvir is being transferred back to KU Leuven, the Belgian university where the drug was first discovered before J&amp;amp;J licensed it for development. “We will do all we can to make sure that mosnodenvir is further developed in clinical trials as soon as possible,” said Patrick Chaltin, who directs the university’s drug discovery center. To do that, the university is working with the Wellcome Trust, a major global health funder, to find new partners and funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And fortunately, mosnodenvir isn’t the only dengue drug that the pharmaceutical industry is looking into. The Swiss drug maker Novartis is running a phase 2 treatment trial for a different antiviral, and the Serum Institute in India is testing a monoclonal antibody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Drug development is expensive and uncertain, and the people who need dengue treatments most are not the people who can pay the most.

The latest plant-based hydration beverage on the market is being touted as “the peel good beverage” that offers “a bunch of nutrients.” And it’s drumming up attention on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boyfriend says it has aromatics of slightly overripe banana,” one Reddit user, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/leemoongrass/" target="_blank"&gt;leemoongrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Volumeeating/comments/1asn7px/my_boyfriend_just_came_home_with_this_lmao/?rdt=52704" target="_blank"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “It honestly isn’t that bad.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It smells like baby food,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQXGmLvD9x_/" target="_blank"&gt;lsp2c&lt;/a&gt; said on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with banana water for plants, a DIY fertilizer made by soaking banana peels in water to extract nutrients, such as potassium and vitamin C, for your flora. Or homemade banana drinks, such as hot water &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/270779/hot-banana-water/" target="_blank"&gt;steeped with banana peels&lt;/a&gt; and strained, or blended banana smoothies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new drink, sold in supermarkets, is being marketed as an alternative to sports drinks, a sort of coconut water 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some have taken to social media with questions: “How do you think you juice a banana?!” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tybottofficial/video/7504810072766188830" target="_blank"&gt;tybottofficial&lt;/a&gt; asked on TikTok, while unpacking a box of organic banana water from Woodstock. “I wonder if they’re just in a factory, like, you know, really milking these bananas, I guess?” (He gave the drink a 7.5 out of 10.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.woodstock-foods.com/the-goods/product.organic-banana-water-042563018771.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://banagua.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Banagua&lt;/a&gt;, leading manufacturers of banana water, make their banana water in Thailand from organic “Thai golden” and “Thai cultivated” bananas, which are shorter and stubbier-looking than the standard yellow bananas sold in most American supermarkets and which have a slight pinkish tint. The fruit gets pinker in the processing and the drink has a pinkish hue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a label ogler, the ingredient list will put you at ease. Banana water contains just one ingredient: bananas. There’s no significant water added to it. A banana is 80% water, Banagua co-founder Rob Smithson says, and the processing of the drink (an “enzymatic process”) separates the water from the pulp — the drink is slightly viscous but not pulpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodstock’s bananas are steamed and mashed with “proprietary enzymes” to release nutrients. “Think of it as liquefied bananas,” says Bruce Bruemmer,  vice president of brand management at UNFI Brands+, Woodstock’s parent company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot? Both companies say their banana water is especially healthy, brimming with electrolytes like potassium, B6 and magnesium, as well as minerals and antioxidants such as vitamin A and C. The drink has no added sugar, and zero fat, sodium and cholesterol, though a 330ml can does have about 13 grams of carbohydrates, slightly less than Naked coconut water’s 14 grams in a container of the same size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how healthy &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; banana water, what does it taste like, and is it worth the hype? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manufacturer’s claims:&lt;/b&gt; “Our banana water has 205 mg of magnesium — 50% of the daily value,” Smithson says of Banagua’s Original Banana, which went on the market in July 2025. “And it’s especially hydrating — probably 2-3 bananas per can, which you can bring anywhere and you don’t have to worry about moldy bananas. And just 50 calories — Naked’s coconut water has 60.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodstock’s 500ml can of banana water, which went on the market in March 2024, has just 80 calories. “Our Woodstock Organic Banana Water stands out for its great taste and natural hydration,” Bruemmer says, “delivering 765mg of electrolytes — similar to many sports drinks — without any artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutritionists’ take:&lt;/b&gt; “It’s probably a sequel to coconut water,” says &lt;a class="link" href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014Re56AAC/thomas-g-sherman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Thomas Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University Medical Center. “It would appeal to people who are worried about animal wellness and saturated fat in their milk drinks or who are worried about too high sugar — so this fits the bill. But I question its effectiveness — these types of beverages offer such trivial amounts of electrolytes compared to what’s already in our food. And it’s expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherman says that, in the end, it comes down to the consumer’s intentions for choosing banana water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re buying it because of the taste, and you want to support a plant-based beverage, and [because] it’s fairly low sugar, then fine,” he says. “But if you’re buying it because you’re interested in getting more potassium and magnesium and calcium with low sodium, then it’s silly because just &lt;i&gt;eat plants&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eat food&lt;/i&gt;, that’s going to supply hundreds of times more potassium and calcium and magnesium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorizing banana water as a sports drink is problematic, adds &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" target="_blank"&gt;Vanessa King&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist specializing in supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sports drinks replace electrolytes,” King says. “The problem with banana water is that while bananas are very high in potassium, the electrolyte that you predominantly lose when you exercise is sodium — and it doesn’t provide sodium. I would not choose it over a sports drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King points out that “banana juice,” as she calls it, suffers from the same concerns as other juices: “It’s more concentrated sugar without the fiber you’d get from the fruit version.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any amount of potassium, magnesium, vitamin A and C — all key nutrients in banana water — is helpful, King says. “They’re  all nutrients that are generally under-consumed by Americans. But bananas also have those nutrients!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The taste: &lt;/b&gt;We found it sweet and tropical-tasting, slightly viscous but surprisingly refreshing. However, we didn’t go bananas for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: &lt;/b&gt;Banagua’s Original Banana (330ml): $3.49; Woodstock’s Organic Banana Water (500ml): $2.99.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9JdEkxdUZseDNoN0dEcEVPNTFyV1h3bnFZRWdrUWU1bV9TejFqdWRlSE0zcXNlOThuQ05JQ3BsSDN3Y0hEdzRXZE14Y2xUV1JtRlplUTNybHRtZFRNU0NhWGdVZzJjdTRnR2xERkwyVmx4YzM0eEprMEpiTEM2dw</guid></item><item><title>“Ozempic的作用不仅仅是减少消费，而是价值观的转变” - The Drinks Business</title><link>https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/12/the-role-of-ozempic-isnt-just-about-reduced-consumption-its-about-a-shift-in-values/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-wp c-wp--article mb-6"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic is no longer a background murmur for the drinks trade. It is becoming a decisive force in how consumers approach alcohol, according to Tom Bell, founder of low-calorie alcohol retailer DrinkWell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re beginning to see signs that Ozempic and similar medications are reshaping drinking habits in the UK,” Bell told &lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve spent years tracking how health-driven behaviours influence alcohol consumption, and this is one of the most notable shifts yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell said that consumers using appetite-suppressing medications are drinking less often and choosing more carefully when they do. According to Bell, lower sugar, fewer calories and transparency around ingredients are now key drivers, with DrinkWell seeing a soar in popularity for products positioned around wellness rather than abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This change accelerates a trend we’ve championed since day one,” Bell said. “People don’t necessarily want to cut alcohol out altogether, but they do want choices that fit better with their wellbeing goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An industry playing catch-up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell believes the alcohol sector has lagged behind soft drinks when it comes to health-conscious innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the functional and better-for-you soft drinks category has been inundated with innovation in recent years, the alcohol sector is still years behind,” he said, adding that the continued rise of GLP-1 medications will force long overdue change across drinks and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The role of Ozempic isn’t just about reduced consumption, it’s about a shift in values,” Bell said. “It’s one our industry needs to stay ahead of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His views echo wider market data. As reported by &lt;a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/11/global-alcohol-giants-lose-us830-billion-as-drinking-habits-change/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November 2025, a Gallup survey found that US alcohol consumption fell to its lowest level since records began in 1939. Health warnings from organisations including the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; and the US Surgeon General have weighed particularly heavily on Generation X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For millennials and Gen Z, alcohol’s appeal has waned further, influenced by teetotal celebrities, non-alcoholic alternatives, cannabis and the uptake of weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen four times the impact of the financial crash on alcohol consumption,” said Laurence Whyatt, analyst at Barclays. “The market believes there’s been some sort of structural change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Festive drinking under medical scrutiny&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christmas approaches, medical professionals are offering practical guidance for those combining alcohol with GLP-1 treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Giuseppe Aragona, medical practitioner at Prescription Doctor, told &lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt; that moderation is essential. According to Aragona, excessive drinking can worsen common GLP-1 side effects including nausea, acid reflux, dizziness and vomiting, while also increasing the risk of low blood sugar when appetite is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gastric emptying occurs more slowly among those taking GLP-1 medications,” he said, explaining that alcohol can feel stronger and more unpredictable than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aragona warned of a “perfect storm” created by slowed digestion, reduced appetite and high-calorie festive drinks, which can lead to faster intoxication, more severe hangovers and gastrointestinal upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What to avoid and what to choose&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, Aragona advised limiting or avoiding drinks such as Baileys, sweet cocktails, beer, lager, Guinness, sherry, port, creamy festive cocktails and sour mix cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better tolerated options in moderation include gin with slimline tonic, prosecco or Champagne, vodka with soda and lime, dry white wine, light spritzers and non-alcoholic festive alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food pairing also matters. “Even a small snack can lower the risk of low blood sugar and lessen the gastrointestinal impact of alcohol,” Aragona said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Debra Marcos, medical director at Weight Medics, told &lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt; that alcohol and GLP-1s both slow digestion, making stomach discomfort and blood glucose drops more likely when combined. Marcos advised avoiding sugary mixers and cocktails and listening closely to physical responses such as increased heart rate or digestive discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mindful luxury moves upmarket&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ozempic effect is also reshaping fine dining, according to Palm PR. The agency has identified indulgence with intention as a defining theme for 2026, with smaller appetites driving portion-flexible menus and slower-paced experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Otto’s in London now offers small appetite menus, while Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck is focusing on mindful, bite-sized tasting experiences. New openings such as Island are building portion flexibility into their core concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Keogh, founder of hospitality pr agency Palm, told &lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt; that Ozempic is part of a broader shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s portion flexible tasting menus, indulgent hot chocolate, premium dairy or functional comfort rituals, consumers want experiences that feel joyful, high quality and purposeful,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bars feel the squeeze&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact is already visible at street level. As reported by &lt;em&gt;the drinks business&lt;/em&gt;, the owner of Dallas wine bar Trova Wine and Market cited Ozempic as one factor behind its closure in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owner Michelle Bonds told Dallas Morning Post that while protein-rich food sales found some traction, alcohol consumption and food orders per customer fell as more patrons used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dopamine and desire&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific research suggests a biological explanation. Pharmacologist Elizabet Jerlhag at the University of Gothenburg found that GLP-1 drugs reduced alcohol consumption in rats by over 50%. Studies indicate the drugs suppress dopamine release when alcohol is consumed, dulling the brain’s reward response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Hendershot, psychologist at the University of North Carolina, described this as a “pretty strong signal” while leading clinical trials into how GLP-1 drugs alter drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is increasingly framed as a shortcut to better health, but its growing influence raises questions. A lifestyle shaped by medication rather than choice can feel compliant rather than genuinely healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol abstinence, too, is being cast as a moral good, despite centuries of evidence that moderation, context and quality matter more than simple exclusion. Cutting out drinking does not automatically lead to better nutrition, stronger social bonds or improved mental wellbeing, and in some cases may strip away rituals that bring balance and pleasure. The real challenge for the drinks trade and for consumers is not whether Ozempic or sobriety will save us, but whether health can be pursued without losing autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In February 2026, the drinks business will publish a more detailed analysis of Ozempic and its impact on the drinks trade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Behaviors that would instantly annoy us in people, like loud chewing, often become endearing when a dog does the exact same thing. That mindset is on full display in a video where a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Barney’s crunchy eating habit becomes the highlight rather than the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s loud chewing is just perfect for dog owner in this video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pet ASMR has steadily grown in popularity online, and Barney’s video fits right into that trend. In the short clip, the Golden Retriever is seen happily munching on carrots, producing loud, rhythmic crunching sounds as he eats. His chewing is steady and enthusiastic, clearly showing how much he enjoys his snack. Rather than finding the noise distracting, his owner finds it completely endearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The text displayed on the video sums up the moment perfectly. It reads, “I would lose my mind if a human ate like this… but my dog doing it? Perfection.” The contrast struck a chord with viewers, many of whom agreed that dogs somehow get a free pass for habits that would otherwise be irritating. Barney’s focus and contentment while chewing only add to the charm, making the sound oddly calming instead of overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some viewers said watching a dog eat is one of life’s simple pleasures, while others described the sound as “soul soothing.” One commenter joked that the chewing was so satisfying it could be used as a “ringtone,” while another summed things up by saying anything their own dog does feels perfect too. Many agreed that there’s something uniquely comforting about watching pets enjoy small moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond the satisfying sounds, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-health/dog-food-dog-nutrition/84309-can-dogs-eat-carrots" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carrots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt; themselves are a healthy option for many dogs. Veterinarians often recommend them as a low-calorie snack rich in fiber and vitamins, such as beta-carotene, which supports eye health. Crunchy vegetables can also help promote dental health by reducing plaque buildup. As with any treat, moderation is key, and carrots should be cut into appropriate sizes to avoid choking. For Barney, they seem to be both a nutritious choice and a source of pure happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/199258-golden-retriever-dog-loud-chew-video-instagram" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Owner Says Golden Retriever’s Loud Chewing Is ‘Perfection’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Owner Says Golden Retriever’s Loud Chewing Is ‘Perfection’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:33:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOeG01SWljdWYzMnBkODlNUEFsNnZ4eHdPZVNfdjhkSTFaVUltUkVVdEJHbkkwQW5vVzZhdW03MUJpd192OTNqQ1JCVWw3QmlWZGlXZGltUW1OX3A3eXJ2aTMzc0pQcUlVZEpRM0RScVdfZWZ2cWlHOU5BUFVvSDI4MHhlM3lzVU44MWRKbmF0RXBzSTA</guid></item><item><title>“牡蛎和生肉一样是一种风险” ：为什么会食物中毒–以及如何避免-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/15/why-food-poisoning-how-to-avoid-oysters-raw-meat</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;any people in the modern world, it’s probably fair to say, do not take food poisoning particularly seriously. Yes, most folks wash their hands after handling raw chicken and use different chopping boards for beef and green beans – but who among us can honestly say we’ve never used the same tongs for an entire barbecue or left a storage box of cooked rice on the sideboard for a couple of hours? Ignore that rhetorical question for a moment, though – before you comment that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; everyone should do all those things, let’s talk about what’s happening in your body when it all goes horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the risk of stating the obvious, food poisoning occurs when you eat food contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins – but that doesn’t mean it always works the same way. “Some bacteria, such as &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt; – sometimes found in reheated rice – produce toxins before the food is eaten, meaning they can cause symptoms such as sudden vomiting within hours,” says Dr Masarat Jilani, an NHS specialist who regularly manages children and adults with food poisoning. &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt; also produces another type of toxin in the small intestine, which can cause diarrhoea. “Others, such as &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, act after you’ve eaten and often cause longer-lasting symptoms through inflammation of the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Technically speaking, then, an expert might be able to guess what type of bacteria or virus you have ingested based on how quickly you become ill after eating. But in practical terms, that rarely happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All of these bacteria work in different ways,” says Dr&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Doughty, an infectious disease scientist. “&lt;em&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which you often find in poultry, are spiral-shaped and corkscrew their way through your gut lining. That’s different from, say, Shigatoxigenic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, which excretes Shiga toxins. Both make you sick with gut inflammation and diarrhoea.” This means that, even though there are some effective treatments for food poisoning, such as antibiotics, it is not always easy for doctors to know which to prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’ve got a stomach bug and you go to the doctor, typically they’re not going to give you antibiotics,” says Doughty. “The reason for that is that if you’ve got the Shiga toxin-producing variant of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, and if you then kill all those bugs with antibiotics, they’re just going to release all the toxins inside them and make you even more sick. So without a specific infection diagnosis, it’s quite often safer to just let things get better on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="db3f64c6-20db-4cdc-a10e-3205b1690da3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Beware the bacteria … they can lurk in every crevice.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What should you be doing to avoid all this unpleasantness? “Some of the most classic advice is still relevant,” says Doughty. “Oysters are always a risk, as is eating any kind of raw meat – there’s been a vogue for people to eat medium-rare burgers recently, which is a bit troubling.” To explain: if you are about to eat beef, you need to sear the parts that have been exposed to air to kill most of the bacteria likely to be living on it. With steak, that just means the outside, but with mince, that’s almost all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Washing chicken – still &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/wash-my-chicken" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bizarrely popular on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; – is an absolute no-no, as it’s likely to spread bacteria all over your kitchen and utensils, rather than reducing your chance of infection. Obviously, you should be keeping things clean, keeping raw meat separate from other food, quickly cooling cooked food and refrigerating it within two hours of cooking, and ensuring food is properly cooked, perhaps using a meat thermometer. “As with a lot of other infections, washing your hands is really valuable to prevent getting sick,” says Doughty. “In this case, it means washing your hands thoroughly after handling food, and after using the toilet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If it all goes wrong, most people won’t have too much to worry about, assuming they aren’t in an at-risk population. “The main risk from food poisoning is dehydration, which is why it is important to drink plenty of water and supplement with oral rehydration salts when you are experiencing it,” says Jilani. “Reintroducing a balanced diet is also important for recovery, and in the initial stages we often recommend a Brat diet – bananas, rice, applesauce and toast – if you feel that you can’t reintroduce your normal one straight away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a592d69e-aedd-42f5-8a7e-8ba08bc2f3a7" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Beige food – bananas, rice, applesauce and toast, among other things – is best for an upset stomach.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: a_namenko/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In more extreme cases food poisoning can lead to sepsis, which can include symptoms such as a fast heart rate and light-headedness. If you feel this might be happening, call the GP straight away. “In a minority of cases, you might also develop post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be characterised by abdominal pain and bloating,” says Jilani. Again, see a doctor if it persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The good news is that most cases of food poisoning will clear up on their own in a few days, as your immune system sorts them out. Just be more careful with the tongs next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

   &lt;p&gt;Wellness enthusiasts seeking to hack their way to health and longevity have a new favorite remedy — one that &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahlawuk/video/7140354795554213125?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZP-92AJZMNpvag" target="_blank"&gt;stains their tongues blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue has been around since the 1870s when it was used as a textile dye. Since then it's been prescribed as an antimalarial treatment and an antidote for cyanide poisoning. Today it's&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as treatment for methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But online influencers are promoting it for what they claim are its wellness properties. It's taking off among biohackers, who seek to optimize their health via lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pifmGCPjluM" target="_blank"&gt;Commentators speculated&lt;/a&gt; that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes methylene blue after a video of the nation's top health official circulated early this year. He can be seen using an eyedropper to mix a cobalt blue liquid into a cup of water. Kennedy never confirmed what he was taking, though the vibrant color and applicator resembles the methylene blue products that are sold by online retailers. And Kennedy's known for &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/rfk-jr-takes-his-vitamins-but-this-vitamin-industry-ceo-isnt-sure-hes-an-ally-00476806" target="_blank"&gt;taking supplements&lt;/a&gt;, and has a track record of embracing debunked or unproven scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Claim:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue improves the function of mitochondria — components of our cells which convert nutrients into energy — and that results in a host of benefits, such as slowed aging, better mood and sharper cognition. Some even claim it alleviates jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab studies and animal trials have found that methylene blue can help cells make energy more efficiently by giving mitochondria an easier way to move electrons when their normal pathways are damaged or stressed, says Lorne Hofseth, who studies dyes' effect on cancer and inflammation at the University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He also cites studies done in rodents and worms to show that methylene blue improves brain energy use, reduces inflammation, and protects against neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to research in humans, there have been several smaller trials in select populations that have shown antidepressant or cognitive benefits from pure methylene blue. But Hofseth says these findings remain preliminary — which is why he strongly discourages people from taking it as a supplement, as right now, the risks outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You're wasting your money," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean methylene blue is a total scientific dead end. Hofseth points to promising work being done in the UK on a modified form of the dye to treat Alzheimer's disease. But this methylene blue is different from the dye people are purchasing as an over the counter supplement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So why might online influencers feel convinced that methylene blue makes them feel better and think faster?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Cognition is subjective," says Nicole Brandt, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy who studies geriatric pharmacotherapy. "We have good and bad days if we sleep well, if we eat well."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to wasting money, Hofseth and Brandt both warn of adverse side effects from methylene blue. That includes serotonin toxicity, which is a serious drug reaction, which can cause elevated blood pressure, diarrhea, seizures, and even death: People who take certain antidepressants, including Zoloft and Lexapro, are especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4091817/" target="_blank"&gt;could also be dangerous for&lt;/a&gt; people who have a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/" target="_blank"&gt;genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; affecting red blood cells called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another concern is people may not know what they're getting when they buy methylene blue over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really don't have good oversight, or any oversight to nutritional supplements and what's in them," Brandt says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike drugs, supplements are not approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy before they go on the market. But they do have to follow certain rules around labeling. Manufacturers are also subject to inspection, and the FDA monitors safety concerns once products are on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, federal regulators have finite resources and are unable to catch every bad actor, says Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former principal deputy commissioner at the FDA. That's why he says it's buyer beware with methylene blue, and similar products&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The internet is a big place," he told NPR. "There are a lot of products for sale that are not safe."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also not clear whether methylene blue meets the regulatory definition of a supplement. It's listed in an FDA database as a generic drug that requires a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And most methylene blue products are not in a federal registry of dietary supplement labels, according to Jeff Ventura, vice president for communications at the Council for Responsible Nutrition. Many of the products seen online are not explicitly identified as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA did not respond to a request for comment about how it's possible for online retailers to sell methylene blue without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who still want to try methylene blue should first talk to a clinician to ensure they're not at risk for adverse side effects. And if someone's taking methylene blue for a specific health concern, like brain fog or fatigue, a primary care provider can also help address those issues, says Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you do decide to try the product, be warned: It could turn your teeth, tongue and urine bright blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A few years ago, researchers at labs and companies reported they had engineered viruses that could ferry corrective genes deep into the brain, giving potential entry to a new world of treatments for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and a slew of rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This summer, after years of careful study, the first person underwent gene therapy using one of the new viruses. The patient, a young child, died two and a half days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The death has sent concern and uncertainty rippling through labs and companies developing gene therapies for the brain, along with rare disease groups who hoped these tools could deliver long-sought cures. They worry that Capsida Biotherapeutics unearthed a broader risk for other viruses designed to travel like a messenger pigeon to our brains, one that could derail years of progress. &lt;/p&gt;

The cell is our unit of life and of medicine. When a normal cell becomes malignant, it does not merely divide faster; it eats differently. It hoards glucose, reroutes amino acids, siphons lipids, and improvises when a pathway is blocked. We have learned to poison its DNA, to derail its signaling, to enlist T cells as sentinels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have been slower to ask a simpler question that sits at the cell’s kitchen table: What if we change what a tumor can eat?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a century, metabolism was oncology’s prologue. In the 1920s, Otto Warburg observed that many cancer cells consume glucose voraciously and convert much of that glucose to lactate even when oxygen is plentiful, a seemingly wasteful choice that became a metabolic signature of malignancy. That insight eventually receded into a footnote while genetics took the stage. But tumors are not static genotypes; they are shape-shifters that adapt to therapy by rewiring their fuel lines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if we want longer and deeper responses, the clinic has to treat metabolism as a first-class target. That means moving from one-size-fits-all “cancer diets” that tell nearly every patient to cut “sugar,” avoid white bread and pasta, drink green juices, or adopt alkaline regimens, regardless of tumor type, treatment, or physiology. Instead, oncologists should move to tumor-informed metabolism: interventions matched to the biology of a patient’s tumor, to the drug it is receiving, and to the body in which both reside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider a woman in her 50s with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer whose tumor carries a PIK3CA mutation. She receives a PI3K inhibitor alongside endocrine therapy. At first, the drug seems to hold; the scans steady, the markers fall. Then, over months, the cancer advances again. Blood work shows the clue: glucose and insulin levels, driven high by the drug’s effect on insulin signaling, have opened a back door for the tumor. The escape is not written in her genome; it is metabolically improvised.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So alongside the drug, she is given a dietary plan that trades sweetened drinks, desserts, and refined starches for slow-digesting carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, crafted to blunt those insulin spikes, a protocol timed around dosing, calibrated to her physiology, monitored with real-time metabolic biomarkers. The tumor’s escape hatch narrows; the response deepens; the remission lasts longer. What made the difference was not drug alone or diet alone, but the braid of the two into a single therapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Metabolism is where ecology meets oncology. A tumor shares and competes for nutrients with its microenvironment. It burns different fuels in the liver than in the lungs. It shifts when a PI3K inhibitor raises insulin, and it shifts again if hyperglycemia follows steroids. Asparagine is dispensable for some cells, essential for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is why depleting it works. Serine and glycine can become growth linchpins in certain breast and colorectal cancers. Methionine restriction alters one-carbon flux in ways that make some tumors more susceptible to therapy. None of this is folklore. It is cell biology in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tumor-informed metabolism treats food as information. For a patient receiving a PI3K-pathway inhibitor, this might mean flattening post-meal glucose and insulin peaks. For a colorectal tumor that depends on particular amino acids, it might mean restricting those substrates during a course of chemotherapy or radiation. For a patient wasting away on treatment, it might mean adding calories and protein precisely because loss of weight and muscle would blunt the very therapy we hope will work. It begins with what the tumor uses, where it lives, which drug is acting upon it, and how the host responds. It is time-bound and measurable. It is designed to make a pharmacologic mechanism work better, not to replace it. It is delivered as precisely as a medication, with safeguards for weight, strength, and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my work as a co-founder of &lt;a href="http://faeththerapeutics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Faeth Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, my colleagues and I build such regimens prospectively, pairing diets with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in endometrial cancer, amino acid-restricted diets in rectal cancer, and scripting each plan around a specific mechanism and treatment window. Our intention, however, is less to advance a single company than to suggest a new template for how oncology might use food as a co-therapeutic instrument. I would welcome more companies designing similarly rigorous nutrition–drug regimens and submitting them to randomized trials, and I believe sponsors and regulators will eventually have to treat diet as a prespecified element of the protocol rather than an unmeasured backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field is still in its infancy. There are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0343-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;encouraging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22056" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;signals&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-025-03035-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;model systems&lt;/a&gt; in which pathway-directed drugs, such as PI3K inhibitors or chemotherapy/radiotherapy, have been combined with insulin-lowering or amino acid-modifying diets, but there are also failures when diets are generic, prolonged, or divorced from drug mechanism. Many patients lose weight during chemotherapy; some have diabetes; others fast zealously and end up weaker. Tumor-informed metabolism is an antidote to both nihilism and zeal. It treats nutrition as a targeted adjuvant rather than a belief system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What will it take to make this part of standard care? The studies must be prospective, controlled, and anchored to a drug’s mechanism. Endpoints must be objective: response rates, survival gains, dose intensity preserved, and toxicity reduced. An intervention that shifts these curves deserves to be integrated into routine practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But evidence alone is not enough. We will need clinical structures that can hold and act on that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;First, we will need multimodal regimens in pathways such as PI3K that shut down signaling without collapsing the immune response, avoiding the brittleness of single-node inhibitors and the collateral damage of indiscriminate blockade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, we will need precision nutrition, not as lifestyle advice but as therapy: food scripted to complement a drug’s mechanism and to close the metabolic escapes the drug itself can provoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third, we will need what might be called a metabolic operating system, a computational model of metabolism that lets us predict flux, anticipate resistance, and explore combinations in silico before they are carried into patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without the unity of drug, precision nutrition, and model, tumor-informed metabolism remains a hypothesis. With it, medicine begins to see metabolism as a stratum of biology as fundamental as DNA or protein, but more immediate, revealing a cell’s state in seconds rather than years. “Feed the patient, starve the tumor” is not a slogan but a clinical directive, to be written with the same specificity as a chemotherapy order: macronutrient and micronutrient targets, timing, and contraindications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There will be skepticism. Some will argue that metabolism is too plastic to trap, or that its contribution will be marginal. But oncology has always been built on combinations in which agents acting through different mechanisms, together, produce results greater than the sum of their parts: targeted drugs layered on chemotherapy, immunotherapies paired with radiation, and supportive drugs that preserve dose intensity and keep patients on treatment. If a tumor-informed plan buys three more cycles of a drug before resistance, that is not incidental to the person living those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others will raise concerns about equity. They are right. If metabolism becomes a precision tool, it must be delivered as one: covered, accessible, adapted to diverse kitchens and cultures, not relegated to concierge care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deeper reason to do this is not tactical but philosophical. If the cell is the unit of life, then metabolism is the first verb in its sentence. We already intervene at the genome and the immunome. We should not ignore the part that feeds both. The clinic is where this becomes more than an idea. It becomes a plan the patient can taste, and a plan the tumor cannot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer medicine has always advanced by expanding what counts as therapy. We once thought cures would come only from sharper scalpels and stronger poisons. Then we learned to listen to T cells. Now we must listen to the hungers and handicaps of malignant cells, and use them. The next generation of combination therapy will not be drug plus drug alone. It will be drug plus metabolism, food braided with pharmacology, so that a tumor cannot simply sidestep us on a different substrate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We will still sequence tumors. We will still give the best drugs we have. We will still sit with our patients on the hard days. But we can also do something elemental that does not subtract from strength or dignity. We can feed the person and starve the cancer, on purpose. That is an old idea made new by the precision of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone's gut microbiome is different, so there's no model for what a perfectly healthy one looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="01fc1652-fb16-4b9a-a088-ffe23a8edab5" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 1. Eat gut-friendly foods &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/is-fibermaxxing-new-protein-goals-asked-nutrition-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;foods with a lot of fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber should be removed from your gut or eaten in lower amounts. "These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="5ac7a098-85ca-486b-b30b-0c2980f6f670" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 2. Make note of the medications you're taking &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a target="_self" data-id="dce02fc7-a605-4e78-86af-53300e39ae08" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a target="_self" data-id="dce02fc7-a605-4e78-86af-53300e39ae08" href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the pH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="c876917b-a21c-44df-9743-beeb169eaa5b" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has its own method of action."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking them for bowel regularity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever your problem is," she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="90970c8c-7c40-4c77-9db1-2c50c03fa448" data-ng-block="{"&gt; 4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a data-id="74795062-398a-4c91-a327-5038c8b42238" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are small ways you can get your body in the habit of moving every day or at least more frequently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too. So, if we eat when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to process the nutrients of our food properly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, including exercising or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which affect our gut health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 09:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVDg5NlJkY3RId2RsdVJDOFA2VlNVdmVadjJPalZjdVNuc3hNenNjQ0gxaUlJa0J5bkRCVkJqZ2NWUHpzTi1nR1Q0a09OZ2RPT3hITlRuMkJYaHotYXNWdHR0emlQNUh4WUdsdFRBbTIzMW1tLW5fSkZaVTVvV2FhczZmTzRmaTNnbVlHX3Vn</guid></item><item><title>凯拉什医院心脏病专家分享了心脏健康的最佳饮食红旗： “吃太多腌菜，手帕......” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kailash-hospital-cardiologist-shares-top-diet-red-flags-for-heart-health-too-much-pickle-papad-raises-blood-pressure-101765782616719.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/kailash-hospital-cardiologist-shares-top-diet-red-flags-for-heart-health-too-much-pickle-papad-raises-blood-pressure-101765782616719.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;With half of the last month of 2025 already gone and 2026 just a fortnight away, it's the perfect time to reconsider your lifestyle habits so you can modify them and begin the year with a positive note and healthy lifestyle habits.&lt;/span&gt; One of the most preliminary lifestyle changes you can make is improving your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/adding-avocado-to-diet-5-delicious-recipes-to-try-creamy-spaghetti-greek-farm-salad-crab-stuffed-avocado-and-more-101757408211556.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;What you eat has a very significant impact on your heart, and given how heart diseases are on the rise in India, it is the need of the hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/15/550x309/pickles_1765784984759_1765784984910.jpg" alt="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/15/550x309/pickles_1765784984759_1765784984910.jpg" alt="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Eating too much pickle puts stress on your heart!(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-hospital-cardiologist-reveals-4-sleeping-habits-for-good-heart-health-no-caffeine-after-2-pm-and-more-101762690120166.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Apollo Hospital cardiologist reveals 4 sleeping habits for good heart health: No caffeine after 2 PM and more"&gt;Apollo Hospital cardiologist reveals 4 sleeping habits for good heart health: No caffeine after 2 PM and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To understand how you can take better precautions and know if your diet is a green/red flag for your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-how-a-39-year-old-man-christmas-party-indulgence-ended-with-severe-heart-failure-101765785015746.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health, HT Lifestyle spoke to Dr Sunil Kumar Mandal, consultant cardiologist at Kailash Hospital, Greater Noida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why is it imperative to pay attention to what's on your plate? As per the cardiologist, there's an alarming rise in heart diseases. “Indians are developing heart diseases nearly 10–15 years earlier than most Western populations,” Dr Mandal said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the hidden risks in the modern Indian diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat may seem harmless, and even staple in the Indian diet, but it may quietly be putting your heart at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mandal warned against excessively deep-fried food in oil. “&lt;span&gt;Excessive intake of saturated and trans fats is one particular concern. High intakes of ghee, butter, and vanaspati with frequent consumption of fried snacks such as samosas, pakoras, and puris result in high bad cholesterol levels.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates are again a part of everyday meals, from morning to night. But there's a big risk in eating them daily, as they put stress on your heart through repeated insulin spikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist elaborated, “White rice, maida-containing bread, and sweet preparations are responsible for hyperglycemic spikes, leading subsequently to insulin resistance and predisposing towards diabetes and cardiac problems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sodium and irregular patterns also contribute to many heart problems. Dr Mandal warned about favourites like pickles and papads.&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;“Eating too much pickles, papads, packaged chutneys, and processed snacks leads to high intake of sodium adds to this burden by raising blood pressure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also need to be careful about the timing of your meals, as eating erratically may increase stress on the cardiovascular system. Similarly, large portions can have the same effect, according to the cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What should you eat for healthy heart?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/21/550x309/walnut_1761018345598_1761018345838.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat a handful of nuts and seeds to improve your heart health.

(Picture credit: Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what should you instead prioritise for better heart health? The cardiologist urged focusing on a balanced diet. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mandal elaborated on the nutrients, “Your plate should be colourful and rich in fruits, vegetables, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fish, to provide nutrients, antioxidants, and fibre that will keep your heart functioning optimally.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that you need to substitute? Yes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mandal shared, “Substitute unhealthy fats with healthy fats to keep our heart healthy and regularly switch to the use of whole grains, in place of refined grain products, like whole wheat, brown rice, millet, etc&lt;/span&gt;, to keep our cholesterol down and stabilise our blood sugar level.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the cooking method, Dr Mandal strongly recommended going for steaming, baking, and roasting instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, he also reiterated the importance of portion control, noting that eating smaller portions helps keep the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

He notes, “Whoever invented the term morning sickness is a filthy liar. There's nothing mourning about it. It's more like 24/7 life sickness. The worst subscription service you never signed up for.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the surgeon adds that, somewhat ironically, morning sickness has been linked to better pregnancy outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He explains that preliminary research suggests nausea and vomiting are associated with a lower risk of pregnancy loss and improved foetal outcomes, although the evidence has limitations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Rajan explains, “This may be because morning sickness correlates with a higher level of hCG, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, as well as oestrogen and progesterone. All these hormones are associated with a well-developing placenta. And all of these hormones are associated with nausea pathways in the brain and/or gut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nausea hacks that might help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Rajan shares some strategies that helped his pregnant wife manage morning sickness, which she experienced predominantly during her first trimester. He suggests, “Bland food like toast or crackers first thing in the morning actually helps since nausea is worsened by an empty stomach. Similarly, nibbling something edible periodically and grazing with smaller, more frequent meals was more helpful than three larger meals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also highlights ginger as an effective way to manage morning sickness, along with certain anti-nausea supplements. The surgeon recommends, “Ginger in tea form, candy chews, or even raw help, because the gingerol chemicals have a GI effect. My wife didn't use these, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/rujuta-diwekar-suggests-4-must-have-foods-during-navratri-fasting-bananas-for-vitamin-b6-to-cashews-for-magnesium-101758605494186.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vitamin B6"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt; supplements and doxylamine are safe to take in pregnancy and are useful anti-nausea aids.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
