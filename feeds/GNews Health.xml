    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a lot of misinformation about supplements,' Koff told the Daily Mail. 'There is no "nature's Ozempic," there's no supplement that works exactly like the medications do because [medications] stay working for 24 hours, for seven days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are a couple [supplements] on the market that are helping our bodies have more GLP-1, but nothing that would compare to a medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Berberine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berberine is a yellow plant-derived compound found in herbs like barberry and Oregon grape. Long used in herbal medicine for infections and digestive issues, it is now sold in supplement form for blood sugar, cholesterol and weight control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Costing between $10 and $50 per bottle, berberine is a type of bitter, meaning it stimulates the body's bitter taste receptors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stimulating these receptors in the gut triggers cells in this area to release more GLP-1, adding on to the benefits of a weight loss shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they stimulate the bitter taste receptors, that's going to help our own body's hormones,' Koff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, berberine has been shown to interact with medications that control blood pressure and cholesterol, so doctors recommend caution if you are taking one of those drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ashley Koff (pictured) cautioned that while supplements may enhance GLP-1 production, there is no 'nature's Ozempic'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Probiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Probiotics are 'good' bacteria naturally found in the gut and in fermented foods such as kimchi, doenjang and kefir.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been shown to promote healthy digestion and help the body absorb vital nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Koff specifically pointed to Akkermansia muciniphila, which has been shown to strengthen the intestinal barrier and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mucinophilia means it likes mucin, so it goes in and it chews up the mucin and the mucosal layer,' Koff said. 'In doing that, it's going to help to stimulate the production of GLP-1.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila does not directly come from food, but its growth in the gut and can be boosted by eating foods rich in polyphenols such as berries, green tea and dark chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also available as a supplement in pill or gummy form, costing anywhere from $20 to $80 per bottle depending on the brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Glutamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Koff's book, which was released on January 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Koff also recommended glutamine, the most abundant of 20 amino acids in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the body produces its own, it can also be found in animal products like beef, chicken, fish, eggs, milk, yogurt and cheese, as well as plant-based sources such as legumes, spinach and whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a supplement, bottles with 60 to 180 capsules tend to cost anywhere from $10 to $35. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glutamine is also available as a powder, with prices ranging from $10 to $40 depending on the size and brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar to berberine, glutamine in food or supplement form triggers intestinal cells to secrete additional GLP-1.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been shown to help strengthen intestinal lining, which helps lower inflammation that could otherwise interfere with GLP-1 signaling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Amarasate &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hailing from New Zealand hops, Amarasate is, much like berberine, a natural bitter extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sold as an appetite control supplement, a 90-capsule bottle costs about $70 to $90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar to berberine, Koff explained the supplement stimulates bitter taste receptors that trigger the natural release of GLP-1, promoting feelings of fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Koff told the Daily Mail that Amarasate may be particularly useful for people coming off a GLP-1 agonist like Ozempic or Wegovy since it naturally stimulates hormone production with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amarasate also works to reduce hunger in as little as 30 minutes, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Your Best Shot: The Personalized System for Optimal Weight Health - GLP-1 Shot or Not is available now through Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, HarperCollins Publishers and others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The disease most often infects wild water fowl such as geese and ducks but also can also infect raptors, corvids (ravens and crows) and mammals, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Songbirds do not appear to be very susceptible, the state says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease can be passed to domestic birds such as chicken and even to cattle. Occasionally humans who have had direct contact with an infected animal — usually farmworkers at chicken or diary facilities — can be infected. Severe illness is not common, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no known cases of bird flu in humans in New York, the agency said. "While avian influenza continues to affect wildlife, the risk to humans remain low," state Health Commissioner James McDonald said in a statement earlier this month. "New Yorkers can stay safe by avoiding contact with sick or dead birds and animals and reporting anything unusual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include sneezing or nasal discharge, lethargy, neurologic problems such as stargazing or seizures, diarrhea and weakness. The disease generally peaks in the winter months, according to the DEC. There is no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts advise that people should not touch a dead bird and to keep pets away as well. If it’s necessary to move a bird, wear gloves and a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If residents find a dead bird, the town of Huntington asks that they call the town's animal control at 631-754-8722.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible avian flu cases can also be reported in the &lt;a class="nd-link" href="https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/dee381c0ee8a4114a83dc1892fc0f7ed"&gt;DEC’s online form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Newsday</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:44:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQbTFLQi1DYzR5alBPLWJNOFRHNVRDS0s5emZLTUlLNHRodC01ZU1YeS1zQmk5eVdlRl9uNTZXRko3UGNnRTctdldNUm83UXFLczd5dldweXctUXlOMXNzUndfdm9FUFp4WTRYSTZHRXRkZHFFM3VrLXhjZTFzaTFFdnBHTkhDVGFxYlBvYg</guid></item><item><title>什么是“代谢健康” ，为什么它很重要？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/what-is-metabolic-health-and-why-does-it-matter/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQUUIyaS05T2ZrMnJ1TE1FSjZqVGh0ZFJSSngtTS1ENVl2aldjQl9fQkpYMV93NHdOYlBmQnUybU94SXlySmhZTklmY3NzV25TUTRTY3pJYmR6bmhlWFdpaXhKck1RUEtCRE1UM096a2NZRlJMakpjRUtxRWdJNXdZTGNhZmM5SU83dGJzUnN5Q0hvdnps?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What is ‘metabolic health,’ and why does it matter?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2k2bC1DdUVCSDJkSFFEWmY3VC1DZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 19:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQUUIyaS05T2ZrMnJ1TE1FSjZqVGh0ZFJSSngtTS1ENVl2aldjQl9fQkpYMV93NHdOYlBmQnUybU94SXlySmhZTklmY3NzV25TUTRTY3pJYmR6bmhlWFdpaXhKck1RUEtCRE1UM096a2NZRlJMakpjRUtxRWdJNXdZTGNhZmM5SU83dGJzUnN5Q0hvdnps</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州爆发克莱姆森大学主校区麻疹确诊病例- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/lifestyles/health/confirmed-measles-case-clemson-university-jan-18-2026/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

					&lt;/p&gt;

					
						&lt;p&gt;A case of measles was confirmed at Clemson University, according to the school. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://news.clemson.edu/confirmed-case-of-measles-on-clemson-main-campus/"&gt;press release published&lt;/a&gt; Saturday, Clemson officials were informed by the South Carolina Department of Public Health that an individual affiliated with the university was confirmed to have measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This person has been isolated per the department's requirements, and the department is conducting contact tracing with people who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The release added that according to the most recent data from Clemson's Student Health Services, nearly 98% of main campus students have provided proof of immunity. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A person infected with measles is contagious four days before and after a rash begins. Isolation of an actively infectious case lasts until four full days have passed after the onset of the rash, and dates of isolation are determined by DPH. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Quarantine for measles is reserved for exposed individuals without documented immunity and lasts for 21 days after the last exposure per DPH guidelines. If a person without documented immunity receives a dose of the MMR vaccine within 72 hours after the last exposure, they do not have to quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This announcement by the university comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/ap/5fe1a-measles-cases-jump-again-in-south-carolina-rising-to-more-than-550/"&gt;midst of a surge in reported measles cases in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. As of Friday, Jan. 16, cases surged by almost 30%, according to state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina health department reported 124 new cases since last Tuesday, bringing the state's total to 558 in a wave of infections centered around an outbreak in Spartanburg County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Since the holidays, South Carolina's measles outbreak has exploded into the worst in the U.S. Measles also have been reported this year in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Virginia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

"It remains possible this flu season may ultimately be categorized as high severity as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC reported a slight dip in the number of lab-confirmed flu cases in the first week of 2026, compared to the last week of 2025, Madad told Live Science that it's "too early to declare we are past the peak."

The CDC also noted that the small drop in confirmed cases could be linked to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;expected decreases in doctor visits and testing during the holidays&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not an actual drop in flu spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="0b8fe7a5-084e-48bb-ab1f-5e956fdb47fe"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is subclade K?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the talk about this year's flu season has centered on something called "subclade K."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what this is, it's important to know that flu viruses are constantly evolving, gaining small genetic mutations as they spread. Scientists keep track of how flu viruses change using a system similar to a family tree, Madad said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big branches of this tree are called "types." This includes influenza A and B, which are broad groups of flu viruses. These big branches sprout off into smaller branches called subtypes, such as A(H3N2) or B/Victoria lineage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters H and N, which are used to differentiate influenza A subtypes, stand for two proteins on the virus's surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are many possible versions of each protein — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;18 and 11 versions, respectively&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which consequently gives rise to a large variety of flu viruses, of which only a few routinely infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going even further down a branch, scientists identify "clades," which are groups of viruses that came from a common ancestor and share similar genetic traits. A subclade is an even smaller group within a clade — a newer "twig" on the tree — that shares recent mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This flu season, the CDC reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most flu cases are being caused by the influenza subtype A(H3N2)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Of the more than 430 samples of influenza A(H3N2) virus collected since late September 2025, over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;91% were identified as part of a closely related group called subclade K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="94b8df27-c4ef-4fc9-a6f4-8e30e853e6b4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is subclade K a "super flu"?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subclade K carries distinct mutations in parts of the virus that our immune systems usually recognize, Madad said. Because of this, our immunity from past flu infections or vaccinations is lower than it might be if the subclade looked more "familiar." This enables the virus to spread more easily, resulting in more cases and, as a result, more hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that does not automatically mean subclade K is more deadly or causes more severe illness than other circulating flu viruses, Madad said. Current epidemiologic data show that subclade K does not lead to more severe disease than other seasonal flu strains than are spreading now, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Flu symptoms this year are similar to those seen in previous seasons," Abdelnour added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the flu commonly experience fever or chills, cough, nasal congestion, muscle and/or body aches, headaches and fatigue. In severe cases, flu infections can lead to complications such as sepsis and pneumonia. Adults 65 and up; young children, especially those under 2; pregnant people; and people with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart disease are at highest risk for severe flu complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="15787d1f-02c3-4f0b-85af-902cef030c3f"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is this year's flu vaccine working, and is it too late to get it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine "may be a less perfect match for subclade K" than it could be, Madad said, but she stressed that vaccination still plays a critical role in preventing serious illness. Abdelnour said that the annual flu vaccine reduces the risk of serious complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia and significant neurologic symptoms, such as seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Southern Hemisphere, which experiences flu season before the Northern Hemisphere, suggests that this year's flu vaccine works just as well as past vaccines at lowering the risk of being hospitalized with the flu, Abdelnour said. This past flu season, the flu vaccine reduced flu-related doctor visits and hospitalizations by 50% in the Southern Hemisphere, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a3.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a3.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC report published in September 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is within the typical range, and it's anticipated we should experience similar levels of protection in the United States," Abdelnour said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, fewer people are getting vaccinated against the flu this year, and that's especially true of children, Madad said. "Only about 42% of U.S. children have received the flu vaccine so far this season, down from roughly 53% at the same point in 2019–2020." As of Jan. 3, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;44.1% of adults reported having received a flu vaccination&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor vaccination rates can have real consequences, Madad said. During the 2024-2025 flu season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;280 children in the U.S. died of flu-related illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and of those, about 9 in 10 had not been vaccinated against the virus. Madad, who is also a mother of four, noted that all of her children receive the flu shot every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though flu season started in the fall, "it is not too late to get the flu shot," Abdelnour emphasized. "Given the current surge in cases, getting vaccinated now is strongly recommended to protect yourself and those around you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madad echoed that advice, urging anyone who hasn't yet received a flu shot this season to do so, especially adults ages 65 and older, pregnant people, those with weakened immune systems, and people living with chronic health conditions, who are at higher risk of severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="041d126b-e6c4-440b-9f19-4d4a3ba460bb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How else can you protect yourself from flu?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is just one layer of protection. Madad emphasized wearing a well-fitting mask in crowded indoor spaces and improving ventilation for indoor gatherings. Additionally, people should stay home when sick to avoid the risk of spreading flu to others. These steps help limit the spread not only of flu, but of other respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/rsv" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/rsv"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RSV&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (respiratory syncytial virus), as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour also noted the importance of practicing proper hand hygiene. "Special attention should be given to childcare environments such as schools and daycare centers," she said. "This includes recommending children get their flu shot, encouraging handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and keeping children home when they are ill to prevent the spread of infection to others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="9e2684ae-1104-4d1a-b4a3-dd99db9c9a82"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are there treatments for flu?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who do get sick, antiviral medications such as Tamiflu can help. These prescription drugs can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/antiviral-drugs.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/antiviral-drugs.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the time you are sick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially when taken within the first day or two after symptoms begin. Evidence suggests they can be &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/hospitalized-patients-with-flu-need-tamiflu-the-day-theyre-admitted-cdc-says" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/hospitalized-patients-with-flu-need-tamiflu-the-day-theyre-admitted-cdc-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;especially helpful to people hospitalized for flu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id="d29dfe78-f795-4148-8368-1730a38a4e44"&gt;The CDC recommends prompt treatment for people with suspected flu symptoms who are at increased risk of serious flu complications, including pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions, such as asthma, lung disease, diabetes, or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gMcYSfmZ9B8NxP8DC42BKU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gMcYSfmZ9B8NxP8DC42BKU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madad said that flu antivirals are "underused" and reminds people at high risk of severe flu or who are caring for someone who is high risk to ask their doctors about antivirals shortly after they suspect an infection. The good news is that current data show subclade K is still responsive to the standard antiviral medications doctors use for influenza, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="a4d1e963-6ac7-4fe1-a3d4-810e8e7197e0"&gt;

Now, he is the first in that small group of pioneers to receive a human kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm the first one that went across the bridge. … I'm the only person in the world that's ever had a pig kidney and then had a human kidney after it," he told CNN from the hospital on Thursday. "Nobody's ever been across that bridge. That is cool!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews, who has diabetes and was living with end-stage kidney disease, received a pig kidney on Jan. 25, 2025, and lived with it for a record 271 days. After his body rejected the organ, it was removed in October, and Andrews returned to dialysis — a grueling process that kept him alive but made him so miserable it had driven him to the experimental xenotransplant in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cried," said Andrews, 67. He told his family he didn't expect to make it through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at nearly midnight on Jan. 12, Mass General Brigham called to tell him that a human kidney — a near-perfect match — had been identified. He was scheduled for transplant surgery at 8 a.m. the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews now expects to be discharged to his home in New Hampshire on Friday, just days after the milestone organ transplant that made him a living example of the promise of xenotransplantation: Organs from animals may help keep humans alive and healthy enough for a longer-term solution and a new shot at life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An answer to organ shortages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenotransplantation – the transplant of different species' organs – has been touted as a possible solution to the current shortage of organ donors. The transplanted pig organs are genetically modified to control for rejection and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any given time in the U.S., there are more than 100,000 people waiting for an organ, about 80% of them in need of kidneys. But only the sickest of the sick are listed; just &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831874#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 8&lt;/a&gt; patients with end-stage renal disease are on the waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;more than 800,000 people with kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 70% are on dialysis. But dialysis is trying to compress into just a few hours every week the work that the body typically does 24/7. The five-year survival rate for patients on dialysis hovers around &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2824363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;40%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dialysis is not able to reproduce what the body needs in terms of clearing the waste," said Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General Brigham Hospital and Andrews' doctor. "It has a huge burden on the patient, both in their quality of life, but most importantly on their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews was hooked up to a dialysis machine three days a week for up to six hours at a time. Six months after starting dialysis for the first time, he had a heart attack. "It takes a toll on you emotionally and physically; you just get exhausted and I got sick. I was throwing up all the time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While organs remain in short supply, Riella sees xenotransplantation as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if it is a bridge," Riella said, "it would be better than (Tim) just staying on dialysis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prepare Andrews for the human transplant, the team at Mass General tested Andrews for new antibodies that could potentially react with the new human kidney and found none. His most recent transplant took just about three hours, and he said his new immunosuppressant regimen is about a third of what he took when he had a pig kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'This will do something for humanity'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Andrews, getting the xenotransplant wasn't just a matter of hope away from dialysis but hope for patients with end-stage renal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will do something for humanity," he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the documentary "Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: Animal Pharm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following his xenotransplant last year, Andrews felt different. "I was clear. I was not what I call dialysis foggy. I wasn't tired or anything. All of a sudden, I had energy," he remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the path forward had ups and downs. Andrews took 52 pills a day to help keep his pig kidney, which he named Wilma, and his immune system in agreement. Ultimately, over the course of nine months, the kidney began showing signs of rejection. He had two infections. Riella said they adjusted Andrews' immunosuppressant protocol, but the kidneys had become damaged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was some damage to the filters of the kidney that, unfortunately, were not reversible," Riella said. Ultimately, they removed Wilma, and Andrews had to return to dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Curtis, president and CEO of eGenesis, the company that provided the donor pig for Andrews' kidney, said it was a slow rejection that scientists could see coming for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just could not figure out how to how to push it back," Curtis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But biopsies and research into Andrews and the pig kidney may have helped them pinpoint what led to the rejection, which may help future kidney recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a much better idea of what was causing that low-level rejection, so we can then tune the suppression," Curtis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrews' experience has helped refine treatment for the next xenotransplant patients. Since his surgery in January 2025, Mass General and eGenesis have teamed up to perform two more xenotransplants before starting a clinical trial in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An alternative to dialysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Riella also sees the xenotransplant as a success for Andrews. Wilma was able to keep him off dialysis for nine months. After Andrews returned to dialysis, his overall function dropped again, and he was losing muscle mass and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Riella said, the comparison of xenotransplant may not be to a human kidney but to dialysis. "It's a much better treatment to maintain the kidney function compared to what dialysis is able to offer," he said. "Our goal is to basically ban dialysis as a long-term treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an alternative to dialysis isn't the end goal, said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. Montgomery wasn't involved in Andrews' care, but has also been at the forefront of the field of xenotransplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As this gets better and xenografts last longer, it will be a destination," said Montgomery, who was the first doctor to transplant pig organs into brain- dead patients and is leading the &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/first-gene-edited-pig-kidney-transplant-clinical-trial-begins-nyu-langone-health" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;first FDA-cleared clinical trial into xenotransplant at NYU.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery believes that xenotransplantation will be a viable solution for patients within the next five years. "In the future, I think a single patient with renal failure will cycle through both xenografts and allografts throughout their lifetime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riella says it's impossible to know what would have happened to Andrews if he had not tried an experimental xenotransplant. But Andrews said he has no doubt that Wilma was key to getting him to this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I didn't take Wilma, I'd have been dead by now. I wasn't gonna make it another year," Andrews said. "I'm looking at years now. I can think ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he's thinking of now is sharing his own story and urging others to become organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People need to step up and help," Andrews said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1409657407616008" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; Andrews posted to social media on Friday, he thanked the family of his donor, who has not been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I grieve with you. It's got to tear you apart, but I'm here to tell you, the donation of a kidney has saved my life, and you have given hope to millions. Your family member is a hero. He's a hero, not just to me, but to the entire world," Andrews said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll never be able to repay you, but I promise you it'll be in my heart. And it will be cared and loved for as long as I live, and I will spend my life basically preaching, and I'm not a preacher, about what this love did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Although treatments have improved in recent decades, it is not easy to know which ones will work best for which patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now researchers have designed a liquid biopsy that tells doctors how likely a patient is to respond to a specific treatment, even before it begins. The test has the potential to be gamechanging because it means patients could be offered alternative options, and avoid treatments that won’t help them, boosting their chances of beating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test, developed by a team at the Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research, London (ICR), analyses circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), which is released into the blood of patients by cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers measured these microscopic levels of cancer DNA in blood samples from 167 patients. The test was trialled before treatment began and again four weeks later, after a single treatment cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was a strong association between low levels of ctDNA at the start of treatment, and treatment response, according to the team. A similar association was seen with the results taken at four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Iseult Browne, a clinical research fellow at the ICR and first author of a study detailing the test, said: “Our study shows that a simple blood test measuring circulating tumour DNA can provide an early prediction of whether a patients’ breast cancer will respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Knowing this at the earliest stage – in this case, at the start of treatment, or after just four weeks – means that we can avoid giving patients drugs that won’t work and provide them with alternatives before their cancer has a chance to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For example, they could be given an alternative targeted therapy, a combination of drugs, or even enrolled into a clinical trial to test a novel drug. Trials are now under way to see if adapting a patient’s treatment based on these early blood tests does indeed improve their outcome – giving them more time of living well with their cancer kept at bay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the study, funded by Breast Cancer Now, Cancer Research UK, the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust and the ICR, the team analysed blood samples from 167 people with advanced breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patients were split into two groups based on the type of breast cancer and mutations they had. The first group included patients whose cancers had an ESR1, HER2, AKT1, AKT or PTEN mutation, and who received targeted treatments matched to those mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second group consisted of people with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease that constitutes 10-15% of cases globally and has no targetable mutation. They received a combination of the PARP inhibitor olarparib, and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For patients in the second group, low ctDNA levels before treatment began were associated with longer progression-free survival – 10.2 months, compared with 4.4 months. The percentage of patients who responded to treatment – seeing their tumours shrink or disappear – was 40% for those with low ctDNA levels, compared with 9.7% for those with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A similar, although weaker, association was observed between pre-treatment ctDNA levels and clinical outcomes in the first group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After just four weeks of treatment, patients in the first group with undetectable ctDNA went on to have particularly good outcomes. Their cancer was kept at bay for 10.6 months, compared with 3.5 months for those whose ctDNA was still detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the second group, the blood test after four weeks of treatment also showed a strong link between ctDNA levels and patient outcomes. Patients whose ctDNA was no longer detectable had their cancer kept at bay for 12 months, compared with 4.3 months in patients who still had detectable ctDNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By analysing circulating tumour DNA in blood samples from patients with advanced breast cancer, we identified a clear link between these levels, both at the start and after one cycle of treatment, and how well patients responded to therapy,” Browne said. “These findings support the use of ctDNA as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting outcomes and monitoring treatment response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Nicholas Turner, a professor of molecular oncology at the ICR and a consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, said: “This research looked at advanced breast cancer, but these tests could also work for early-stage breast cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The liquid biopsy “has the potential to make treatment decisions faster, more personalised and ultimately more effective,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPdzVXNmN3dzdIdExnV3QyZ0xVeElJVjR0N0hDSDNXSFFmY082NURKaDFIcTJnSUlHTklBcG81V1gzSzg2Zl9laDdRRXpMQm5FRVh5OEV5d1JXaGdKclhpaTlqbWxRTEFKZWRacGg2OE1wd0R4QkhaQUdEQTBmcE01RmkzVE9CX2s3TVIwcThPQjk0SXRheVV2d1RRNS1ObmJKNU1nenZxVEs4ZVdkMXkwOFdmc3lBM0VRRlFJLUZWMzhwU2ItNHVCNHFSbmFuODA</guid></item><item><title>你不仅有五种感官–新的研究表明，人类可能有多达33种感官- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/you-dont-have-just-five-senses-new-research-suggests-humans-may-have-up-to-33/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:31:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPeVZpSjRobDQ1eGJwWFlqWmFVeHlvZEcySjNQWElFbi1Hc1dzc0tUV18teXR2a0h2aEtNVmRYSUNaSE9JYXhwRmlRa3JJRm4zcHFTRmw4X2dHZUlEaXUtVDBuSGg3Y1BXYUhYcnhHblBsQk4xS0ZFSlpiX0hzX3A3WTN1R29OX3NTcS15NzRESjRuUE9TMjlQeG55bVVQNlcxbWd6SDZR</guid></item><item><title>我研究了200多名儿童-这是真正教导儿童情商的头号“神奇短语” - CNBC</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/18/child-psychologist-the-no-1-magic-phrase-that-truly-teaches-kids-emotional-intelligence.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-articleBody--AEqcE" id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-styles-makeit-hidden--MFwCR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: "What's wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well-intentioned and it comes from care.

Without that foundation, even the most caring questions can feel overwhelming in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across my research, one sentence reliably helped children pause, reflect, and communicate more openly: "Tell me what feels hard right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This magic phrase works because it matches how children actually experience emotions in real life.

It reduces defensiveness before the conversation even begins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During meltdowns, after-school emotional releases, or moments of sudden irritability, children are already on edge.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A 35-year-old New York City man paid about $2,500 for a whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that came up healthy — but then suffered a massive stroke less than a year later that the expensive procedure flagged no sign of, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/13/prenuvo-lawsuit-full-body-scan/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Now the stroke victim, Sean Clifford, is &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JejAC0DPndWW/Bequek7Xw==&amp;amp;system=prod" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;suing&lt;/a&gt; the MRI company behind the scan, Prenuvo — which has &lt;a href="https://people.com/we-tried-it-the-full-body-scan-celebrities-love-7509820" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;been endorsed by celebrities&lt;/a&gt; ranging from Paris Hilton to Cindy Crawford — for missing in the scans that 6o percent of his &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mca-stroke" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;proximal right middle cerebral artery&lt;/a&gt;, a common site for strokes, had narrowed and showed “irregularity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Clifford, who suffered a stroke in the same area where the blockage was missed by Prenuvo, is now paralyzed on his left side and permanently disabled — throwing into high relief that these scans, which prey on people’s fears, aren’t exactly fool proof-despite extravagant claims that they can pick up anything from tumors to brain aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A judge approved for the lawsuit, which was filed in September 2024, to proceed last month, according to &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt;. A statement from Prenuvo to the newspaper stated that “we take any allegation seriously and are committed to addressing it through the appropriate legal process. Our focus remains on delivering safe, high quality, proactive care to the patients who place their trust in us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Full body scans are controversial in the medical field because some doctors think they pick up details that could be false alarms that send patients down a rabbithole of expensive and unnecessary testing, according to &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt; — or, as in Clifford’s case, the scans can miss glaring signs of danger. Most conventional doctors instead use MRIs to focus on one area of the body that’s giving patients trouble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Mirza Rahman, a physician and ex-president of the American College of Preventive Medicine, told &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt; that the problem with these scans is that they give people a “false sense of reassurance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Do the radiologists have sufficient time to carefully look at the bones, the vessels, the organs, and all the other information that is generated by such scans?” Rahman said. “That is a question that needs to be answered.”&lt;/p&gt;
