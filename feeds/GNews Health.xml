			&lt;p&gt;A build-up of sticky proteins in the brain is a key hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, thought to be closely linked to the disease's progression. Now scientists have found a new way to clear these harmful clumps in the brains of mice and the eyes of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This potentially promising  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; treatment involves an oral dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid already used as a medication for conditions including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made by a team from Kindai University and Japan's National Institute of Neuroscience, who focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the same results can be achieved in human brains, we may have another avenue for potentially tackling a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;key molecular symptom&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's – in a safe and easily applied way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;We May Now Know Why Alzheimer's Erases Memories of Our Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress amyloid-beta aggregation both in vitro and in vivo," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yoshitaka Nagai, from Kindai University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg" alt="Fly model diagram" class="wp-image-182892 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel-600x477.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Arginine reduced amyloid-beta clumping (in green) in fruit fly models. (Fujii et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurochem. Int.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers bred male mice with Alzheimer's-like aggregations of amyloid-beta, then added arginine to the animals' drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arginine significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;reduced the protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; in the animals' brains and alleviated some of the related toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given arginine also showed reduced behavioral abnormalities during tests and had less active neuroinflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the treatment may not be just scrubbing away the protein plaques; it could be reversing some of the harm being done to the brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments in fruit flies and test tubes added to the evidence that arginine could possibly clear out amyloid-beta clumps and stop them from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already knew that arginine can act as a kind of chemical chaperone, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa115"&gt;preventing the abnormal misfolding&lt;/a&gt; and clumping of proteins, like those seen in Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies also show arginine can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305318"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, which is key for treating brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves here, it's important to note that the researchers used a relatively high dose of arginine in their animal tests, and more work needs to be done to figure out a safe treatment dose for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while mouse and fruit fly models are often good substitutes for human diseases, there's no guarantee that these findings are going to carry over. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; has produced encouraging results, and clinical trials can now be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;remains some uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; that clearing away amyloid-beta plaques can actually work as a way of treating Alzheimer's. These clumps are definitely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;harmful to neurons&lt;/a&gt;, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-alzheimers-years-ahead-of-first-symptoms"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; whether they're helping to drive Alzheimer's to begin with, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;signs of other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxic-tiny-rna-molecules-identified-as-culprit-in-alzheimers-neuron-death"&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats though, it's another encouraging step forward in our understanding of how Alzheimer's works and how we might be able to tackle it – another promising treatment option to add &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;to an ever-growing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106082"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Taking a photo of a friend? You've probably got their face centered and focused. Driving down a highway? Eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for millions of adults with age-related macular degeneration, that crucial, central field of sight is blurred beyond recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/promising-new-treatments-amd"&gt;Current treatments&lt;/a&gt; can only slow its progression or augment vision, but the blur will usually continue to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of a treatment based on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; transplants has found the procedure may be able to safely reverse the cumulative damage to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-fruit-could-reduce-chances-of-eye-disease-macular-degeneration"&gt;hard-working macula&lt;/a&gt; – that part of the retina &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;responsible for all you see directly in front of you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time this particular stem cell treatment has been tested in humans, and as a phase 1/2a clinical trial, the main focus of the investigation was safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the treatment compared with existing therapies won't be known until at least the end of phase 3, but the preliminary results were positive enough that trials are proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier testing in the lab showed the transplant process was safe enough to proceed with in-human trials: the transplanted  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; retained their retinal identity, and no tumours or toxicity were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening 18 potentially eligible patients, the researchers enrolled six volunteers aged 71 to 86 who had been diagnosed with dry age-related macular degeneration (&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;the most common type, making up around 80 percent of all macular degeneration cases&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the participants had worse vision in general, with visual acuity scores ranging from 20/200 to 20/800 (which means they could only see the first, biggest letter on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"&gt;Snellen chart&lt;/a&gt;, at best). The other three had scores between 20/70 and 20/200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the less common and more rapid 'wet' macular degeneration, the 'dry' form of the condition is a gradual loss of vision caused by tiny deposits of fats and proteins destroying the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"&gt;retinal pigment epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; (RPEs) that support the eye's light-sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg" alt="diagram of macular degeneration" class="wp-image-183119 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram showing early stages of dry macular degeneration, caused by deposits of fats and proteins known as drusen beneath the RPE.

The cells were inserted under the retina of the superior temporal macula in the patients' most-impaired eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the trial showed the treatment is safe, with no sign of the immune problems or tumors that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-stem-cell-test-may-reduce-tumour-risk-14932"&gt;can sometimes arise&lt;/a&gt; in stem cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were related to the stem cells themselves, though there were a few of the typical complications seen in this kind of eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, each patient experienced an improvement in vision in the eye that received the transplant that was not apparent in the other, suggesting the stem cells were doing exactly what scientists had hoped they would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after the treatment, the three participants who had the worst vision were able to see an average of 21 more letters on an eye chart than they had at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving," &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/adult-stem-cells-show-therapeutic-promise-treating-vision-loss-macular-degeneration"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rajesh Rao, a physician-scientist and ophthalmologist at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is continuing to monitor patients who received higher doses (150,000 and 250,000 cells). If those doses are also deemed safe, it will help determine whether Rao and team can scale up human testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.08.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The three new cases are all unvaccinated Wasatch County high school students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department suspects that people inside the high school during its normal hours may have been exposed to the virus on Nov. 14, 17 and 18, and at a school play on Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A letter with notification and guidance was sent to Wasatch High School families to inform them of the situation," a press release issued by the health department reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonelle Fitzgerald, the health department's director, said a wastewater test taken on Nov. 6 showed the presence of the virus within the community, "and with cases existing in other parts of the state, we weren't surprised to see cases here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent rise in cases in Wasatch County comes as the state's total number of cases hits triple digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; data dashboard shows 102 measles infections across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's infections with 74 measles cases, followed by Utah County, with nine cases, and Wasatch County's eight infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four people have been diagnosed with measles over the last three weeks, the dashboard reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a major holiday marks a time for gatherings among family and loved ones, health officials warn that measles is highly contagious and spreads easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms, which typically appear within one to three weeks after exposure, can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts on the face and spreads downward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wasatch County Health Department said it advises anyone experiencing symptoms to call their health care provider immediately, especially those who are unvaccinated or who have been exposed to a known case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials encourage residents to get both doses of the MMR vaccine, as they say it is 97% effective in preventing the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Abraham, 71, has called COVID vaccines "&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1966237494627983445" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;." During a Sept. 2024 state legislative meeting, Abraham said he would support investigating the debunked link between &lt;a href="https://www.healthcarejournalbr.com/journal/november-december-2024" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The position has been vacant since &lt;a href="https://farmington.edu/about/news/umf-proudly-announces-dr-nirav-dinesh-shah-former-principal-deputy-director-of-the-u-s-cdc-as-the-2025-umf-commencement-speaker/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah&lt;/a&gt;, who served under the Biden administration, stepped down in February.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shah called Abraham's appointment "atrocious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Kennedy. The CDC's current acting director is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently worked as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because neither Kennedy nor O'Neill is a doctor or scientist, Abraham's medical degree is useful to help further their views, Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With the addition of Dr. Abraham, they now have a scientific gloss that they can put on their anti-vaccine theories," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He gives Secretary Kennedy some scientific and medical cover for their odious and unscientific beliefs," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Abraham was named Louisiana's first Surgeon General in 2024, under Republican Governor &lt;a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/page/meet-the-governor" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Landry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon after, Abraham moved to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/20/nx-s1-5223440/louisiana-ban-public-health-promoting-covid-flu-mpox-vaccines-landry-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;ban the promotion of COVID, flu and mpox vaccines&lt;/a&gt; by the state health department. He then &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-02-17/louisiana-medical-organizations-criticize-states-ban-on-vaccine-promotion" target="_blank"&gt;banned all vaccine promotion and events&lt;/a&gt; by the health department in February, hours after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, cases of whooping cough in Louisiana began to climb, eventually growing to &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/232491" target="_blank"&gt;387 cases&lt;/a&gt;, the worst outbreak of whooping cough in the state in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Early in the outbreak, two infants died from the disease. Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;2 months old&lt;/a&gt;, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the infant deaths, Abraham's health department &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;waited three months&lt;/a&gt; before issuing an official alert to physicians and warning the public in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham's record shows that when an emergency in public health materializes, his instinct is to sweep it under the rug," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the event of the next pandemic, "that could mean the difference between controlling a major outbreak versus letting it fester and explode," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The principal deputy director is the second in command at the CDC, said &lt;a href="https://www.ncicp.org/staff-member/anne-schuchat-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Schuchat&lt;/a&gt;, who worked there for 33 years, including as principal deputy director from 2015 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most appointees are CDC employees who've worked at the agency for many years, and have experience in crisis management and emergency response to public health threats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities can run from overseeing every aspect of CDC's work within the U.S., to coordinating emergency responses to outbreaks around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schuchat called Abraham's appointment "scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This appears to be one more step away from health and towards danger," Schuchat said. "We know that vaccinations are saving lives and protecting health and preventing outbreaks, and ideology should not outweigh the evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Louisiana legislature, Abraham supported bills to &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/politics/2025-04-23/bill-banning-fluoride-in-louisianas-public-water-systems-clears-senate-committee" target="_blank"&gt;ban fluoride in public water systems&lt;/a&gt;, and to expand access to &lt;a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2025/04/30/louisiana-surgeon-general-recommends-ivermectin-as-covid-for-his-patients-and-backs-deregulation/83362570007/" target="_blank"&gt;ivermectin to treat COVID&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/30/1089809588/ivermectin-covid-treatment-brazil-study" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that it is not effective against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. The fluoride bill failed, but the ivermectin bill passed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Picking Abraham for this position was an "irresponsible choice," said &lt;a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lawrence-o-gostin/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Gostin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham has little trust in science and he is likely to further erode the credibility of the CDC," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;HHS has not said when Abraham will start his new role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWNO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Progress in cutting the global toll of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains painfully slow, but a new blood test has sparked unusual levels of hope. Researchers say it could one day make routine screening far more effective by catching cancers earlier, when treatment has the best chance of saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri blood test, developed by US firm Grail, is the latest entrant to attract worldwide attention, after early trial results were described as "exciting" by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/grail-pathfinder-2-results-show-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-increased-cancer-detection-more-than-seven-fold-when-added-to-uspstf-a-and-b-recommended-screenings/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; claims the test, currently being trialled by the NHS, can detect signals from 50 cancers and correctly identify the disease in 62 per cent of people who receive a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;The 7 Warning Signs of Brain Cancer You Might Easily Miss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appears to be highly accurate at ruling cancer out, with a reported 99.6 percent success rate among those who were disease-free. At first glance, these headline figures appear to represent a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we reach for the champagne, it's worth looking more closely at what these numbers really mean. Early promise does not always translate into real-world performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg" alt="cancer cells illustration" class="wp-image-183094 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New cancer blood test aims to identify cancers of varying types. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGv7Q2bTYc/"&gt;ninjadesign/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pathfinder 2 trial, involving 23,161 people aged over 50 from the US and Canada with no prior cancer diagnosis, produced the figures now circulating widely. Of the 216 participants who tested positive, 133 were later found to have cancer, giving the "positive predictive value" (PPV) of 62 percent that has been &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo"&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/05/galleri-early-cancer-detection-blood-test/87009742007/"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/18/cancer-blood-test-seven-times-more-effective-than-current/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That metric answers a crucial question: "If I test positive, what's the chance I actually have cancer?" It also means, however, that 38 percent of positive results were false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specificity – how often a test avoids falsely diagnosing cancer – is equally important, given the anxiety and medical follow-up triggered by an incorrect result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the test performed well: 99.6 percent of people without cancer received a correct negative result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even this strong number has implications. If everyone aged over 50 in the UK were tested – more than 26 million people – the same rate would still generate over 100,000 false positives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been less widely discussed is sensitivity, the measure of how many true cancer cases the test actually detects. On this measure, the result was 40.4 percent, meaning the test missed around three in every five cancers that appeared over the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galleri test results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A chart showing how many cancer cases the Galleri test would correctly identify." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Galleri cancer test in numbers.

It also raises the risk that patients could be falsely reassured by a negative result, potentially delaying a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statisticians caution that the reported PPV, specificity, and sensitivity are estimates rather than fixed values, and each comes with uncertainty. They also note that tests often perform less well outside carefully controlled trials, meaning real-world accuracy could be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does this leave the Galleri test? It may well become a useful addition to future screening programmes, provided that negative results are not viewed as definitive by patients or doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the low sensitivity means many cancers would still be missed in its current form. The test is also expensive – US$949 (£723) in the US – and no evidence yet shows that widely using it reduces cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early data is encouraging, but perhaps the excitement deserves to be tempered. This technology may be a step forward, but it is not a solution on its own.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270438/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 308 who benefited from tirzepatide, 254 (82 percent) regained at least 25 percent of the weight they had lost on the drug by week 88. Further, 177 (57 percent) regained at least 50 percent, and 74 (24 percent) regained at least 75 percent. Generally, the more weight people regained, the more their cardiovascular and metabolic health improvements reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data gaps and potential off-ramps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were 54 participants of the 308 (17.5 percent) that didn’t regain a significant amount of weight (less than 25 percent.) This group saw some of their health metrics worsen on withdrawal of the drug, but not all— blood pressure increased a bit, but cholesterol didn’t go up significantly overall. About a dozen participants (4 percent of the 308) continued to lose weight after stopping the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers couldn’t figure out why these 54 participants fared so well; there were “no apparent differences” in demographic or clinical characteristics, they reported. It’s clear the topic requires further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, the study offers a gloomy outlook for patients hoping to avoid needing to take anti-obesity drugs for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oczypok and Anderson highlight that the study involved an abrupt withdrawal from the drug. In contrast, many patients may be interested in slowly weaning off the drugs, stepping down dosage levels over time. So far, data on this strategy and the protocols to pull it off have little data behind them. It also might not be an option for patients who abruptly lose access or insurance coverage of the drugs. Other strategies for weaning off the drugs could involve ramping up physical activity or calorie restriction in anticipation of dropping the drugs, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more data on potential GLP-1 off-ramps, the pair calls for more data on the effects of weight fluctuations from people going on and off the treatment. At least one study has found that the regained weight after intentional weight loss may end up being proportionally higher in fat mass, which could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Oczypok and Anderson say doctors should be cautious about talking with patients about these drugs and what the future could hold. “These results add to the body of evidence that clinicians and patients should approach starting [anti-obesity medications] as long-term therapies, just as they would medications for other chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

The National Institutes of Health established RECOVER to address COVID as a global health priority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers tracked participants from 3 to 15 months after their first COVID infection. Almost all participants (99.6%) were infected with the Omicron variant. The enrollment period spanned October 29, 2021, to June 27, 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, 10.3% of participants met the criteria for long COVID at three months, and 81% of them continued to report persistent or fluctuating symptoms more than a year later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings were published last week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14% of participants experienced worsening symptoms over time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eight symptom trajectories emerged. About 5% of the infected cohort had “persistent, high” symptom burden across the entire 15-month period, while 12% experienced “intermittently high” symptoms. Another 10% showed moderate symptoms that gradually improved, and 9% experienced low-level symptoms that largely resolved by month six. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, 14% followed worsening or delayed-worsening trajectories, including a group whose symptoms remained minimal until spiking at month 15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study compared infected participants with an uninfected cohort over the same period. While persistent and improving symptoms were less common among uninfected adults, some worsening patterns appeared in both groups, raising the possibility that not all symptom increases reflect long COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors note several study limitations, including reliance on symptom surveys collected every three months (which may not have captured more granular, day-to-day changes), and the inability to capture trajectories beyond 15 months. Still, the large sample size, representative population, detailed symptom questionnaire, standardized long-COVID index, and minimal loss to follow up provide a clearer picture of long COVID’s different trajectories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a Mass General Brigham (MGB) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/insights-into-long-covid-trajectories-in-adults"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, corresponding author Bruce Levy, MD, of the MGB Department of Medicine, said, “Our findings will help determine what resources are needed for clinical and public health support of individuals with long COVID and will also inform efforts to understand long COVID’s biological basis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWIN FALLS, Idaho — The South Central Public Health District in Idaho has reported a "steep increase" in HIV and HIV-3, commonly known as AIDS, in several Idaho counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Central Public &lt;a href="/article/news/local/maternity-desert-oregon-county-fights-to-restore-labor-and-delivery-care-with-federal-funding/277-9b41be07-e924-4276-93b8-49bf91643258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; District (SCPHD) oversees eight counties in Idaho, including Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Twin Falls. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those eight counties, new cases of HIV and HIV-3 in 2025 have "far outpaced total case numbers from 2024," a news release announced. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to numbers provided by SCPHD, there were five cases of HIV reported last year. However, in 2025, there were 15 cases reported. For HIV-3 cases, or AIDS cases, there was only one reported case in 2024. There have been nine reported cases this year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCPHD is now urging residents of these counties, and all Idahoans, to practice vigilance. SCPHD asks that residents reduce their risk of contracting HIV by using condoms and obtaining up-to-date HIV and STI testing following sexual acts with a new partner. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HIV is now a manageable condition with proper treatment; however, cases that are undiagnosed or go untreated remain a serious concern," SCPHD Epidemiologist Jacob Ward said in a news release. "When HIV is not treated, it can progress to AIDS. This severely weakens the immune system and increases the risk of life-threatening infections and illnesses. Early testing and consistent treatment are so important to protecting long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World AIDS Day is set to be held on Monday, Dec. 1. To honor the day, SCPHD will be offering free HIV screenings all day on selected dates at its Twin Falls and Jerome locations. SCPHD is doing so to support community health and early detection, a news release said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk-in testing at the SCPHD Twin Falls office is scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 4. At the Jerome office, walk-in testing is available on Tuesday, Dec. 9, between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valerie's yummy 4-ingredient anti-inflammatory dessert is chia pudding. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She uses a flavored protein shake as her liquid, plus blackberries and gut-healthy yogurt on top. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds have omega-3 fatty acids that may help lower inflammation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there's anyone we trust to give us a classic recipe that they've been enjoying for years, it's Valerie Bertinelli. We loved her &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8057560/valerie-bertinelli-anti-inflammatory-snack-for-years/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;favorite old-fashioned snack&lt;/a&gt;, and now the actor and &lt;em&gt;Food Network&lt;/em&gt; host has another simple recipe to share.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bertinelli shared an easy dessert that only takes four ingredients to make. It's customizable, tasty and may even help reduce inflammation. Here's what she had to say about her go-to cold dessert.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-making-valeries-chia-pudding"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Making Valerie's Chia Pudding &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I made chia pudding for my treat for the day," Bertinelli said. "And it's really easy: you take 2 tablespoons of chia seeds and a half a cup of liquid."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; have plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein. They can help reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol and can help promote weight loss, if that is your goal. Chia pudding is a great way to incorporate the healthy seeds into your diet in a delicious way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the liquid that Bertinelli added was Core Power's Strawberry Banana High-Protein Shake. We named Core Power as one of our favorite protein shakes on the market in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964007/best-protein-shakes-protein-powders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EatingWell's&lt;/em&gt; protein shake taste test&lt;/a&gt;, so we definitely approve of this option!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I stirred it up, put it in the fridge, let it sit for about four hours," Bertinelli explained. "Overnight's better, but I forgot to make it last night. And then I put a little bit of vanilla yogurt on top and some fresh blackberries."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-valerie-fights-inflammation-with-dessert"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Valerie Fights Inflammation with Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Topping off the pudding with blackberries and yogurt adds an extra &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory punch&lt;/a&gt; to this recipe. Adding these foods into your eating pattern can contribute to reducing inflammation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;combat symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like joint stiffness, mental fog and digestive issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That's all it takes! Just four ingredients for a fruity and satisfying bite. Bertinelli's recipe is very similar to our own &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding formula&lt;/a&gt; that we absolutely swear by. It's completely customizable and so easy to make ahead of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's so nutritious that you could actually eat it for breakfast and be fueled to take on the rest of the morning. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258640/chai-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chai Chia Pudding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8034698/berry-orange-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Berry-Orange Chia Pudding&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for adding to your morning routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; P.S. to Valerie: Since you mentioned that you're looking for low-sugar yogurt recommendations in your video, check out these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7904866/best-plant-based-yogurts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;editor-loved plant-based yogurts&lt;/a&gt; that have no more than 4 grams of added sugar per serving.

As second in command, Abraham would be in a position to act as a key adviser on a variety of public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8e988" class="body-graf"&gt;A three-term Louisiana congressman, Abraham practiced for 10 years as a veterinarian before going to medical school. According to his &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/docs/Secretary/OfficialDocs/Official-Bio_Ralph-Abraham.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the Louisiana Department of Health website&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham was a “practicing family medicine physician” when he was appointed as state surgeon general in 2024. He described himself as a “&lt;a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/la/health-care/ralph-abraham-maha-robert-kennedy-jeff-landry" target="_blank"&gt;country doctor&lt;/a&gt;” in an essay published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82eac5" class="body-graf"&gt;While Abraham is licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana, the &lt;a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/02/18/abraham-board/" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Illustrator reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that he did not appear to be board-certified in the specialty of family medicine. A search for Abraham on the &lt;a href="https://portfolio.theabfm.org/diplomate/find.aspx?ts=638996677" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Family Medicine’s website&lt;/a&gt; yielded no results. A separate search on the &lt;a href="https://online.lasbme.org/#/verifylicense" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiner’s site&lt;/a&gt; lists Abraham as a general practitioner but not a family medicine doctor. (Board certification isn’t required to practice any particular specialty, but it’s viewed as an extra layer to ensure a doctor’s credentials, experience and expertise, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.abpsus.org/physician-board-certified-specialties/" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Physician Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-597546" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s new position makes him the most senior scientist at CDC. The current acting director, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O’Neill, is not a medical doctor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c2a62" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Richard Besser, who served as an acting director of the CDC in 2009 under the Obama administration, said he is “greatly concerned” that Abraham’s appointment will serve as an extension of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s well-established distrust of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-12c622" class="body-graf"&gt;“Dr. Abraham, rather than being someone who will push back on that, I think, will further the Secretary’s agenda,” said Besser, a pediatrician and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said. “I would expect that Dr. Abraham will have a lot of authority over what takes place within the agency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8e3d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham has been vocal in his opposition of Covid vaccines. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/louisiana-surgeon-general-says-covid-160350442.html" target="_blank"&gt;he told the Shreveport Times&lt;/a&gt; that he “sees Covid vaccine injuries every day.” There was no explanation of the kind of injuries he was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e105c" class="body-graf"&gt;In February, The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-vaccination-surgeon-general-8e2eecde047648e6fb62c4b44edd6566" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press reported&lt;/a&gt; that Abraham directed the Louisiana Department of Health, in an internal memo, to “no longer promote mass vaccination” through media campaigns like those for flu shots typically seen at the beginning of the winter respiratory virus season. The AP obtained the memo signed by Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a54cd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3f3c" class="body-graf"&gt;While flu activity is low so far this season, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-46.html" target="_blank"&gt; CDC’s latest flu report&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana is reporting the highest levels of flu-like illnesses in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c076ad" class="body-graf"&gt;In the past year, with Abraham at the helm, the state’s Department of Health waited several months after two babies died of whooping cough before&lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; formally alerting the public&lt;/a&gt; about a rise in cases across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1def2b" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1990813242055114835" target="_blank"&gt;On X&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;touted a drug called leucovorin&lt;/a&gt; as a promising treatment for some children with autism.

It's a common concern, so we consulted an expert to find out how you can enjoy your favorite drinks while keeping your pearly whites nice and bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;According to Dr. Anjali Rajpal, a board-certified dentist at &lt;a data-id="21ff9cfb-d62d-42d2-a2e2-f0acc1ba011e" href="https://bhdentalarts.com/" target="_self"&gt;Beverly Hills Dental Arts&lt;/a&gt;, there are different techniques you can use to prevent teeth staining while still getting to enjoy your favorite beverage. Plus, if your teeth have already been stained, Rajpal offers advice on how to brighten your pearly whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e73c270c-bc57-4195-b0c6-3678087461b1" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Why do coffee and wine stain your teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is a combination of chromogens (a substance that can be colorless but can be converted into a colored compound, often through a chemical reaction), tannins and acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coffee and red wine stain teeth because they contain dark pigments called chromogens that stick to enamel. Tannins in these drinks help the pigments bind more strongly to the teeth. Their acidity also weakens enamel, making it easier for stains to set in," Rajpal told CNET. She explains that darker roasts and concentrated coffees, such as espresso, tend to stain teeth more than lighter brews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, red wine stains more than white, especially darker, tannin-rich varieties like cabernet sauvignon and malbec.

The temperature of a drink can influence how much it can stain your teeth. Hot beverages are more likely to cause stains than iced ones. "Heat can slightly expand enamel, making it more porous and allowing pigments to penetrate more easily," Rajpal said. "While iced drinks may have less impact due to quicker consumption and lower enamel exposure, the type and frequency of the drink matter more overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain types of coffee can stain your teeth more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Boy_Anupong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9a262815-f7ba-4301-bedc-74aac512a505" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Expert dental tips to keep your teeth white without giving up your favorite drinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting your teeth from stains doesn't mean you have to give up your morning cup of Joe.

Drink your coffee or wine in one sitting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst things you can do is sip your coffee or wine slowly for hours. "Sipping slowly throughout the day constantly exposes your enamel to staining compounds and gives your teeth less time to recover, making stains more likely to build up over time," Rajpal says. Try to enjoy your drink over a 15- to 30-minute period, then rinse with water after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="2ebdcf23-1095-4ec0-b2f8-cc6bf37bb025" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Rinse, don't brush, right after&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this one seems counterintuitive, but brushing your teeth right after you have coffee or wine can actually do more harm. "Avoid brushing immediately after drinking, as acids can soften enamel and make it more vulnerable," Rajpal recommends. "Wait at least 30 minutes before brushing to protect softened enamel, and give a break between snacking or eating to boost natural cleansing by saliva."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="8a374af1-4de1-4ce9-9443-d8642596648e" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4.

Led by University College London and the University of Oxford, this groundbreaking trial marks a major step in cancer prevention. Unlike conventional treatments, which target cancer after it develops, the vaccine aims to train the immune system to recognise early abnormal lung cells and eliminate them before they form tumours. By intervening at the earliest stages, researchers hope LungVax could significantly reduce the incidence of lung cancer and improve survival rates. This historic trial has the potential to transform approaches to one of the world’s deadliest cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding early lung cancer and the LungVax phase I trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with survival rates stubbornly low despite decades of research. In the UK alone, around 48,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and approximately 72% of these cases are linked to smoking, the largest preventable cause of cancer globally. Researchers have now pinpointed the biological mechanisms behind the early formation of lung cancer in smokers, identifying abnormal proteins called neoantigens and tumour-associated antigens that appear on the surface of lung cells at the earliest stages of cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these early cellular changes, scientists are now able to develop vaccines that teach the immune system to recognise and attack abnormal cells before they progress into malignant tumours. The LungVax clinical trial has been awarded up to £2.06 million in funding from Cancer Research UK, with additional support from the CRIS Cancer Foundation. This funding will support a four-year Phase I trial, designed to establish both the safety and the optimal dosing of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase I trials are primarily concerned with safety, side effects, and identifying the appropriate dosage. In this trial, researchers will carefully monitor how participants respond to LungVax, documenting any adverse effects and observing the immune system’s response to the vaccine. Subject to regulatory approvals, the trial is expected to begin in summer 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How LungVax works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional cancer therapies, which often target tumours after they have developed, LungVax is a preventative vaccine. Lung cancer cells differ from healthy cells in that they display unique ‘red flag’ proteins on their surface, produced by mutations in the cell’s DNA. These proteins are called neoantigens and tumour-associated antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LungVax vaccine contains genetic instructions that teach the immune system to recognise these abnormal proteins. Once trained, the immune system can identify and destroy early-stage cancer cells before they form full tumours. The vaccine builds on mRNA technology first refined during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling safe and effective delivery of these instructions to the body’s immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sarah Blagden, co-founder of LungVax from the University of Oxford, explains that this is a unique opportunity to actively prevent lung cancer. “Years of research into the biology of cancer, understanding the earliest cellular changes, will now be put to the test. Our hope is that LungVax will allow people to receive preventative protection against this lethal disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Target groups for the initial trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase I trial will initially focus on two groups of participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer who have had the tumour surgically removed but remain at risk of recurrence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People undergoing routine lung cancer screening under the NHS Lung Cancer Screening Programme in England, who may be at high risk of developing the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the trial demonstrates safety and promising immune responses, the vaccine could progress to larger clinical trials, ultimately reaching a wider population at risk of lung cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While smoking cessation remains the most effective strategy to reduce lung cancer risk, vaccines like LungVax offer a complementary approach. By targeting cancer at its earliest stage, these interventions could significantly improve survival rates and reduce the burden of lung cancer worldwide. With the launch of this historic trial, the medical community is taking its first step towards a future in which lung cancer prevention is not just a possibility but a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>大脑中的细菌碎片会影响您的睡眠吗？这就是《科学》。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/could-pieces-of-bacteria-in-your-brain-affect-your-sleep-heres-the-science</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the essential physiological needs for human survival, alongside food, water, and air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sleep is socially driven, influenced by environmental and personal factors, and a recent study suggests it may be affected by fragments from bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, scientists have thought it unlikely that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/gut-microbes-23988"&gt;gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; affect physiological sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1608302/full"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, indicated bacterial cell wall components (peptidoglycan) have been found in areas of the brain called the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptidoglycan, also known as murein in scientific lore, is a strong, mesh-like layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacterial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps contain the bacteria's shape and rigidity. Without peptidoglycan, bacteria would just be little water balloons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182944" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642.jpg" alt="bacterial cells" class="wp-image-182944 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182944" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bacterial walls are rigid, made of a material called peptidoglycan. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG04vPHQko/"&gt;TrueCreatives/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent study suggested that the concentration of peptidoglycan seems to increase in periods of sleep deprivation or changes in sleeping patterns. This is a sign that the gut microbiota might play a role in sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was carried out on nine male mice which were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Measurements were taken over 48 hours to map brain activity cycles during sleep and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards the mice were euthanised. Different areas of the brain were separated immediately so isolated areas could be measured independently for peptidoglycan levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been conducted and designed in a rigorous fashion. But the study exclusively used adult male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although animal models can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4283646/"&gt;translated to humans&lt;/a&gt;, the crossover in microbiota research is weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal research into microbiota can only tell us so much about what is happening in our guts because the environment in which humans and mice live is vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17183312/"&gt;breakthrough paper in 2006&lt;/a&gt; raised mice without any microorganisms in their bodies, known as germ-free mice, and then transplanted some of them with the gut microbiota from obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found the mice who had the gut microbiota transplant gained more body fat than germ-free mice colonised with microbiota from lean mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough research suggested that the gut microbiota might contribute to weight gain and a knock-on effect obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But follow-up studies using &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774355#247496527"&gt;fecal microbiota transplantation&lt;/a&gt; from lean humans into obese adolescents did not lead to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings in mice can suggest mechanisms but not necessarily predict outcomes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the recent sleep research on mice has ignored the other 49% of the population, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10731147/"&gt;females&lt;/a&gt;. It's a gap that risks leaving half the world in the dark about sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to understanding the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;, does it really matter what organisms are found in the gastrointestinal tract of rodents and how this might interfere with their sleep patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-over-400000-people-links-gut-bacteria-with-insomnia-risk"&gt;Study of Over 400,000 People Links Gut Bacteria With Insomnia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brain is traditionally considered sterile and protected by the blood-brain barrier. This tight system blocks microbes and molecules from entering the brain in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence to suggest that there is a brain microbiome, unlike within the digestive system and on our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, previous studies have shown &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/8/4235"&gt;fragments&lt;/a&gt; that relate to bacteria, such as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides, can be detected within the brain. This is probably because the fragments are smaller than bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier and intestinal wall are more permeable in conditions like sleep deprivation, inflammation, ageing or even after strenuous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642.jpg" alt="brain model" class="wp-image-182950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood vessels in the brain are surrounded by a barrier that prevents microbes from entering.

But because of the narrow eligibility criteria based on smoking history, millions at risk never get screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Northwestern Medicine researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults within an age range could help close those gaps, especially for groups often underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults could help catch the missing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was conducted at a single academic center, which means the patient population may not represent the wider U.S. population.

            National Geographic fellow and best-selling author Dan Buettner knows this as well as anyone, and he has tips you can use — even for holiday feasts﻿. For two decades, he has been studying “blue zones,” places around the globe where people live the longest and healthiest lives. Diet is one of the major reasons why these folks have an edge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000k3b6ndfkbk13z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/longevity-blue-zone-meals-wellness"&gt;People in blue zones&lt;/a&gt;, including Okinawa, Japan, and the island of Sardinia in Italy, eat plant-based diets that prioritize whole foods. “These simple peasant foods taste maniacally delicious,” Buettner told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. “That’s the word I like to use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000l3b6nxca2vat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner’s latest cookbook, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Kitchen-One-Meals/dp/1426224125/" target="_blank"&gt;The Blue Zones Kitchen One Pot Meals&lt;/a&gt;: 100 Recipes to Live to 100,” puts a spin on the healthy ingredients people use in these far-flung places so that they&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;appeal to the American palate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000m3b6nlvxol83p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner collaborated with &lt;a href="https://jeichstaedt.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Eichstaedt&lt;/a&gt;, who directs Stanford University’s Computational Psychology and Well-Being Lab, using artificial intelligence to analyze 675,000 recipes from popular websites including Food Network and Allrecipes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We found that most of the most popular recipes in America followed one of seven different patterns,” Buettner explained. “And then we kind of reverse engineered deliciousness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000o3b6np4fm3ak3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the recipes have other virtues to overcome common concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000p3b6npx22i4bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have the competition from fast food and processed food, one of the biggest objections you’re going to get is, ‘I don’t have time. No. 2, ‘I can’t afford it.’ No. 3, ‘I don’t know how to do it.’ No. 4, ‘I don’t think it’ll be delicious,’” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To develop a cookbook of one-pot recipes, Buettner said, “I started with these criteria: that every recipe had to take less than 20 minutes to combine, it had to cost less than three bucks a serving, and it had to be maniacally delicious.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieoqati000y3b6n4bt9rvgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thanksgiving apparently did not get the longevity-promoting memo, since many of the dishes Americans typically love to devour during the feast are a few sticks of butter in excess of being health-promoting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00133b6n5u4pbucv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that doesn’t mean you have to toss the turkey out with the gravy. Small tweaks can help you align your holiday meal with blue-zone eating patterns. Here are Buettner’s five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00143b6npl29y98k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2022/11/the-true-first-thanksgiving/" target="_blank"&gt;original Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; staples — beans, corn and squash — are also three of the most longevity-boosting foods on the planet, Buettner said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00153b6n7a1iputd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He noted that versions of this nutrient-packed trio are not just part of traditional Native American diets, but also those of people living in the blue zones  of Costa Rica’s Nicoya region and the island of Icaria in Greece.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00163b6n4s51f03h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Build your menu around these, and you’re already eating like centenarians.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001e3b6ntfu7s341@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Add a longevity-boosting salad or vegetable-forward side dish (or two) to the feast, Buettner suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001f3b6nba7z93x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Blue-zone tables are full of leafy greens: mustard greens, collards, wild arugula, fennel fronds,” he said. “A simple, herb-heavy salad or roasted seasonal vegetables can lighten a traditionally heavy meal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001g3b6nodx7ojil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s a side dish recipe from “One Pot Meals” to try:

            &lt;strong&gt;For the glaze&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;For the carrots&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            12 ounces carrots, peeled (about 5 medium carrots)
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            ¼ teaspoon cumin seed
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

            ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika (hot or sweet, according to taste)
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.8.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            ¼ cup carrot greens or fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            In a ramekin or small bowl, whisk together the glaze ingredients until the honey is dissolved, then set aside.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Cut the carrots lengthwise in half or quarters so that the widest ends are about ¼ inch thick.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Toss the carrots in the oil to coat evenly, then add the salt and spices and toss again.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Spread the carrots in a single layer on a13-x-9-inch sheet pan, with curved sides facing up.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Roast the carrots for 30 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Drizzle the glaze over the carrots, and return to the oven for 5 more minutes.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.6.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Garnish with the chopped greens before serving.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            In accompaniments calling for refined grains, swap in whole-grain alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001n3b6n6nb2zvu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Instead of white rolls or refined stuffing, try whole-grain sourdough, barley or wild rice,” Buettner said. “These keep blood sugar stable and keep you fuller with fewer calories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001o3b6nugbks8mu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if you go with your favorites, you can tweak them to be healthier, as Buettner does in his take on whipped potatoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Trim any dark spots off the potatoes, then halve or quarter the potatoes so all the pieces are roughly the same size, about 2 inches across.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Bring the water to a boil and cook until a knife can pierce the potatoes with minimal resistance, about 20 minutes.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Add the oil, salt and chives and use an immersion blender to whip it all into a smooth, velvety puree.
        &lt;/span&gt;

            Instead of piling up your plate with every dessert on offer, try to reframe the way you think about the course.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “You don’t need to ban dessert, just change the equation,” Buettner said. “In Sardinia, people enjoy a single simple sweet after meals, not an avalanche of pies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Another option: Try naturally sweet foods like baked apples, roasted squash or dates, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Strengthen ties with family and friends
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Make the holiday social, active and purposeful. “A blue-zone Thanksgiving doesn’t end at the table,” Buettner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002h3b6n1of245hu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nor does it start there. “Play a game, ask everyone to share a gratitude story or include elders in the cooking,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002i3b6nl7tf2s8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, post-meal, head outside for a stroll, not to the couch — at least not right away!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002j3b6nqukqy1ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Longevity isn’t just about what’s on the plate,” he said. “It’s the whole web of connection around it.”

Maybe you’re mentally wiped after socializing all day, or your brain is fried from hours of work. If you got up early, it could simply be that you’d rather crawl under a blanket and watch Netflix than interact with other people—all of these are legitimate reasons to feel cranky during this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But in people with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dementia" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;—which is an umbrella term for mental decline and can be related to a number of diseases such as Alzheimer's—there’s a phenomenon known as “sundowning,” where symptoms (such as being agitated or anxious) ramp up later in the day and evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As you head into the holiday season, you’re likely spending more time than usual with older loved ones. With that, it’s worth it for any adult to better understand how sundowning presents, and what it might mean for the cognitive health of your loved one. We tapped two health care providers who treat older adults for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-mtq1aa emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shannel Kassis Elhelou" data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Shannel Kassis Elhelou&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, is a geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" target="_blank" title="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fred Kobylarz" data-node-id="4.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fred Kobylarz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is co-director of the Center for Healthy Aging at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="sundowning-is-a-term-that-refers-to-behavior-changes-in-people-with-dementia-that-occur-at-a-particular-time-of-day" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;‘Sundowning’ is a term that refers to behavior changes in people with dementia that occur at a particular time of day.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Also known as “sundowner’s syndrome,” sundowning is a set of symptoms or behaviors that can be seen in some people with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s Association" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“This usually happens as the dementia progresses,” says &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" target="_blank" title="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fred Kobylarz" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fred Kobylarz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, co-director of the Center for Healthy Aging at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “It is not a disease, but a symptom of dementia.” Unfortunately, doctors “don’t really know the cause of this,” he adds. It's possible that sundowning in dementia patients is caused by a combination of hormonal changes, brain deterioration or damage that has occurred, environmental factors, disruption to a person's circadian rhythm, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="8" class="body-h4 css-ijdjx3 emevuu60"&gt;Symptoms of sundowning can vary by person, but they &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="can include" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;can include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="9" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.0"&gt;     Anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.1"&gt;     Agitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.2"&gt;     Pacing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.3"&gt;     Disorientation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.4"&gt;     Hallucinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.5"&gt;     Trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning “typically occurs in the late afternoon and evening in individuals diagnosed with dementia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shannel Kassis Elhelou" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Shannel Kassis Elhelou&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, a geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. However, Dr. Kobylarz notes it can start as early as 1 p.m. for some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-sundowning-looks-like" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What Sundowning Looks Like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s a difference between being totally over your day and sundowning. In addition to the symptoms listed above, sundowning can include verbal or even physical outbursts, Elhelou says. That may mean lashing out when dinner isn’t what they thought it would be or getting frustrated when they can’t find something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Some people may even want to be physically closer than usual to loved ones, following them closely “for reassurance,” Elhelou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;For others, sundowning can show up as confusion. “They will not remember conversations from earlier in the day or what they ate,” Dr. Kobylarz says. That can including wanting to eat dinner again right after finishing a meal they don't remember. People also may not remember where their home is or the loved ones who take care of them, Dr. Kobylarz  says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“You can see [the person with dementia] change at a certain time of the day and almost become another person,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-sundowning-be-a--sign-of-early-dementia" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Can Sundowning Be A Sign Of Early Dementia? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning is often a symptom that happens &lt;em data-node-id="17.1"&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; someone is diagnosed with dementia or a dementia-related disease, but it can also be an early sign of mental decline itself. “There are changes taking place in the brain,” Dr. Kobylarz explains, that lead to the onset of dementia and continue as it progresses. So, it is possible for someone to exhibit sundowning behaviors who has not yet been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="18" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“While sundowning is more common in dementia, it is not exclusive to it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Elhelou stresses that if you notice a loved one showing signs of sundowning, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee that they have dementia. “While sundowning is more common in dementia, it is not exclusive to it,” she notes. “Similar symptoms can occasionally be seen in older adults &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; dementia, particularly when they are ill or experiencing delirium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-distinguish-sundowning-from-typical-aging" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;How To Distinguish Sundowning From Typical Aging &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, it’s completely normal to feel like you’re not the best version of yourself when it’s later in the day, especially for older adults. That goes double over the holidays, when everyone is stressed and overstimulated. But sundowning has some unique signs that make it stand out from just being tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fatigue can occur at all times of the day.  Sundowning is truly confusion,” Dr. Kobylarz says. “If you have fatigue, you can take a catnap and feel refreshed. With sundowning, they are not usually fatigued, and they are ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning also tends to happen consistently around the same time of day, Elhelou says. “It often includes cognitive effects such as significant disorientation or impaired judgement,” she says. If someone is experiencing actual sundowning, they’re also likely to still display symptoms even after they rest, Elhelou points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-help-a-loved-one-manage-sundowning" data-node-id="25" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;How To Help A Loved One Manage Sundowning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Managing sundowning means trying to figure out your loved one’s new rhythm. “Managing sundowning should include a regular routine with scheduling and caregiving—essentially knowing their best time of day,” Dr. Kobylarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While Elhelou says it can be “challenging” to manage sundowning, she recommends creating a calm environment and routine as best you can. “Start by maintaining a consistent daily routine to reduce confusion and fatigue,” she says. “Encourage activities and exposure to natural light during the day to support healthy sleep-wake cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It's also crucial to try to avoid overstimulation in the evenings by limiting loud noises, bright screens, or large gatherings. “Address physical needs, such as hunger, thirst, or discomfort to ensure they feel secure,” Elhelou says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, showing symptoms of sundowning doesn’t automatically mean that your loved one has dementia—but it is something to get checked out. “As soon as you suspect sundowning changes in your loved one, bring this this up with [their] doctor,” Dr. Kobylarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The doctor can look for potential underlying causes, including dementia, medication effects, or environmental factors, Elhelou says. From there, they can suggest effective ways to help you manage the behavioral changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge have suggested he may have slightly overestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When it comes to the brain, research suggests there are actually five distinct ages — including an adolescent phase that extends into your thirties and a period of stable high performance that ends in your mid-sixties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research, said: “We know the brain’s wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why. This study is the first to identify major phases of &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/get-britain-reading/article/how-bedtime-stories-synchronise-your-childs-brain-with-yours-vc3b2mfp8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;brain wiring&lt;/a&gt; across a&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; human lifespan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Her team analysed MRI scans from more than 3,800 people, ranging from infants to individuals in their nineties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The results, published in Nature Communications, revealed four pivotal turning points — around the ages of 9, 32, 66 and 83 — that divide a human life into five “epochs” of brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During the first, from birth to about the age of nine, the connections between separate areas of the brain become less efficient. It takes more effort to send information between distant regions. If the brain were a city, its roads would be more convoluted, taking longer to travel from one neighbourhood to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/brain-fog-after-poor-sleep-uncovered-research-0j2wzj0zd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brain fog in the morning? Scientists now know why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, within each neighbourhood, the brain is getting better at specialised tasks. Clusters of neurones start building stronger, tighter bonds — a process known as local segregation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The first significant shift, at the age of nine, coincides with a surge in cognitive skills but also rising vulnerability to mental health disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The connections linking separate regions start to work more effectively. Communication between disparate brain areas becomes much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This period, which lasts until 32, has been described by the researchers as a surprisingly lengthy adolescent phase. It builds to a moment of peak performance, most commonly in a person’s early thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Next comes a plateau, stretching from about 32 to 66, during which measures of intelligence and personality traits tend to remain stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/human-mind-peak-age-fb58z2mr2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forget youthful brilliance — the human mind actually peaks at 60&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The next structural shift, at about the age of 66 is marked by the start of a subtle deterioration in the brain’s white matter — the network of fibre-like cables that allow different regions to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The final turning point, at 83, ushers in a phase where different brain neighbourhoods become more isolated. Direct connections between regions break down. There’s an increased reliance on local networks — a neurological echo, perhaps, of Shakespeare’s “second childishness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Duncan Astle, a professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge, who is senior author of the study, said: “Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Many neuro-developmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory and a whole host of different behaviours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:47:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPd1g3Y1NOVVRQZjFGWjhVbzZSSi1DeWZJLUMyZVJMUXF2YVlNdl9iV01mSXNkUThxWFlzY0J5OWNJVHVNOU1jNFFIb3FCYURkVlRNcUxlWC1fTXdJQXN6VkVDVGFwb0E1R2tHWjlyWGdKZXJTRFVCOWRkaTNoR182UHFoVy1jMzBFSE84UzhmVmJ1YWVYU2c</guid></item><item><title>由于对疫苗有效性的担忧，新型流感病毒入侵西宾夕法尼亚州- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/regional/new-strain-of-flu-invades-western-pa-amid-concerns-over-vaccine-efficacy/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

Even after accounting for factors like age, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions, those who did not use CPAP were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s as those who treated their apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how repeated nighttime drops in oxygen may heighten long-term vulnerability of the brain’s neural circuits. Researchers say the results underscore the importance of sleep-quality interventions as a potential buffer against neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Untreated sleep apnea nearly doubled long-term Parkinson’s risk compared to treated apnea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective CPAP:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular CPAP use significantly reduced the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic oxygen disruption during sleep may predispose neurons to degeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals that people with untreated obstructive sleep apnea have a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. However, they can significantly reduce the risk by improving the quality of their sleep by using continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, examined electronic health records covering more than 11 million U.S. military veterans who received care through the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1999 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and the Portland VA Health Care System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative condition that affects an estimated 1 million people nationwide, with the risk rising incrementally year by year for people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study suggests a heightened risk of people with untreated sleep apnea developing Parkinson’s over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting to rule out confounding factors like obesity, age and high blood pressure, the study found a strong link between untreated sleep apnea and Parkinson’s. Among millions of people with sleep apnea, those who didn’t treat the condition with CPAP were nearly twice as likely to have Parkinson’s as those who did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not at all a guarantee that you’re going to get Parkinson’s, but it significantly increases the chances,” said co-author Gregory Scott, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of pathology in the OHSU School of Medicine and a pathologist for at the VA Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea is a common condition where an individual’s breathing stops and restarts many times during sleep, which can prevent the body from getting enough oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you stop breathing and oxygen is not at a normal level, your neurons are probably not functioning at a normal level either,” said lead author Lee Neilson, M.D., assistant professor of neurology at OHSU and a staff neurologist at the Portland VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Add that up night after night, year after year, and it may explain why fixing the problem by using CPAP may build in some resilience against neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neilson said he intends to prioritize the health benefits of sound sleep with his patients, especially in view of the research revealing an elevated risk of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it will change my practice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott noted that even though some people with sleep apnea resist treatment with CPAP, he pointed to the experience of many veterans who swear by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The veterans who use their CPAP love it,” he said. “They’re telling other people about it. They feel better, they’re less tired. Perhaps if others know about this reduction in risk of Parkinson’s disease, it will further convince peopel with sleep apnea to give CPAP a try.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Scott and Neilson, co-authors include Isabella Montano, B.A., Jasmin May, M.D., Ph.D., Jonathan Elliott, Ph.D., and Miranda Lim, M.D., Ph.D., of OHSU and the Portland VA Health Care System; and Yeilim Cho, M.D., and Jeffrey Iliff, Ph.D., of the University of Washington and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the VA, grant awards BX005760, CX00253, I01RX004822, I01RX005371, CX002022, BX006155 and Bx006155; the John and Tami Marick Family Foundation, the Collins Medical Trust; the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, award P30AG066518; and the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5014, under award numbers HT9425-24-1-0774 and HT9425-24-1-0775.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinions, interpretations, conclusions and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the Department of Defense, the NIH, VA or other funders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027334040"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does untreated sleep apnea raise the risk of Parkinson’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes, people with untreated sleep apnea were nearly twice as likely to develop Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027336097"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can CPAP therapy lower this Parkinson’s risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes, consistent CPAP use significantly reduced Parkinson’s risk in long-term data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027335896"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why might sleep apnea contribute to neurodegeneration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Chronic oxygen disruption may harm neurons over years, increasing vulnerability to disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep apnea and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c0e131e1512190e153c13140f0952191809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erik Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ohsu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Erik Robinson – Oregon Health and Science University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.4691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Positive Airway Pressure, and Implications of Early Treatment in Parkinson Disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregory Scott et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Positive Airway Pressure, and Implications of Early Treatment in Parkinson Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with many health conditions, including dementia and early mortality. Prior epidemiological studies linking OSA with Parkinson disease (PD) are conflicting, and no studies have examined the influence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the criterion standard treatment for OSA, on PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between OSA with incident Parkinson disease among US veterans and risk modification by CPAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This electronic health record (EHR)–based cohort study was conducted among US veterans from January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2022, with mean (SD) follow-up of 4.9 (1.8) years. Veterans with PD at the time of exposure or incomplete records were excluded. Data analysis was completed from September 2024 to September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OSA was defined by its appropriate administrative code; CPAP usage was extracted from a semistructured medical interview field in the EHR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome, cumulative incidence of PD, was calculated adjusting for competing risk of death after balancing for age, race, sex, and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 13 737 081 US veterans were screened, and 11 310 411 veterans (1 109 543 female veterans [9.8%]) with mean (SD) age of 60.5 (14.7) years were included in analyses. Of included veterans, 1 552 505 (13.7%) had OSA. Veterans with OSA demonstrated 1.61 additional cases of PD (point estimate; 95% CI, 1.13-2.09) at 6 years from diagnosis per 1000 people compared to those without OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results were confirmed when adjusting for body mass index, vascular comorbidities, psychiatric conditions, and relevant medications and were of greater magnitude in female veterans. Case numbers were significantly reduced when treated with CPAP early in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this EHR-based cohort study, OSA appeared to be an independent risk factor for the later development of PD and could be modified by early treatment with CPAP. Effective screening measures and protocols for consistent adherence to CPAP may have large impacts on brain health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9wUV91M0xIeU5lYi1mektoaWVERXh4RDVwSTlGN2E3LWpSZzBDTl9BNndjT1owdVlCT09KT3lzYUNiYVY0WFJndUJxbF9Tbjd3THFPc3Fabm91dE9yZFdBbFlYOXBnb202c21WeQ</guid></item><item><title>在40多岁的时候挣扎？对于许多女性来说，这是围绝经期-黎明</title><link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1957297</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dawn</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:48:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiSEFVX3lxTFB6OThtajlzRUlISHFFbXpQU290V3p2WUx1cjVZakZTQkpSVVpHcE5PSklEdkllcWhrMERuLTdUeHpUcXJQT0dGNdIBTkFVX3lxTE16ejBFRFpYamdpU3lxM25Ub2ZNMUJiaHJaY2kwN2phNC05M1dsQXJEdFFOMWNCRGtvaVlOTk1NS295RTRxRThfbFBfanRidw</guid></item><item><title>以下是大餐如何影响您的心脏-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/11/25/big-meal-heart-attack/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3F7BK6HQNBDN7NNZDUCTVNSBKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is it true that eating a big meal can lead to a heart attack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:32:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE42RTZtUERyRHE0N0FOUTg3cjYxRlFMc2xEMjB4TE05bGlFUGQ0cllrTEowQVo5bkV4cmhTVGYzNE9VNDJscW9XbVRRNHF0RVQxMzY3OGJURXB1dkZkYVRDNHB0OFJ1aXJENzBITFdmVVZYY2JfSVdFQnI4UFFWdw</guid></item><item><title>渡渡鸟肉的味道如何？这个1601账户似乎与一个常见的误解相矛盾- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/what-did-dodo-meat-taste-like-probably-better-than-youve-been-led-to-believe-81682</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;Have you heard that dodo meat tasted foul? Loathsome, even. You’re not alone. It’s a strangely prevalent rumor, given that nobody alive today has ever eaten one. However, it’s quite possible that this “fact” is one that got lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known to science as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/there-was-only-ever-one-species-of-dodo-study-clears-up-400-years-of-confusion-75625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raphus cucullatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dodos also went by the nickname “wallowbird”, said to have been inspired by the way their meat made people sick. But as Jan den Hengst, author of &lt;em&gt;The Dodo: The Bird That Drew the Short Straw&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/E0260954108000697?journalCode=anh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2009 study&lt;/a&gt;, this dodo meat review may have been misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;em&gt;The Dodo And Scientific Fantasies: Durable Myths Of A Tough Bird&lt;/em&gt;”, Hengst explores primary Dutch sources dating from 1598 to 1602 to see how people were really reviewing dodo meat. The accounts encompass sailors, merchants, and captains who encountered dodos when visiting their native home of Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms “lothsome” and “fulsome” have historically been used as evidence that dodo meat tasted unpleasant, but as Hengst uncovers, these trace back to an English translation – not the original source. It was inspired by the Dutch phrase de walgch (“the heaves”), which Hengst says more accurately reflects nausea from either eating too much of something, or something that’s tough. Not because it was disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EBFpj60LRY??si=x0JJM2cfeZuVoiAk&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A translation included in the study that supports this comes from a 1601 second edition of Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck’s report, &lt;em&gt;A true report of the gainefull, prosperous and speedy voiage to lava…&lt;/em&gt;. In it, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These birds we called Wallowbirds, on the one hand because, even though we cooked them for a long time, they were very tough to eat, although the breast and the stomach were very good and, on the other, we were able to catch large numbers of turtle doves, which we found to be much more pleasant in taste. The crew became sick from eating the dodo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dodo meat really were so disgusting, it seems unlikely the crews would be going to much effort to catch and kill them. The reports also chronicle how sailors would salt down leftover dodo meat so it could be consumed in transit. Again, not something you’re likely to do with a foodstuff that’s gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be that the mixed reviews surrounding dodo meat come down to a catch that arises when eating many kinds of poultry: the older the bird, the tougher the meat. Dodos enjoyed no predators until humans came along, so there were birds marching around that would’ve been very old. It’s possible, then, that the negative reviews were coming from people eating dodos that were past their prime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thus although later writers made no mention of an unpleasant taste, this culinary quality still took on a life of its own, particularly because of the addition of the two English words 'lothsome' and 'fulsome',” wrote Hengst. “In fact, if anyone had had an unpleasant experience when consuming a dodo drumstick, the bird would subsequently have been freed from the dangers of the hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chance would be a fine thing for our poor extinct dodo. Today, it's known from just a handful of specimens, most of which are just pieces. Still, we may see a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/de-extinction-of-the-dodo-takes-another-step-closer-to-reality-71704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dodo-like bird&lt;/a&gt; in the years to come as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/de-extinction-should-we-bring-extinct-species-back-from-the-dead-76167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;de-extinction&lt;/a&gt; marches on, but &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/iflscience-the-big-questions-is-de-extinction-really-possible-80684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;is de-extinction possible&lt;/a&gt;?

Blood lactate levels and systolic blood pressure also increased after exercises. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70171"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychophysiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance exercises are physical activities that make muscles work against an external force, such as weights, resistance bands, or one’s own body weight. They are designed to increase muscle strength by challenging the muscles to contract against this resistance. Common forms include weightlifting, push-ups, squats, and exercises using machines in a gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises trigger muscle fibers to adapt and grow stronger over time. Resistance training can also help improve bone density, which is especially important for preventing osteoporosis. It boosts metabolism because stronger muscles burn more calories even at rest. Such exercises are valuable for improving balance and coordination, particularly in older adults. They also reduce the risk of injuries by strengthening the muscles that support joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Nicholas W. Baumgartner and his colleagues note that resistance exercise has emerged as a critical component of health, playing a key role in regulating blood glucose, reducing obesity, and lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a study aiming to evaluate the effects of acute resistance exercises on executive function and to explore potential mechanisms underlying those effects. Executive function is the set of mental processes that enable a person to plan, focus attention, remember instructions, control impulses, and coordinate complex goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 121 healthy adults. Their age ranged between 18 and 50 years, with the average being 27 years. 41% of them were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors randomly divided them into two groups. One was to undergo resistance exercises of moderate difficulty, while the other group rested watching a video. The data collection was done on two separate days. On the first day, participants completed a demographic survey, and tests of strength (1RM protocol) and cardiovascular fitness (graded maximal exercise test for VO2 max).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their next visit, which was at least 2 days after the first visit, participants gave blood samples and had electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of their brain recorded while they completed a set of cognitive tasks measuring executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, depending on the group they were assigned to, participants either completed a set of resistance exercises or watched a video of a same-sex adult performing resistance exercises. After this period, they again gave blood samples and completed the cognitive tasks assessing executive function while the EEG activity of their brains was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resistance exercises lasted for 42 minutes. They started with a 2-minute warm-up followed by two sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise: chest press, latissimus dorsi pulldown, dumbbell bicep curl, leg press, cable triceps extension, and leg extension. They were set at 65-75% of the maximum strength for each participant separately, with 1–2-minute rest periods between sets and 2–3-minute rest periods between exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that response times for inhibitory control and working memory moderately improved in the group that completed resistance exercises compared to the group that watched videos. As expected, blood lactate levels and systolic blood pressure strongly increased after exercises as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors tested a statistical model proposing that increased systolic blood pressure mediates the link between exercises and improved executive functions (inhibitory control and working memory). In other words, they proposed that resistance exercises increased systolic blood pressure and that increased pressure improves the speed of executive functioning. Results showed that such a mediation is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, these findings provide evidence that acute RE [resistance exercises] enhances neuroelectric and behavioral markers of inhibitory control and working memory performance and highlight the potential for systolic pressure as a mechanism through which acute RE influences cognition,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the effects of resistance exercises on cognition. However, the effects on cognition were measured immediately after the exercises, so it remains unknown how long the effects last. If the improved executive functioning is indeed caused by increased blood pressure, as study authors suggest, it is likely that they would return to baseline together with blood pressure, which is within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70171"&gt;Brawn and Brainpower: Acute Resistance Exercise Improves Behavioral and Neuroelectric Measures of Executive Function,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Nicholas W.

The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect your child and family from measles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Any unvaccinated students who may have been exposed were directed in the letter to “stay home from school for 21 days,” which is the measles incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;After that guidance was issued, attendance at the high school Monday wasn’t significantly affected, a district spokesperson told The Salt Lake Tribune in a statement, directing all other questions to the Wasatch County Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In Utah, K‑12 students must complete two rounds of vaccinations to attend public school: one before kindergarten and another before seventh grade, with different immunizations required at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;However, the law allows parents to request exemptions from all or some of the required vaccinations for medical, religious and personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;state health department’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the exemption rate for kindergarten and seventh grade students has increased “dramatically since the pandemic.” During the 2024-25 school year, 9% of kindergarteners and 9% of seventh graders statewide had exemptions to one or more vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Wasatch County health officials have noticed the trend, said Lana North, a spokesperson for the county health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“What we’re trying to do is just help people understand,” North said. “The biggest recommendation really is the MMR vaccine. And the reason that is is because it’s got about a 97% effectiveness rate, meaning that 97% of time, you’re not going to get sick if you’ve been fully vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:01:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQUDg4aUdvanVvbU1ON0ljUVpXakdvRlplTmRtNzVRdDF1UGhXemtJUXlsTW5PZlRwTDZYWFdCZFE0QVRnSFlwQzkzaVN1VDZ1c1NkVVAwWFotSUZmY0psUEoxM0hMR1ZxRkFNclAtODVub0NPLUp2UkRFN2NMdlVtZA</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心网站更新后，家长应了解的关于自闭症和疫苗的哪些信息- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/autism-vaccines-parents-explainer-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Until last week, parents who looked at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website on autism and vaccines would see a few key points: Studies have not found links between &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;, nor have links been identified between any vaccine ingredients and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidqwuts000v3b6qssm0v2y2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the direction of US Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, the CDC page now has a different message: “Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidq41yb000o3b6qenyqywr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the change was made to “reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” But it drew a swift and sharp rebuke from doctors, scientists and advocates for people with autism, who say the website now includes misinformation and outdated and disproven ideas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidpmsy1000k3b6q834zmsq4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Medical researchers across the globe have spent more than 25 years thoroughly studying this claim. All have come to the same conclusion: Vaccines are not linked to autism,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/statement-from-leading-medical-health-and-patient-advocacy-groups-on-cdc-autism-website-changes/" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from more than 60 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the Autism Science Foundation.

        What does research into autism and vaccines show?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00063b6nvnpz745d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 studies involving over 5.6 million people to conclude that there is no link between vaccines and autism, said Dr.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sean O’Leary, a professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and Children’s Hospital Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidnfp1s00013b6q2mjtpntg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Links between vaccines and autism have “been debunked many times,” O’Leary, who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said at a news briefing last week. “It is considered settled science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00073b6ngy1bfkjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer for the Autism Science Foundation, noted that &lt;a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/autism-and-vaccines-read-the-science/" target="_blank"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; in countries including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Israel and Japan collected data from large groups of people and tracked their vaccination patterns and whether they had an autism diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9kdz4l000f3b6qqr2oj6sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of those studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism,” she said. “It remains the number one studied environmental factor in autism, and there is no link whatsoever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00093b6nlozutkwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed on many of the other purported causes of autism, she said, “but vaccines have 1,000% been exonerated” as a factor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiekls1t000l3b6q8rxc9z15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, &lt;a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2025/11/leading-autism-and-disability-organizations-statement-on-cdcs-vaccines-and-autism-page/" target="_blank"&gt;30 autism and disability organizations&lt;/a&gt; said linking autism and vaccines confuses parents. They called on the CDC “to revert the website to its previous version, commit to vaccine education initiatives around the country that emphasize the high-quality, scientific evidence that vaccines do not cause autism, and invest in research projects and initiatives that are responsive to the needs of autistic people and their families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmi9htp9m001a3b6n7awy2jg5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="where-did-claims-about-autism-and-vaccines-start" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Where did claims about autism and vaccines start?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000b3b6ncgt1150u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pervasive myth linking vaccines and autism largely grew out of a 1998 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9500320/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by a British gastroenterologist named Dr. Andrew Wakefield that tied the measles, mumps and rubella shot to autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000c3b6nz4aywz6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the paper had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/vaccines-fast-facts"&gt;major flaws&lt;/a&gt;: It included only about a dozen children and no control group; financial conflicts of interest; and fabricated data. Wakefield has long pushed back on criticisms of the study, but the paper was retracted in 2010 and Wakefield’s medical license was revoked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000d3b6nmavl5dzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many parents want to find an explanation for what was causing their children’s autism and to have “someone to blame,” Halladay said — and shots quickly became a scapegoat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000e3b6nx9eoo4su@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reality is that getting vaccinated isn’t exactly a fun procedure to begin with. You take your child to a pediatrician’s office, and they get a shot. They’re crying. It’s loud. It’s not a pleasant experience,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidrfkc300123b6qmpcddh2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If parents can believe that there is “something that they might be able to do to stop [their child’s autism], and also get to avoid those visits, they’ll do it. It’s really preying on the fears of parents and the idea that parents can do something to prevent their child’s autism. It’s taking advantage of parents who are vulnerable in that way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After Wakefield’s paper was published, a flurry of research was conducted around the world&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to try to replicate the results, but the research came to much different conclusions than Wakefield’s paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It was retracted, but at the same time … the bell had been rung,” Halladay said: The claims of a link between autism and vaccines had taken hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmie3ikrf00003b6qe6v2b549@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/autism-rate-cdc-report-2022"&gt;autism diagnosis rate&lt;/a&gt; has increased among US children, continuing a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition. About 1 in every 31 children was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, up from 1 in 36 in 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000a3b6nhi9y5zhs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Autism is complex, encompassing a spectrum of people who “are able to communicate and also have cognitive abilities and live independently, all the way to those needing 24/7 care,” Halladay said. This diversity is reflected in how there “can’t possibly be one cause for autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000b3b6n0pfouzsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Autism is highly genetic, and more than &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01104-0" target="_blank"&gt;250 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been found to be associated with it. “In about 15% to 20% of cases, we can find a single gene that causes autism, and in other cases, there may be multiple genetic mutations interacting to cause autism,” O’Leary said. “Genes that are associated with autism are highly expressed during fetal brain development and pregnancy, and they converge on biological pathways that involve how nerve cells communicate with each other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000c3b6ng8lbauzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some environmental factors, including maternal illness during pregnancy, can also “increase the probability of an autism diagnosis,” Halladay said. This is one of the reasons it’s important for pregnant women to stay up to date on recommended vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000e3b6nzfl2stzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you have measles, you have a full-body rash. You have a fever that runs for days and days. You feel sick from being exhausted to having a fuzzy head to having respiratory problems to nausea for days and days, not just a few hours,” Halladay said. “ So this is much more serious than any reaction that you might have to the vaccine, which isn’t universal. Some people may have a fever for a few hours, but it’s nothing like getting actually sick with these diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000f3b6n763j8z7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other factors that have been associated with autism include premature birth, parents who are older at the time of conception, fever during pregnancy and metabolic disorders such as gestational diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The update to the CDC’s website was not science-based, Halladay said, and that can be confusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000i3b6nj6k1384c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been telling families for years to go to the CDC website, the CDC website has the information that you need, and now, all of a sudden, the information that was posted did not come from the CDC,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmie3uvy600083b6qia6zuxn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
             “This current information was not vetted by any of the scientists from the Centers for Disease Control. It was shared by administrators at the Department of Health and Human Services, so it really isn’t scientific information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Peer countries in Europe and the UK, Canada and Mexico all “have stood by the statement that vaccines do not cause autism,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000v3b6nzthcbejw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Halladay’s other advice to parents: “Trust your pediatrician. These are the people that know you. These are the people that see you in person and you know and can give you the best advice.”

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bones are living tissue and get stronger with regular movement, good nutrition, rest and care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight-bearing exercise, protein, calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients all help preserve bone strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small weekly habits—like mindful movement and prioritizing recovery—can keep bones strong for life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our bones are not as solid and stagnant as they may seem. They’re living tissue that renews itself constantly, and they require regular care. As adulthood advances, especially past midlife, bone strength becomes even more important. Weak bones increase the risk of fractures and can affect mobility, and when bones or joints feel achy or stiff, it can be a sign that your body needs more support through movement, nutrients or rest.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, peak bone mass is usually attained by around age 30, so what you eat and how you move when you’re younger forms the foundation for how strong your bones will stay later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about building resilience, preserving mobility and maintaining vitality well into older age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A combination of diet, movement, sleep and everyday habits plays a major role in how strong and steady our bones stay throughout life. And while more women than men are affected by osteoporosis, stronger bones are not just a women’s issue. Everyone benefits from routines that help keep bones strong and steady.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are seven weekly habits that dietitians recommend to help keep your bones healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-move-your-body-with-purpose"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Move Your Body with Purpose &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to protecting bone health, movement is medicine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try to include resistance training at least twice a week and add some impact activities, if your body allows. Even simple habits like taking the stairs or carrying groceries can count.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dawnjacksonblatner.com/about-dawn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains, “For someone who can’t or doesn’t want to do high-impact exercise like running or jump rope, the best exercises for bones are low-impact, weight-bearing exercise and  muscle-strengthening exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Weight-bearing exercise is when your body holds itself up against gravity. Although high-impact workouts are great for bones, lower-impact options such as brisk walking, marching or stair climbing are still great options.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jackson Blatner adds, “Muscle-strengthening exercise is when your muscles work against resistance. Body weight and bands are a great place to start to build muscle, and then working toward using weights, like free weights and/or machine weights. The weight puts stress on your muscle and bone in a good way, and encourages them to be stronger.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jackson Blatner also reminds women that strong muscles and bones go hand in hand. “Strong muscles are your bones’ best friend. Muscles tug on bones, so anything that strengthens the muscle, is also strengthening the bone. Bottom line: You’re never just exercising muscle; you’re also training the bones underneath it.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you need one action step to try this week, Blatner says, “Do something that safely challenges your muscles, which in turn helps your bones. For example, sign up for a weight-lifting class at your local gym, pick up a slightly heavier weight than last week or do some jumps (hopscotch, anyone?).”
&lt;/p&gt;

Prioritize Nutrients for Healthy Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; often gets top billing for bone health, but it’s only part of the picture. Your body also needs other important nutrients to build and maintain bone structure. According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwardrd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Elizabeth Ward, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, “Several nutrients contribute to bone health, including protein, magnesium and vitamin K. Protein is necessary to make bone cells, and you need enough of it to build muscle that helps to keep you strong and upright. Vitamin K flies under the radar, but the body needs it to make a protein that activates bone cell production. The isoflavones in soy foods, such as tofu, tempeh and edamame, help slow down bone loss after menopause, too.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If calcium is Batman, vitamin D is Robin. It’s the trusty sidekick that helps calcium do its job by making sure it’s absorbed and used where it’s needed most: in your bones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://kerigansny.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keri Gans, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, agrees that a food-first approach matters. “Food should always come first, but supplements can be important for many people. If your diet doesn’t provide enough calcium, vitamin D or other bone-supporting nutrients, supplements may work to fill the gaps. However, you’ll get the best results when they’re combined with calcium- and vitamin D-rich foods as part of an overall balanced diet. Foods like dairy, fortified plant milks, tofu, canned salmon with bones and leafy greens all contribute to stronger, healthier bones.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Include Prunes a Few Times a Week &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may sound surprising, but research shows that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; can help preserve bone density, a distinction they share with other bone-building foods like dairy, leafy greens and fortified plant milks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Their unique blend of polyphenols and boron supports bone formation and may help reduce bone loss.

Research suggests that prunes may help inhibit bone resorption.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try blending prunes into smoothies, chopping them into salads, or eating a few as a sweet afternoon snack.

Be sure to read food labels to be more aware of the sources of sodium in your typical day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Don’t Forget About Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in calcium absorption, yet most people don’t get enough from food or sunlight alone. While we use sunscreen to protect our skin from wrinkles and damage as we age, it can also limit vitamin D production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ward says, “It’s difficult for most women to satisfy the 15 micrograms per day suggested vitamin D intake because very few foods have vitamin D. You should try to eat vitamin D–rich foods every day, such as salmon (sockeye), mushrooms exposed to UV light, fortified dairy and soy milk and breakfast cereal (some yogurt has added vitamin D, too). You can fill in the gap with vitamin D supplements. There’s no need to go overboard on the supplements, however.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Short, regular bouts of sun exposure combined with vitamin D–rich foods and modest supplementation can help bridge the gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-prioritize-recovery--sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Prioritize Recovery &amp;amp; Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rest and recovery are essential for strong bones. During sleep, your body repairs tissues, balances hormones and regulates processes that affect bone remodeling. Hormones play a major role in bone density, especially around menopause when estrogen levels begin to decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The biggest shift for bone health, starting in perimenopause, is decreasing estrogen levels,” says Ward. “Estrogen supports bone by discouraging bone cell breakdown and encouraging new bone cell production. Estrogen also protects bone tissue by suppressing inflammation and oxidation of bone cells, which contributes to a decline in bone density.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ward adds, “Nutrition and lifestyle can help offset some of the effects of estrogen loss, but not entirely.” The point is to do as much as you can to reduce bone loss. Ward tells us, “That means not smoking, exercising regularly and following a balanced diet rich in plants that provide isoflavones, magnesium, vitamin K and other nutrients, along with adequate protein, calcium and vitamin D.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-make-a-weekly-bone-check-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Make a Weekly Bone-Check Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strong bones aren’t built overnight. Setting aside a few minutes each week to check in on your movement, meals and self-care can make a lasting difference. Gans suggests making these mini check-ins part of your weekly rhythm. “Ask yourself: Did I move my body and consume enough calcium- and vitamin D–rich foods this week? A quick check like that helps keep bone health at the forefront,” Gans suggests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gans also reminds us that progress doesn’t require perfection. “Add calcium-rich foods regularly, stay active most days and get some sunlight for natural vitamin D. Small, steady actions have a much bigger impact than one-off efforts.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you think bone health is just for older women, Gans clears that up: “Bone density peaks between ages 25 and 30, and men also lose bone mass with age. Everyone benefits from protecting their bones early and maintaining healthy habits throughout life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consistency counts more than perfection. Bone health depends on everyday actions that add up over time, including nutritious meals, weight-bearing movement, quality rest and regular check-ins with your body. Every week you choose to move, eat well and care for your bones, you’re investing in strength that supports you for life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Jackson Blatner reminds us, “Bones are alive, and they can get stronger at any age if you work them.”&lt;br&gt;

                Drugmakers have developed pill versions of GLP-1 medicines to treat obesity.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of people use injectable drugs like Wegovy to reach a healthier weight. But the weekly injections aren't for everybody — or every wallet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why experimental pills that could achieve similar results are drawing so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The medicines haven't yet won approval from the Food and Drug Administration, but the first one could get the green light by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The patient community in the obesity space has … gone without treatment for so long," says &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/about/governance/staff/" target="_blank"&gt;Tracy Zvenyach&lt;/a&gt;, director of policy strategy and alliances at the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity Action Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. "So new innovations, new treatments to treat this chronic disease — all are welcome. All are exciting." The coalition &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/wp-content/uploads/OAC-Annual-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;receives financial support from multiple drugmakers&lt;/a&gt;, including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know — from how much the pills might cost to how they work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Two new pills are (probably) coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's obesity pill is expected to be approved first. It has the same ingredient — semaglutide — that's in Wegovy, Ozempic and also in Rybelsus, the company's Type 2 diabetes pill that was approved in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The difference between this new pill and Rybelsus is the dose. There's more semaglutide in the new pill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's main competitor is Eli Lilly, which makes Zepbound and Mounjaro. And it's working on an obesity pill, too. But instead of using the same ingredient that is in its blockbuster injectables, tirzepatide, the company is working on a new one for its obesity pill that is called orforglipron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Patients will take the pills daily, not weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pills need to be taken every day, but the injectables are once a week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Novo Nordisk, it was a challenge making a semaglutide pill that wasn't immediately broken down in the stomach before the medicine could be absorbed. So the scientists there added an ingredient that would protect the pill for 30 minutes while it is being absorbed. It's a mouthful: sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl]amino)caprylate, or SNAC for short.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you think about dropping an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a glass of water, that immediate fizzy reaction that occurs, that is what happens in your stomach," says Andrea Traina, one of Novo Nordisk's obesity directors. "It creates this little foamy environment directly around the tablet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That foam prevents a stomach enzyme from breaking the tablet down, lowers the stomach's acidity ever so slightly, and makes the cells under the pill a little bit more permeable so the semaglutide can get absorbed into the bloodstream more easily. The process takes about 30 minutes. It has to be taken on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly's orforglipron is a little different. It's not as vulnerable to being broken down in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It has no food or water restrictions," says Dr. Max Denning, one of Eli Lilly's senior medical directors. "You can take it orally, and it's very effectively absorbed without any additional absorption enhancers or administration restrictions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They both work, but one appears to have an edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a study published in September in the&lt;em&gt; New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;/em&gt; a 25 mg semaglutide pill led to a &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=916429" target="_blank"&gt;16.6% reduction in weight&lt;/a&gt; on average over 64 weeks. That's about the same as Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, had a &lt;a href="https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-meaningful-weight" target="_blank"&gt;12.4% average weight loss&lt;/a&gt; at its highest dose over 72 weeks, which means it's less effective than injections on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drugs have similar side effects to the injectables, including nausea and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. These pills should cost less than the injectables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pills tend to be cheaper than injectables, so patients are hoping they'll be more affordable than the brand-name injected medicines with list prices of over $1,000 a month — and that insurance companies will be more likely to cover them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's easier to manufacture and the cost ultimately should be lower," says &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/richard-siegel" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Richard Siegel,&lt;/a&gt; co-director of the Diabetes and Lipid Center at Tufts Medical Center. "One of the big problems with all of the medicines in this arena has been the cost. And can we equitably get these medicines to the millions, really, of people who might benefit from them?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;a recent poll by KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit health policy research organization, 1 in 8 people is currently taking an injectable drug in this class. While most of them have at least some insurance coverage, more than half said they had difficulty affording the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since early 2025, the drugmakers have made these medicines available at a discount to patients not using their health insurance, and the prices have come down a bit over time. As of early November, when Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5599122/wegovy-zepbound-price-deal" target="_blank"&gt;announced deals with the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;, the starting dose of Zepbound will be available for $299 a month for people buying without using insurance. And Wegovy will now be&lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=916460" target="_blank"&gt; available for $349&lt;/a&gt; a month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While neither company has announced an official &lt;em&gt;list &lt;/em&gt;price for the experimental pills, their Trump administration deals say that if their oral obesity medicines &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;approved, they'll sell them directly to consumers for $149 a month. That means patients can get this price if they don't use their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, if the pills get better insurance coverage, copays could be significantly lower than that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The FDA could act soon on the first two, and more new drugs are in the works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's obesity pill is expected to win approval before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly, on the other hand, has said it will submit orforglipron for FDA approval this year. The drug won a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-awards-second-batch-national-priority-vouchers" target="_blank"&gt;priority review voucher&lt;/a&gt; from the agency, which could mean the agency will make a decision "within months."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also working on the next generation of these drugs, which could prove to be even more effective than the ones already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk is studying another compound called cagrilintide and a combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide. And Eli Lilly is studying retatrutide. Both are in Phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another company, Metsera, has several obesity drugs in its pipeline, though none is in late-stage clinical trials yet. Novo Nordisk tried to acquire the company, but it ultimately lost out to Pfizer, which completed the acquisition that &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/metsera-pfizer-accept-offer-novo-ftc-obesity-drugs/805080/" target="_blank"&gt;could ultimately be worth more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Keep your lower back pinned to the floor, return to the start position and switch sides for eight reps per side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hanging L-Sit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hang from a bar, engage the core and lift your straight legs to hip height," says Morgan Hold. “Hold some more.

No half reps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strong quads, hamstrings, and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-stretch-your-glutes"&gt;glutes&lt;/a&gt; improve sprint speed, hill work, balance, and protect your knees and hips,” says Morgan, which is why you should consider working a leg day into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Beginner leg exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box Squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A great way to build form when squatting is by standing in front of a box or chair, then, with a barbell across your shoulders, sitting back with control until your bum touches the box,” says Morgan. “Keep your chest proud, back straight, and drive the weight up through your heels for one. Then, adjust the box height and weight so every rep feels solid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPTlRKUHFWUGtZS1BhM0Z4bEp6VElHOGdzR1A4N1haYmY1UVAxRDZXcTQ2ME1iVExRWTFSMmx5dTdtTVo5TURneVA5NldIeFVjdlBaR2xXVS1TV2x5Sk5wcWlMQVhfSzBENUVKWjVvZXZaamcxRU9FcWdOcVJEMFIzbTY4dlR3X0U</guid></item><item><title>每年感恩节都会飙升的隐性疾病- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/health/470278/thanksgiving-dinner-turkey-high-blood-pressure-hypertension</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a silent killer that lurks among us, helping to claim millions of lives every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, the number of kids under age 19 who have high blood pressure has &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642%2825%2900281-0/abstract?utm_source=semafor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide since 2000. The rest of the population isn’t faring much better either: In the US, nearly half of Americans have hypertension — &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the rate from a generation ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Many Americans, particularly young adults, don’t know they have high blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;If unchecked, high blood pressure can lead to a lot of health problems: heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, and even dementia.

And I’m sorry, but the news gets worse: Thanksgiving is the disease’s favorite time of year. It seems our social calendar and our food supply are conspiring to give each of us this too-often-overlooked condition — with potentially deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/38/2/120/7879521"&gt;Only about half&lt;/a&gt; of the people who have hypertension have it under control, a figure that has been declining over the past 10 years, even though this is among the most tractable public health problems that we have. With better monitoring, lifestyle modification, and medication, it is possible to reduce someone’s high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the problem is, many of the people who have it, especially younger patients, are totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-hypertension-is-so-dangerous" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why hypertension is so dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What is high blood pressure, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your blood pressure measures how hard the blood pumping through your veins is pushing against the walls of your arteries, and it serves as a proxy for how hard your heart and circulatory system have to work to move blood through your body. If you’ve ever had a physical exam or a routine check-up with your doctor, you’ve probably had your measurement taken using either a manual or automatic cuff. The standard healthy reading is 120/80 (the top figure measures the pressure during a heartbeat, and the bottom measures the pressure during those brief moments in between heartbeats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If both numbers fall below that standard, it is considered to be a healthy reading. Anything above that starts to have negative consequences. First, arteries begin to harden, and organs can be damaged over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But high blood pressure and its effects on your body’s function can lead to other issues as well. It can damage your kidneys; hypertension is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney failure. It can damage your eyes, which are filled with tiny blood vessels, causing vision problems. And it can affect your cognition, driving up your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Both your kidneys and your brain rely on being efficient filters in order to function; when the blood vessels inside of them get damaged, they become less efficient at filtering the bad stuff out of your body or your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, your blood pressure starts to rise — and a wide range of health problems can follow. The most obvious are heart attacks and strokes: Your blood vessels are damaged, and they start to accumulate plaque that further slows the flow of blood. When your blood flow becomes too obstructed, you can have a heart attack (if the blockage is near your heart) or a stroke (if it is in your brain) or a pulmonary embolism (if it is in your lungs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When that happens gradually, it can lead to heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over the long term. Those conditions can kill you — either through a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. These are consistently among the leading killers in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and worldwide, and even if you survive, you can face permanent paralysis or other lifelong limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Its pernicious nature is why the medical community &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hyp.0000000000000065"&gt;changed the definition of high blood pressure in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, significantly increasing hypertension rates in the US. Before then, the cutoff for high blood pressure was actually 140/90; anything between that and 120/80 was considered to be “pre” hypertension — a warning that you are on track for serious problems, but not in the final stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as research continued to show that heart and blood vessel damage could occur even at lower readings, scientists reconsidered. The final straw came in 2015 when &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/systolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial-sprint-study"&gt;a large clinical trial of more than 9,000 people&lt;/a&gt; with elevated blood pressure found that lowering the patients’ blood pressure from 140/90 to 120/80 could cut their risk of serious cardiovascular events by 25 percent. When the definition was changed, US hypertension rates jumped from about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20501926/"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm"&gt;nearly 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Far more people were at risk than had previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And yet, despite being so obviously dangerous and so widespread, many people still don’t know if they have high blood pressure. By one estimate, &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/news/increasing-proportion-of-adults-unaware-they-have-hypertension/"&gt;nearly 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults younger than 45 who have hypertension don’t know it. How can that be possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is no obvious sign that you have it — unless you get checked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;High blood pressure has a reputation among doctors as a “silent” killer: Patients sometimes experience no symptoms or very mild and vague symptoms. I once had a nurse remark to me that some people are walking around with blood pressures over 200 and have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is only through the repeated and consistent measurement of your blood pressure over time that you can know with certainty whether you have a problem. A one-off reading — say, while you’re waiting at the pharmacy — can be misleading in either direction. Your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, and even if you have hypertension, you can get a normal reading sometimes. Conversely, if you have a spike of stress while being measured, you could have a high reading even without an underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But here’s the problem: Many Americans, particularly young people, &lt;a href="/23817170/family-doctor-primary-care-physician-general-practitioner-shortage"&gt;don’t see a health care provider regularly&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly half of the people in the US under 30 don’t have a primary care physician. And they may be paying the price: Data &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/about-acc/press-releases/2019/03/07/08/45/heart-attacks-increasingly-common-in-young-adults"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; heart attacks and other cardiovascular events are up among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-manage-your-blood-pressure" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to manage your blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Hypertension, like many diseases, does have a genetic or hereditary component — if you have a family history, you are at higher risk — but if you regularly eat too much sodium and do not get enough exercise, you’re putting yourself at risk, too. A traditional Thanksgiving dinner, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/local/sodium-thanksgiving-healthy-holiday-meals/1933261/"&gt;can easily have more sodium&lt;/a&gt; than any person is supposed to eat in an entire day. And lying on the couch for the entire afternoon after that meal isn’t helping either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Luckily, Thanksgiving only comes once a year. But too many Americans eat salt-rich diets and stay sedentary the rest of the year, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You can change that. Doctors have come up with what they call &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet&lt;/a&gt; as the best strategy for managing your blood pressure. You should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, beans and nuts, and whole grains. You should try to eat foods that are high in fiber and potassium (which helps your kidneys filter sodium); you, of course, want low-sodium and low-fat foods too. I typically buy the no salt added or reduced sodium options for, for example, chicken broth. Red meats and processed foods, both of which are linked to hypertension, are your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the end, you want to eat between 1,500 and 2,000 milligrams of sodium in a day and no more. You could drink less alcohol and less caffeine, both of which raise your blood pressure temporarily, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the exercise front, working out is not always a foolproof weight-loss strategy — but it is proven to be effective in lowering your blood pressure. Walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, and even dancing are all good for you. But regardless of what you’re doing, your goal should be about 150 minutes per week. It is best to combine that classic “cardio” exercise with strength training (which both lowers blood pressure on its own and makes your aerobic workouts more effective) and even stretching and breathing routines like yoga, which can help regulate your heart and lead to better sleep. All of these things can help to keep your blood pressure down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is also &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/types-of-blood-pressure-medications"&gt;a wide range of existing blood pressure medications&lt;/a&gt;, which can be very effective but do come with some risks, such as blood thinners that can cause excessive bleeding. We are entering a new age of medicine, however, in which wearable tech that allows patients to monitor their blood pressure minute by minute and GLP-1s are likely to become more commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Apple Watch rolled out &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296"&gt;a blood pressure monitoring capability&lt;/a&gt; this fall: You can turn on hypertension notifications, and your device will notify you if it detects consistently high blood pressure. The wearable tech company Oura Labs is working on something similar. Right now, the best way to monitor at home is to buy your own blood pressure cuff like the one at your doctor’s office; my own physician pointed me to the Omni units to monitor my blood pressure at home. They can cost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=omni+blood+pressure+cuff&amp;amp;adgrpid=186079070869&amp;amp;hvadid=779670021752&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvexpln=0&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9015344&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvocijid=9797264897866607049--&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=9797264897866607049&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-308821316558&amp;amp;hydadcr=21881_13323216_12880&amp;amp;mcid=d88a5aed6da23bbda9746bb329869e3e&amp;amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;amp;ref=pd_sl_70jzgnjqri_e"&gt;as little as $40&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have an FSA or an HSA, it is an eligible expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this can be a little inconvenient — you have to sit down, take a few minutes to get your blood pressure to “normal,” and then affix the cuff correctly to ensure you’ll get an accurate reading. Having the same capability walking around with you on your wrist at all times would be a boon, much like continuous glucose monitoring has helped people better manage their diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These are effectively brand new prototypes, however. As Apple itself &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt;, they should not be used to diagnose hypertension or to monitor and control it. Not everybody who has high blood pressure will have it detected by the Apple Watch. And it may not even be able to detect serious cardiac events, such as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Likewise, the new class of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajh/hpaf205/8300155"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; modest benefits for hypertension, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.scai.org/media-center/news-and-articles/glp-1-studies-add-growing-body-evidence-demonstrating-significant"&gt;reduced risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. But that science is preliminary. We still have a lot to learn about those drugs and, even if they are effective, they would work best in tandem with a blood pressure-conscious diet and exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that high blood pressure is a health problem you can do something about. You just have to figure out whether you have a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPdmpNYUJCLWFhSGNPMXBEOUZOemQtNFNnNHp1TXRSdlVwMmxqN214RnRVU1JHaVd2b1RkWnpwQjlSX2pWVFZwcnIyZU9jbE5WWTRKbE5Bb0xaZk5JRVlFVWhzY3EzQWJQSmx3Tmx3WWRpS1J0WWl3ejJvZ1BncnBNQlFsMlVoQnZxUXE2elVKckthNjhFWE01Wg</guid></item><item><title>这名蹒跚学步的孩子乘坐救护车将近40分钟，他的家人为此损失了9,000 $ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/11/25/ambulance-bill-uninsured/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="37YFXWXQWZHEDJYKM7PX3LWOCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Elisabeth Yoder’s son, Darragh, was 15 months old in August when he developed what at first looked to his parents like hand, foot and mouth disease.

The issue is among the most intensively studied in the scientific literature, and the results among the most conclusive: There’s no connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the revision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of its advisory on vaccines and autism struck like a thunderbolt, and not in a good way. The original statement was this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder ... No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="m-0"&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body"&gt;Dr. Cassidy, he lied to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— CNN’s Jake Tapper, citing RFK Jr.’s reneging on pledge he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to leave CDC advisories on childhood vaccinations unchanged&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, the statement says: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can’t say that the change was a bolt from the blue, because Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has telegraphed his intention to revisit the causes of autism for months. The change in the CDC language is merely the most concrete indication that his campaign against child immunizations is undermining the science of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;  &lt;ps-newsletter-module data-element="newsletter-module" class="@container/newsletter-module block" data-id="519" data-module-id="0000019a-b7ad-d00b-af9f-bfad20180013"&gt; &lt;div data-element="newsletter-module-layout" class="flex flex-col border-solid border-0 border-t border-cms-color-neutral-border @lg/newsletter-module:flex-row @lg/newsletter-module:gap-4"&gt;  &lt;div class="group"&gt; &lt;header class="flex flex-col flex-wrap gap-4 mb-2.25 pt-4 @lg/newsletter-module:pt-8 @lg/newsletter-module:flex-row"&gt;  &lt;h3 data-element="module-title" class="font-cms-font-brand-heading font-bold text-2xl leading-6.5"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;/header&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is much more to be concerned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reporting on RFK Jr.’s assault on public health since his name first surfaced as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-11-19/column-trumps-appointment-of-anti-vaxxer-rfk-jr-to-his-cabinet-has-scientists-fearing-a-catastrophe-for-public-health"&gt;a possible cabinet appointee&lt;/a&gt; in President  Trump’s second term.

Bill Cassidy (R-La.).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(CDC)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed a proponent of the discredited claim connecting vaccines and autism to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-01/rfk-jr-puts-anti-vaxxer-in-charge-of-studying-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;oversee a study of the purported link&lt;/a&gt;. He and Trump tried to associate autism among children with their mothers having taken Tylenol during pregnancy—and even &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-14/rfk-jr-tylenol-and-circumcision-the-lowdown"&gt;associating autism with circumcision&lt;/a&gt;. (There’s no scientifically validated evidence for those conjectures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, at his first news conference since taking office, Kennedy spouted a fountain of misinformation about autism. He called it an “epidemic” that is “running rampant,” which is untrue. He said “most cases now are severe,” which is untrue. In fact the vast majority of new cases involve children without the intellectual disabilities often associated with stereotypical autistic behavior, such as sensitivities to touch and an absence of verbal skills. The prevalence of more severe cases actually has declined in recent years, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/2/e2022056594/190525/Prevalence-and-Disparities-in-the-Detection-of" target="_blank"&gt;a study from Rutgers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy consistently has cited statistics pointing to years of increased autism prevalence, as reflected in ever larger diagnoses, suggesting they point to an “epidemic” of autism and blaming childhood vaccines as a likely factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-22/rfk-jr-s-views-on-autism-show-that-anti-science-myths-are-rampant-at-the-agency-he-leads"&gt;as I’ve reported&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have made great strides in unearthing the causes and characteristics of autism. Among other factors, they’ve identified genetic anomalies that may produce a predisposition to the condition. Scientific research has absolved vaccines as a cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism also has been defined ever more broadly over the years — indeed, it’s seen today as a smorgasbord of conditions summed up as “autism spectrum disorder. “ Despite all that, Kennedy continues to demonize childhood immunization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s altered webpage reflects what I’ve reported as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-22/rfk-jr-s-views-on-autism-show-that-anti-science-myths-are-rampant-at-the-agency-he-leads"&gt;Kennedy’s pseudoscientific mindset&lt;/a&gt;, relying on claims that have been standard fare for antivaccine activists like himself. Its assertion that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism” is a travesty of the scientific method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not well-equipped to prove a negative — as some of Kennedy’s critics note, there’s no proof that drinking Coca-Cola or eating pizza doesn’t cause autism, either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by casting doubt on autism research, Kennedy overlooks the research that has been done on vaccines and autism — studies of more than 2 million children around the world, finding no connections whatsoever. Instead, the CDC statement misrepresents some research it does cite, asserting that “approximately one in two surveyed parents of autistic children believe vaccines played a role in their child’s autism, often pointing to the vaccines their child received in the first six months of life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study the CDC cites for that claim was published in 2006 and was drawn from surveys of 150 parents of children diagnosed with ASD at two private medical practices; the parents were given a six-page, self-administered survey. Only 77 parents responded. Of the respondents, 54% mentioned immunizations as a possible cause of their children’s ASD, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper was “just about parents’ views, not the science of autism,” John Harrington, the paper’s lead author, told me. “It’s definitely not evidence-based in terms of whether vaccines cause autism.” The study itself states that its purpose was “to measure parental beliefs and not to measure their accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Kennedy’s agency to comment on this apparent misrepresentation but haven’t received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast radius from Kennedy’s change in the CDC website is vast. The first circle of damage is the possibility that it will encourage more parents to resist immunizations for their children. We already have seen the ramifications from the vaccine hesitancy encourage by Kennedy and his fellow antivaxxers: Reported measles cases in the U.S. reached 1,753 as of Nov. 18, the largest case load since 1991. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough also are on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next circle is the CDC’s own reputation, which Kennedy has relegated to the dumpster. Once arguably the most trusted public health agency in the world, the CDC has deteriorated into an untrustworthy “propaganda machine for RFK Jr.’s fixed, immutable, science-resistant theories,” vaccinologist Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia told researchers at the University of Minnesota. “The CDC is being &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/after-unprecedented-autism-vaccine-messaging-change-scientists-advocates-say-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;weaponized to promote RFK Jr.’s antivaccine point of view&lt;/a&gt;. So why should you trust it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those whose reputations are shattered along with the CDC’s under Kennedy’s onslaught is Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), whose vote was a key to confirming him as Health and Human Services secretary. That was because Cassidy, a physician, was skeptical about Kennedy’s suitability for the job, but folded his cards when Kennedy made him several promises, including that he wouldn’t touch the makeup of the vaccine advisory committee. Cassidy’s vote gave Kennedy the majority he needed for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has broken most of those promises. Last week’s breach was the most recent. In announcing his confirmation vote, Cassidy  said  Kennedy  pledged that “the CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy stuck to that pledge, somewhat — but in a way that arguably intensifies the humiliation he has delivered to Cassidy since the confirmation vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement “Vaccines do not cause Autism” is still on the CDC website, but it is now accompanied by an asterisk that refers to language asserting that the original statement remains posted “due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee [that is, Cassidy] that it would remain on the CDC website.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feels like a shiv aimed at Cassidy: The website undermines the claim that vaccines don’t cause autism and says the language remains only because of the promise Kennedy gave to Cassidy and no other. I asked Cassidy’s office if the senator took umbrage at the insult but got no reply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday on CNN, however, Jake Tapper put the issue forthrightly. “Dr. Cassidy,” he said, “he lied to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy dodged Tapper’s implication, repeating several times that “vaccines are safe” and accusing Tapper of trying to stir up a “titillating” fight between Republicans. As it happens, Kennedy in 2023 launched a campaign for the presidential nomination as a &lt;i&gt;Democrat&lt;/i&gt;, the party long identified with Kennedy’s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3c1335/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/320x89!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/020e8ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/568x158!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3c0a73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/768x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05bf37d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1024x284!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb442e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="measles" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b69322/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/320x89!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93c1881/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/568x158!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67a8277/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/768x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53ffc6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1024x284!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c405009/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c405009/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;With 1,753 U.S. cases of measles reported so far this year—the largest outbreak since 1992—RFK Jr.’s campaign against child vaccinations appears to be jeopardizing public health&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(CDC)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy also posted a tweet Thursday, after the CDC website change, stating, “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829" target="_blank"&gt;safe and effective and will not cause autism&lt;/a&gt;.

Los Angeles County recently reported its first flu death of the season, and other nations are reporting record-breaking or powerful, earlier-than-expected flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, flu picks up right after Christmas and into the New Year, but Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she expects increases in viral activity perhaps over the next two to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting an early and likely sharp start to the flu season,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s flu season was the worst California had seen in years, and it’s not usual for there to be back-to-back bad flu seasons. But a combination of a decline in flu vaccination rates and a “souped-up mutant” is particularly concerning this year, according to Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That may translate into more people getting infected. And as more people get infected, a proportion of them will go to the hospital,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of this new flu subvariant — called H3N2 subclade K — is particularly problematic. It emerged toward the end of the summer, long after health officials had already determined how to formulate this fall’s flu vaccine, a decision that had to be made in February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H3N2 subclade K seems to be starting to dominate in Japan and Britain, Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It looks like a bit of a mismatch between the seasonal flu vaccine strains” and the new subvariant, Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether subclade K will reduce the effectiveness of this year’s flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California and the rest of the U.S., “things are quiet, but I think it’s just a calm before the storm,” Chin-Hong said. “From what we see in the U.K. and Japan, a lot more people are getting flu earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that subclade K is not that much different than the strains this year’s flu vaccines were designed against. And he noted data recently released in Britain that showed this season’s vaccines were still effective against hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the British government, &lt;a class="link" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/11/11/how-well-will-i-be-protected-from-flu-this-year-with-the-current-uk-influenza-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; were 70% to 75% less likely to need hospital care, and adults were 30% to 40% less likely. Flu vaccine effectiveness is typically between 30% to 60%, and tends to be more effective in younger people, the British government &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is some degree of mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, “the flu vaccine still provides protection against severe illness, including hospitalizations,” according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public Health strongly encourages everyone who has not received the flu vaccine yet this year to receive it now, especially before gathering with loved ones during the holidays,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “while mismatched vaccines may still provide protection, enhanced genetic, antigenic and epidemiological ... monitoring are warranted to inform risk assessment and response,” according to scientists &lt;a class="link" href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025" target="_blank"&gt;writing in&lt;/a&gt; the Journal of the Assn. of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the vaccine is not a perfect match for the latest mutated flu strain, Chin-Hong said getting antiviral medication like Tamiflu to infected patients may be especially important this year, even for those who are vaccinated. That’s especially true for the most vulnerable, which include the very young and very old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But that means you need to get diagnosed earlier,” Chin-Hong said. Drugs like Tamiflu work best when started within one to two days after flu symptoms begin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now at-home flu testing kits that are widely available for sale for people who are showing signs of illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worrying is how the flu has surged in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s flu season came earlier this year and was more severe than usual. The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.racgp.org.au/the-racgp/about-us/about-the-racgp" target="_blank"&gt;Royal Australian College of General Practitioners&lt;/a&gt; said that nation saw a record flu season, with more than 410,000 lab-confirmed cases, up from the prior all-time high of 365,000 that were reported last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a record we want to be breaking,” Dr. Michael Wright, president of the physician’s group, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.racgp.org.au/gp-news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/october-2025/australia-posts-record-breaking-flu-numbers-as-vac" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson noted Australia’s flu season was “particularly hard on children” this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County health officials cautioned that Australia’s experience isn’t a solid predictor of what happens locally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to predict what will happen in the United States and Los Angeles, as the severity of the flu season depends on multiple factors including circulating strains, pre-existing immunity, vaccine uptake, and the overall health of the population,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strain has also thrown a wrench in things. As Australia’s flu season was ending, “this new mutation came up, which kind of ignited flu in Japan and the U.K., and other parts of Europe and Asia,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Japan reportedly issued a national alert with flu cases surging and hospitalizations increasing, especially among children and the elderly, accompanied by a sharp rise in school and class closures. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16175605" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; children ages 1 through 9 and adults 80 and up were among the hardest-hit groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese health officials warned of the possibility of a second peak in flu this year, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202511180022" target="_blank"&gt;Central News Agency&lt;/a&gt;. There was already a peak in late September and early October — a month earlier than normal — and officials are warning about an uptick in flu cases starting in December and then peaking around the Lunar New Year on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese officials said 95% of patients with severe flu symptoms had not been recently vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British health officials this month issued a “flu jab SOS,” as an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/11/nhs-issues-flu-jab-sos-with-worst-of-winter-only-weeks-away/" target="_blank"&gt;early wave&lt;/a&gt; struck the nation. Flu cases are “already triple what they were this time last year,” Public Health Minister Ashley Dalton said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, outside of pandemic years, this fall marked the earliest start to the flu season since 2003-04, scientists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Eurosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to brace ourselves for another year of more cases of flu,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major concern has been declining flu vaccination rates — a trend seen in both Australia and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, only 25.7% of children age 6 months to 5 years were vaccinated against flu in 2025, the lowest rate since 2021. Among seniors age 65 and up, 60.5% were vaccinated, the lowest rate since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian health officials are promoting free flu vaccinations for children that don’t require an injection, but are administered by nasal spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must boost vaccination rates,” Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., officials recommend the annual flu vaccine for everyone age 6 months and up. Those age 65 and up are eligible for a higher-dose version, and kids and adults between age 2 and age 49 are eligible to get vaccinated via the FluMist nasal spray, rather than a needle injection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials this year began allowing people to order FluMist to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration" target="_blank"&gt;mailed&lt;/a&gt; to them at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides getting vaccinated, other ways to protect yourself against the flu include washing your hands frequently, avoiding sick people and wearing a mask in higher-risk indoor settings, such as while in the airport and on a plane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy high-risk people, such as older individuals, can be prescribed antiviral drugs like Tamiflu if another household member has the flu, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are especially concerned about babies, toddlers and young children up to age 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are the kids that are the most vulnerable if they get any kind of a respiratory illness. It can really go badly for them, and they can end up extraordinarily ill,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, just 49.2% of children had gotten a flu shot as of late April, lower than the 53.4% who had done so at the same point the previous season, according to preliminary national &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. Both figures are well below the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;final flu vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for eligible children during the 2019-20 season, which was 63.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 46.7% had gotten their flu shot as of late April, slightly down from the 47.4% at the same point last season, according to the preliminary survey results, which are the most recent data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination coverage had been slowly increasing; downturns in coverage occurred during and after the pandemic. Flu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disparaging of vaccinations by federal health officials, led by the vaccine-skeptic secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has not helped improve immunization rates, health experts say. Kennedy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccines-autism-website.html" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times on Thursday that he personally directed the CDC to change its website to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream health experts and former CDC officials denounced the change. “Extensive scientific evidence shows vaccines do not cause autism,” wrote Daniel Jernigan, Demetre Daskalakis and Debra Houry, all former top officials at the CDC, in an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cdc-officials-rfk-jr-vaccine-autism-letter-rcna245128" target="_blank"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; to MS NOW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CDC has been updated to cause chaos without scientific basis. Do not trust this agency,” Daskalakis, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1991345475350589928?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; on social media. “This is a national embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials from California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii on Friday called the new claims on the CDC website inaccurate and said there are decades of “high quality evidence that vaccines are not linked to autism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over 40 high-quality studies involving more than 5.6 million children have found no link between any routine childhood vaccine and autism,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said Friday. “The increase in autism diagnoses reflects improved screening, broader diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness, not a link to vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said it’s important to get evidence-based information on the flu vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines save lives. The flu vaccine in particular saves lives,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQU0dRdzg4TThoZFJCZGU3U2dGbDBQbnFzU2xhVF9CRjIySFR2bjF1UFhNNThSbnZ6YVRocU1IbFRQbzJDZjBqR1ZwM3dTNnZLZE1vV1hPU3IzbzBhR3dZTlQzaHZkckdfUmtETzFhZ1owZ25UellGM2o3MTJBTDV0QjJrZ1Q5eXNKa0xMcHJSaE1UYkk0dnFxNzRXNEFtTnh4b0Y5RHJoVjhmZDRkQWRyYll6Mi1zTnR2</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，大脑有五个“时代” --成人模式要到30岁出头才开始--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPWndGQzA4eC10Qlk3VFd0VFJTVnJiNGFpa04zWkZ5aDNob0llQWVOczZwaXJ6S0hheVZyNkNwMlp1VVcwbWJpZVBERy1CM2VaYzNxYzhoZ2dHeHRYa3p1ajhHRGt4SGI4NnBWX1pPSEdLWWEwZkVJTG9BLXVPcURfeTVNNTZlU2VWSWktOFQyYWpMNHJlY2dTNHVGRDBiTVg5bWdrWjgwc3BralU2SXc</guid></item><item><title>科学家在一生中识别出人脑的五个年龄-剑桥大学</title><link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Theme-Layer-BodyText--inner"&gt;
                &lt;p class=""&gt;Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge have identified five “major epochs” of brain structure over the course of a human life, as our brains rewire to support different ways of thinking while we grow, mature, and ultimately decline. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A study led by Cambridge’s MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit compared the brains of 3,802 people between zero and ninety years old using datasets of MRI diffusion scans, which map neural connections by tracking how water molecules move through brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8"&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists say they detected five broad phases of brain structure in the average human life, split up by four pivotal “turning points” between birth and death when our brains reconfigure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Childhood brain “topology” runs from birth until a turning point at the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts right up to the age of 32, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our early thirties see the brain’s neural wiring shift into adult mode. This is the longest era, which lasts over three decades. A third turning point around age 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“We know the brain’s wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why,” said Dr Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research. &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p class="MsoNormal Theme-TextSize-xxxsmall"&gt;“This study is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives. It could help us understand why some brains develop differently at key points in life, whether it be learning difficulties in childhood, or dementia in our later years.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – overproduced in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Across the whole brain, connections rewire in the same pattern from birth until about nine years old.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;By the first turning point at nine years old, the brain is experiencing a step-change in cognitive capacity, as well as an increased risk of mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, sees white matter continue to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined, as measured by the diffusion of water in the scans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This era is defined by the efficiency of connections both within specific regions as well as rapid communication right across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Neural efficiency is as you might imagine, well connected by short paths, and the adolescent era is the only one in which this efficiency is increasing,” said Mousley.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;These developments peak in the early thirties, on average, which is the “strongest topological turning point” of the entire lifespan say researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Around the age of 32, we see the most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory, compared to all the other turning points,” said Mousley.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically. Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early thirties.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="Theme-TextSize-xxxsmall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adult brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At age 32, the longest era, that of adulthood, begins. Brain architecture stabilises compared to previous phases – with no major turning points for thirty years. This corresponds with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies, say researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;They also found “segregation” is more noticeable during this epoch, as regions slowly start to become more compartmentalised.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="Theme-TextSize-xxxsmall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early ageing brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;figure class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image media-size-100" data-lazyload-container="true" data-lazyload-trigger="true"&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The turning point at age 66 is far milder, and not defined by any major structural shifts, although researchers still found meaningful changes to the pattern of brain networks on average at around this age.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“The data suggest that a gradual reorganisation of brain networks culminates in the mid-sixties,” said Mousley. “This is probably related to ageing, with further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension.”  &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="Theme-TextSize-xxxsmall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late ageing brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;figure class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image media-size-100" data-lazyload-container="true" data-lazyload-trigger="true"&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The last turning point comes around age 83, and the final brain structure epoch is entered. While data is limited for this era, the defining feature is a shift from global to local, as whole brain connectivity declines even further, with increased reliance on certain regions.     &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” added senior author Prof Duncan Astle, Professor of Neuroinformatics at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The research was supported by the Medical Research Council, Gates Foundation and Templeton World Charitable Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Houston Methodist&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where you grow old in the United States may change your odds of developing &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/what-is-epilepsy-and-what-should-we-know-about-it-44338"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has mapped where older Americans are most likely to be diagnosed with epilepsy and points to a broad “epilepsy belt” running through the South, from Louisiana and Mississippi through Eastern Texas and Central Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work, led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University and Houston Methodist, focused on those 65 and older enrolled in traditional Medicare. This is the group that already faces the highest rate of new epilepsy diagnoses in the country, yet until now, no one had a detailed map of where those cases cluster and what local conditions might be linked to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed Medicare claims in the United States between 2016 and 2019, focusing on those who received a new diagnosis of epilepsy in 2019 and had no epilepsy-related claims in the previous three years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rate of new epilepsy diagnoses that year ranged from 141 to 1,476 cases per 100,000, a more than tenfold gap. Hotspots concentrated in Louisiana, Eastern Texas, Central Oklahoma and parts of the Deep South. Lower-rate regions appeared in stretches of the Great Plains, Midwest and Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That pattern looks strikingly similar to the long-known “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_Belt"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;” in the southeastern U.S., where stroke deaths have been high for decades. Stroke is the leading cause of epilepsy in older adults, so that overlap fits what neurologists already see in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-heat-and-everyday-barriers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep, heat and everyday barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So, what were some of the reasons for the seizures?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep stood out at the top of the list. In regions where a large share of adults reported sleeping less than seven hours per night, older residents were much more likely to live in an epilepsy hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep and epilepsy already have a tight relationship. Poor sleep can trigger seizures, and seizures can disrupt sleep. Sleep problems grow more common with age and are closely tied to poverty and chronic stress, which are more frequent in parts of the South and Appalachia that lit up on the map.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heat was another strong signal. Areas with more days where the heat index topped 95 degrees Fahrenheit tended to show higher epilepsy rates among older adults. Hot days cluster in southern states and are becoming more frequent as the climate warms. Long stretches of extreme heat strain the heart and blood vessels, unsettle sleep, and discourage outdoor activity — a mix that can feed into stroke and other brain injuries that later lead to epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Models also pointed toward physical inactivity, obesity, and a high share of uninsured adults as markers of high-incidence areas. Many of the regions with elevated epilepsy rates are areas where large numbers of people reach age 65 after decades with limited access to primary care and preventive services, often while living with untreated or poorly controlled chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regions with a larger share of residents working in agriculture or natural resources tended to have lower epilepsy rates, as did places with more recent arrivals from other states. The authors suggest that agricultural work may reflect more active daily lives and lower population density, and that high in-migration may point to healthier, more economically mobile populations. However, the researchers stress that those are informed guesses, not firm explanations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-and-does-not-tell-people"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this does — and does not — tell people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sits at the “ecological” level, meaning it looks at places rather than individual medical charts. It cannot be said that a particular person developed epilepsy because their county is hot, sleep-deprived, and car-poor. Personal risk still depends on many things such as stroke history, head injuries, infections, tumors, genetics, and sometimes unknown causes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, the patterns matter. The map clearly shows that epilepsy in older adults is not spread evenly across the country and that it tends to cluster in communities facing a long list of social and environmental challenges. Those conditions are not fixed. Better sleep health programs, stronger stroke prevention, heat-wave planning that protects older residents, improvements in transportation, and earlier insurance coverage could all reduce the number of people with vulnerable brains and limited care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the authors argue that public health agencies and policymakers can use their map as a guide. High-burden regions in the South may warrant extra neurologists, more stroke and sleep clinics and outreach tailored to communities with poor access to transportation and care. Lower-rate areas in the Midwest and West are not off the hook either; they can still learn from the patterns and protect gains as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For older Americans and their families, the message is simple but not hopeless: Epilepsy risk in late life is tied not just to biology but to the places people move through every day. Change the conditions in those places, and the map of epilepsy may change too.&lt;/p&gt;

It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring," Dr Alexa Mousley told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The five brain phases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="childhood" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Childhood &lt;/b&gt;- The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="adolescence" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Adolescence&lt;/b&gt; - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. "It's a huge shift," said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was "very interesting" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="adulthood" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Adulthood &lt;/b&gt;- Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Mousely said this "aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="early-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Early ageing&lt;/b&gt; - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="late-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Late ageing &lt;/b&gt;- Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different "ages align with a lot of important milestones" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'A very cool study'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge, said: "Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired.

&lt;p&gt;The Boston Public Health Commission disclosed its median syringe distribution per month for 2022 through Oct. 31, 2025, in response to a Herald public records request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data show that the city handed out 106,632 needles per month in 2022, which amounts to nearly 1.28 million in the first year of the Wu administration; 104,702 per month, or more than 1.25 million in 2023; 96,016 per month and more than 1.15 million in 2024, and 84,572 per month, or 845,720 so far this year, as Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2025 numbers put the city on pace to exceed the 1 million syringe distribution mark again this year, at more than 1.01 million, per city data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-2h6oj15u" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_2h6oj15u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 2025 numbers are down from the first three years of the Wu administration, they are higher than what Boston Public Health Commissioner Bisola Ojikutu &lt;a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/05/boston-distributes-80000-needles-to-drug-users-per-month-inflaming-mass-and-cass-tensions/"&gt;reported to the Boston City Council&lt;/a&gt; in early September. At the time, Ojikutu said the city distributes 81,112 needles on average per month to drug users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Commission, in its records response, declined to provide figures for how much the city is spending on distributing needles to drug users each year, but said that it collects more syringes through various programs than it distributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regarding yearly distribution costs, BPHC does not receive city appropriated funds for the purpose of syringe distribution,” BPHC Assistant General Counsel Javier Salas wrote. “The funds that we use come from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and therefore we do not have any responsive records.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a look at the city budget and a past Boston Public Health Commission request for proposals and quote for harm reduction supplies sheds light on what the city spends each year on needle distribution.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s budget line for “risk reduction and overdose prevention” was approved at just north of $2 million for this fiscal year, FY26. The BPHC sent out a request for proposals for harm reduction supplies in May 2024 that noted “the annual expenditure on supplies is approximately in the range of $1 million.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since fiscal year 2023, the City of Boston has received millions of dollars from the state for its harm reduction, treatment and recovery efforts, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-state-and-local-leaders-celebrate-525-million-in-funding-to-abate-opioid-crisis-in-massachusetts"&gt;as part of an opioid settlement&lt;/a&gt; with pharmaceutical companies. The &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission/boston-opioid-settlements"&gt;city will receive at least $40 million&lt;/a&gt; through 2039, which includes more than $14.7 million from FY23 through the current fiscal year, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/municipal-abatement-payments"&gt;according to a spreadsheet on the state website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BPHC’s request for proposals included other items beyond needles in the category of harm reduction supplies handed out by the city, among them: condoms and dental dams for safer sex, tourniquets, cotton pellets, saline and personal hygiene items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Commission, while including an extensive list of harm reduction supplies in its request for proposals, took issue with the Herald’s request for data on how many crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia it distributes.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Rather than provide the information as part of its records response, the Public Health Commission belittled the Herald’s chosen language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BPHC objects to the use of the terms: ‘crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia,” Salas wrote. “Smoking pipes is an overdose prevention strategy that makes it less likely for people to overdose compared to injections. Pipes are also better for public safety because they do not pose a biohazard risk to the public if discarded improperly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the extent you are requesting pipe distribution information, BPHC does not have reliable data to report accurate figures, which are only available in limited numbers,” Salas wrote, adding that he was rejecting the request for “other drug paraphernalia” due to it being “vague” and “broad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly-released needle data comes at a time when residents in neighborhoods taxed by the open-air drug use, dealing and related crime that’s spilled over from the troubled intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard are begging for a police crackdown and contemplating moving out of safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents, particularly in the South End, have complained about the health and safety risk discarded needles pose to their children at parks and playgrounds, and to their dogs out for walks with them around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 4-year-old boy had to undergo HIV testing this past summer after &lt;a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/28/south-boston-mom-calls-for-change-after-4-year-old-jabbed-by-needle-in-park/"&gt;stepping on a discarded needle&lt;/a&gt; at a South Boston park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man spoke at a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/26/furious-south-end-residents-see-moving-as-only-way-out-from-mass-and-cass-spillover/"&gt;South End public safety meeting&lt;/a&gt; last month of having to Narcan his dog who was overdosing from a discarded needle with drug residue, and advised others to carry the lifesaving overdose drug when walking their own pets in the neighborhood — a hot-spot area for spillover from Mass and Cass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ojikutu defended the city’s harm reduction approach at a City Council meeting in early September, as key to fending off HIV and other diseases that are commonly spread through shared needles used for drug injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you consider the number of times someone is using fentanyl — it’s 10 to 15 injections per day,” Ojikutu said. “We are trying to decrease the risk of HIV exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said the city’s Public Health Commission has identified a cluster of HIV cases in the Boston region. Most of the more than 200 HIV cases in the region are connected to Mass and Cass drug injection, Ojikutu said, adding that the number would be higher without the city’s harm reduction approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ojikutu said at the time that the city’s monthly needle distribution has decreased by 22% this year, compared to last year — although she acknowledged that the numbers of needles distributed each month is actually higher than disclosed by the city, when also accounting for its partner organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellie Young, director of the city’s coordinated response team, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/01/wu-official-indicates-boston-is-moving-away-from-harm-reduction-strategy-amid-mass-and-cass-surge/"&gt;indicated last month&lt;/a&gt; that the city may be moving away from its harm reduction approach, and will have recommendations for the mayor by January.&lt;/p&gt;
