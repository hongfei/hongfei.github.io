No other information about the person or the person's condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-720455" class="body-graf"&gt;Officials believe the sick person was bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, the release said. Officials are investigating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9824f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Plague is caused by bacteria that are most often transmitted via bites from fleas that were already carrying the bacteria after picking it up from squirrels, chipmunks and other rodents, according to health officials. Dogs and cats could also bring plague-infected fleas into homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8fcae" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of plague usually include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, and show up within two weeks of exposure. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it's diagnosed early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffefad" class="body-graf"&gt;Public health officials in California monitor rodents in the area to determine if they carry plague, the release said. From 2021 to 2024, 41 rodents were found to have been exposed to the plague bacteria. Four additional rodents tested positive in 2025, all identified in the Tahoe Basin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e984" class="body-graf"&gt;El Dorado County officials noted how rare human cases of plague are, with the last reported case in the South Lake Tahoe area in 2020. Prior to that, two people tested positive for plague in 2015 after exposure in Yosemite National Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bfc80" class="body-graf"&gt;"Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County," said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County's Acting Director of Public Health. "It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bbdfc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In order to prevent contracting plague, officials warned that people and pets should not touch squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents, especially those that are dead or injured. People should not camp near where dead rodents were observed and should wear long pants tucked into boots and spray bug repellant to reduce flea exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:53:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNR3dUbExBbXBSMnJzNGczQVRQbXg1bVZxcHV5dlBPTFctVTgyZ1JqZG1wNEpjMzFTVFlvZU14dm5IR0g1V2pMaDJXT0c3UjFHV3FJdENzaGpuX21PdFFYSzhkQ01OX2I2N2VsV0w1Y0t0TktsRFhYeVlmWWNydmFOaVF0VlI3a0tzTTl5UGl2c09lVE5iZkt0RXBVdDNkZHN5THFhVy03aWkwMjlyUl9qRGtDM3JCOXZBMUHSAVZBVV95cUxNQktDdG5ibnhoZkpkVHBxY3IzbXZuaEFQMllFOWpHMjdpSnBrT0dNT2x1dnYwamgtMnBOS1pRRXhqa3VBT2hpX3dEdF8yYVdqR3VoSy03dw</guid></item><item><title>加州居民鼠疫检测呈阳性- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNUEpObldqT3k5aUNubTM0T2R5ZFpTWlVvV0VZSElEdkc0MjQ3XzdXZS1uV3k3a2hiN1BhNklXUV9faUxQM3B4RVVUQl8zbF9JYUZna1RYOHB4TW9IWklOSHNpUjFTM2VyOVFJLUJCZVk3VXM2QUMwUjRSTDZ4STBERHE5SVNmYkQ0ZThYWU85YWEwNThY0gGaAUFVX3lxTE9OaEpFNVV3RE9hWHlaT096V190Q1FMSUN6LVZPNmxqdWE1VmRPQzFiOThLUTlLem1LM1dKNWszRVJMSmY5OTZ0T01ST09Lb0RTQ3NBRTNyOC1tUWl5VGFrZW9udkVtQUtXRFJScF9wQ2phV3RNWGR6U0J0cU5XRzA1LU5mb00wMUJJWE5GTDcxaU91b0hsd0dwNGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A resident in South Lake Tahoe, California, has tested positive for plague, according to local health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The person is believed to have been bitten by an infected flea while camping, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/pneumonic-plague-death-arizona-2c32ed6bd4a86be3d38828fe69aeb68b" target="_blank"&gt;separate incident last month&lt;/a&gt;, a person in Arizona died from plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Plague is a disease caused by a type of bacteria that usually results in about seven cases nationally each year, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It occurs naturally in areas of the western U.S., where it circulates among wild rodents and other animals.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers took blood plasma samples from 841 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairments, and cognitively healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The samples were then examined for markers of brain inflammation and damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After analysing 700 individual lipids, scientists found that women with Alzheimer's had significantly more 'unhealthy' saturated lipids than women free from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that they had significantly less healthy lipids attached with omega fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Legido-Quigley added: 'Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet—through fatty fish or via supplements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Asger Wretlind, dementia expert from and study co-author from King's College London said: 'Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The results are very striking and now we are looking at how early in life this change occurs in women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures show currently two in three people living with dementia in the UK are women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists analysed lipids in the blood and found there was a significant difference in omega fatty acids between healthy women and Alzheimer's patients &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst experts say this could be a result of women living longer, or other risk factors such as social isolation, education or hormonal changes as a result of the menopause, the findings suggest that lifestyle changes could play a crucial role in the development of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's UK, said: 'While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet could have a role.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity, which is funding the work, is also calling for further research to focus on a more ethnically diverse population to see whether the same effect is seen across a wider sample size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dudley added: 'Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's society estimates the overall annual cost of dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population could see these costs soar to £90billion in the next 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These animals have dealt with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-15000225/Frankenstein-rabbits-tentacles-colorado-minnesota-nebraska.html"&gt;similar sores and growths&lt;/a&gt; on their bodies as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition spreading through deer this summer is part of the same broad family of viruses that can affect humans, known as papillomaviruses, which target the skin and mucous membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, papillomaviruses cause conditions like common warts, plantar warts, and genital warts, and some strains are linked to cancers such as cervical or throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While both deer and human papillomaviruses lead to growths by infecting skin cells, the deer version is species-specific, meaning it's adapted only to infect deer and cannot jump to humans or other animals due to differences in how the virus attaches itself and enters cells in different species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts can be small, like a pea, or grow as big as a football, appearing gray, black, or fleshy and often hairless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While disease-transmitting insects are believed to be the main culprit spreading the virus, direct contact with the warts may also infect deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kristin Mansfield, a wildlife veterinarian in Washington state, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/lumps-growths-washington-deer"&gt;FOX13&lt;/a&gt; that deer can spread the virus if they share the same feeding areas, sleeping spot, or rubbing posts - usually a tree males use to mark their territory during mating season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts are found across the entire range of white-tailed deer in North America, so they're common throughout the US, with no specific state being much more affected than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A video of a rabbit with Shope papilloma virus (pictured here) captivated viewers online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One person on X posted an image of a deer covered in facial warts in their yard on August 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The warts can grow all over a deer's body, face, and legs.

The deer's immune system fights off the virus, and the warts shrink and disappear on their own after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, if the warts grow too large or become infected with bacteria, they can cause problems like blocking a deer's vision or ability to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One medical expert told the Daily Mail that Americans should expect diseases like this to continue spreading as temperatures get warmer throughout more of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Omer Awan of the University of Maryland School of Medicine explained that climate change has allowed mosquitoes and ticks to live longer and also spread to areas they don't normally inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On August 7, a Reddit user captured an image of a white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania with a large deer wart on its side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late June, a Reddit users photographed a young deer with its face completely covered in warts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While deer can't spread deer warts to people, they can bring illnesses such as Lyme disease to populated areas, which is passed on to humans through the ticks they carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late July, a resident in Western New York preparing for hunting season captured video of an infected deer walking through the woods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The condition is believed to be spreading across the US this summer as more disease-carrying insects breed in the hotter climate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts are not a new condition afflicting wildlife. Scientists believe it has been around for centuries, and studies on papillomaviruses affecting wildlife in the US go back to the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While climate changes in recent years are helping the virus to spread, Dr Awan noted that there's one other factor contributing to the increase in deer wart sightings: social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this,' the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new and improved model for estimating the risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/leading-cardiologists-reveal-new-heart-disease-risk-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emerged in November 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the calculator won raves for drawing on a larger, more contemporary, and more diverse population of Americans than its predecessors. But along with the praise came &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/10/cardiovascular-disease-statins-aha-guidelines/"&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/29/cardiovascular-risk-model-statins-heart-attacks/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that 40% of U.S. adults might no longer qualify for statins, the widely prescribed pills that fight artery-clogging cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those forecasts acknowledged that the second shoe had yet to drop. Equations come first, to estimate who’s at risk, but thresholds are the next step needed to establish when they might benefit from treatment. The new research concludes that a revised threshold for prescribing based on the improved risk calculator would mean roughly the same number of people qualify for a statin as before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s an important decision when cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, continues to lead all causes of death. And within that ranking, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease tops the list for causing preventable deaths and disease in American men and women. Determining a threshold that balances benefit with risk is why medical organizations have yet to issue guidelines based on the new equations. Under the existing recommendations, far fewer people who could benefit from statins actually take them now. Many who start taking them stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2725?guestAccessKey=fb1fb899-b4e3-48b6-9561-852356054e59&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=082025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research letter published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; reveals what different thresholds would look like based on the &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PREVENT&lt;/a&gt; model, short for Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTs, which also takes into account chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic conditions people might have along with less-than-ideal heart health. The older Pooled Cohort Equations model, issued in 2013 and derived from less extensive data, advised statins for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event was 7.5% over 10 years. When the PREVENT model was applied using that 7.5% threshold, many fewer adults were deemed eligible for a statin. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new analysis using PREVENT data calculated lowering that threshold to three different levels: a 3%, 4%, or 5% risk of a heart attack or stroke over 10 years. Settling the threshold for treatment at a 3% risk over 10 years would mean roughly the same number of people would qualify for a statin as do now. That lower 3% reflects the more robust data that PREVENT provides, study co-author Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist and epidemiologist at Northwestern University who worked to develop PREVENT, told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the older model encouraged a discussion between doctor and patient if the 10-year risk for a heart attack or stroke was 5%, and there was also an understanding back in 2013 that patients could benefit from statins if &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24222016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;their 10-year risk was as low as a 3%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statins are not without risks. Some people who take them have muscle pain, but a more pressing side effect is elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Data from cholesterol treatment trials have consistently shown that over about a 10-year period, 3% of people taking statins might develop diabetes. That’s more likely in people whose blood glucose levels are closing in on the criteria for a diabetes diagnosis, Khan said. But those same people with prediabetes are also at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, raising the question of whether the benefit from taking a statin might be greater than the risk of diabetes.&lt;strong&gt;   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lowering the threshold from 7.5% was expected, in line with a trend toward a lower bar for treatment. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821542" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA viewpoint last year&lt;/a&gt;, Khan and colleagues said as risk prediction tools evolve with the evidence for preventive treatments, lower-risk patients than before become candidates for drug therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gregg Fonarow, a cardiologist and professor of cardiovascular medicine and science at UCLA, took it a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefit of statins exceeds risk down to a 2.5% risk over 10 years, or perhaps even lower, he said, citing reanalyses of clinical trials. He was not involved in the research letter appearing in JAMA Cardiology. The lower the risk threshold being applied, he said, the larger the number of events that would be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This new analysis provides the number of individuals in the U.S. that would be eligible for statin treatment at different risk thresholds,” he told STAT in an email. “This information will be very helpful in reformulating guidelines and efforts to reduce preventable cardiovascular events.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A guideline from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology is expected in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping the number of people who might benefit the same as before, if the AHA/ACC adopt the threshold, was not the intent of the researchers, co-author Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we wanted to do here was really show what is the risk crosswalk like if you have a PREVENT score of 3% or 4% or 5%, how does that compare to the old risk threshold of 7.5% with the less accurate tool, and just try to put some data behind what does that look like in the U.S. population,” she said. “Because the PREVENT equations use more contemporary data, the risk estimate that we get is lower than the Pooled Cohort Equations. And I think we were really interested in making sure that we right-size the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PCE calculator has long been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/22/cholesterol-statin-guidelines/"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2016.02.055?articleID=2517904#tab1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;overestimating risk&lt;/a&gt;, but it was more advanced than using just LDL (the “bad”) cholesterol numbers to decide who might be a candidate for a statin. Since statins were introduced in the 1980s, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that when statins are combined with lifestyle modification, they can lower this risk of events by 25 to 40%. And they cost as little as $40 a year.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Sussman, a primary care physician at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, expressed concern that a threshold as low as 3% over 10 years might lead to more diabetes caused than heart attacks prevented. He did not participate in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do not necessarily want everyone on them. We want the right people on them,” he told STAT about statins. “That said, these are wonder drugs. The right number is a pretty large number. There are a lot of Americans who would benefit. And so what we want to do is find the threshold where the benefit is just about worth it. And that’s an inherently hard and inherently subjective question.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khan said the idea behind the risk estimation is to make sure the right people are getting a statin, independent of how many are getting a statin now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is it’s just the math and making sure that we understand the risk and define who is eligible for statins based on who’s going to benefit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khan, Fonarow, and Sussman see the eventual guideline as part of conversations between doctor and patient that take individual needs and wishes into account.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are some circumstances for which the answer is obvious: The person who had a heart attack should be on a statin,” Sussman said. “At a certain point, what is a benefit that’s real but so small it’s not worth it? It’s a combination of complex science, but also subjective human values.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For parents of school-aged children, the fall to-do list can seem ever-growing. Buy school supplies. Fill out endless school forms. Block off parent-teacher nights. Do the kids’ tennis shoes still fit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, at some point, you might remember flu shots. Get your flu shot. Get &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; flu shots. Or should you? Can you? Is that still a thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid political chatter about vaccines and the government entities that oversee them, it’s understandable to wonder where all this leaves the 2025-26 flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: Yes, the flu shot is still a thing. And doctors we spoke to said they recommend you get your flu shot this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some answers to common questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I heard the Trump administration could be changing vaccine recommendations. Does that apply to the flu vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no substantial changes to the federal government’s flu vaccine recommendation: The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says&lt;/a&gt; that people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;6 months old&lt;/a&gt; and up should get an annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means most insurers will cover it, and it should soon be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has opposed vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/116880" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;agreed that most people should get the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. He followed a recommendation from the board that advises the federal government on vaccine policy; Kennedy replaced the members with his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel voted against recommending multidose flu shots that contained the preservative thimerosal, but the preservative had &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/26/thimerosal-vaccines-flu-shot-RFK-mercury/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;already been removed&lt;/a&gt; from most vaccines, including most flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Who should not get the flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors acknowledged there are always exceptions to broad guidance. For example, people with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/egg-allergies.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;severe allergies&lt;/a&gt; to flu vaccine components should not get vaccines that contain those components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should discuss your health situation with your physician for personalized guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this season’s flu shot different from last season’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The flu shot was updated for the upcoming flu season, but the changes &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/understand-the-2025-2026-flu-vaccine-composition-recommendations" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;weren’t drastic&lt;/a&gt;. Like last year’s flu shot, this year’s vaccine is known as a three-component or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-types/trivalent.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;trivalent vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that protects against three influenza viruses — two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season’s vaccine was altered to target a specific strain of the influenza A/H3N2 virus expected to circulate this season, said Ryan Maves, a professor of medicine at Wake Forest University and a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Those &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;changes align&lt;/a&gt; with what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: When is the best time to get vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September, October, or early November. This allows your body time &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-definitely-need-to-get-a-flu-shot-this-year" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;to build up&lt;/a&gt; its protective antibodies as flu season begins and ensures your protection doesn’t wane before it ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., influenza infection typically peaks in February, so you want to make sure you’re vaccinated and your protection is still strong through February and into March, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this season’s flu vaccine guaranteed to protect against the influenza strain that’s circulating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guarantee all protection? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce risk of death? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, flu vaccines are best at “protecting us from the most severe consequences of influenza,” Schaffner said. That means the flu vaccine is most effective at keeping people out of the hospital or the intensive care unit and keeping people from dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A flu vaccine may not guarantee perfect protection against the flu, but skipping your flu shot simply guarantees you’ll have no protection at all,” said Benjamin Lee, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will the flu shot be readily available this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA passed its formula recommendations to vaccine manufacturers March 13 — early enough that the agency expected there would be “ &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;an adequate and diverse supply&lt;/a&gt;.” The people and places that administer flu shots should have them soon, typically beginning in September, said Flor Muñoz, a Baylor College of Medicine associate professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I heard Kennedy canceled &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$500 million in funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;for vaccine development. Could this affect future flu vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Kennedy announced the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cancellation of funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine development. Some companies have been &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-covid-combination-shot-moderna-vaccine-c627a5db5ad784335268ee6dbcb5e600" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;researching combined mRNA flu and COVID&lt;/a&gt; shots, but there are currently no approved mRNA flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts said the federal government’s changes — funding cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/18/rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-panel-replacements/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;vaccine committee purges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/health/fda-flu-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;deviations&lt;/a&gt; from existing procedures — are increasing uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My neighbour  Sarah and I met for coffee after a decade apart. She's 68. She walked in looking maybe 48—that particular glow that comes from health, not highlighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's not what I do," she said, stirring her coffee. "It's what I don't do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentiment echoes through conversations with those who seem to have negotiated a better deal with time. They haven't discovered magical serums or revolutionary treatments. Instead, they've identified the everyday habits that accelerate aging and quietly eliminated them from their lives. These aren't dramatic lifestyle overhauls—they're small subtractions that compound into visible differences over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They skip the sugar marathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look youngest in their sixties treat sugar like a sometimes food, not a constant companion. This isn't about never eating dessert—it's about breaking the modern pattern of sugar at every meal, in every drink, hidden in every sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Glycation&lt;/a&gt; is what happens when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin, creating compounds that make collagen stiff and inflexible. Think of it as caramelizing your skin from the inside—except instead of creating a delicious crust, you're creating wrinkles and sagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quietly young-looking among us read labels with the dedication of scholars. They know that pasta sauce doesn't need 12 grams of sugar, that "healthy" granola can pack more sugar than a candy bar. They've retrained their palates to find sweetness in actual fruit rather than fruit-flavored everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They don't worship the sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a particular type of person who spent the 1980s basting themselves in baby oil, chasing the perfect tan. Their skin now has that specific texture—like an expensive leather handbag that's been left in a hot car. Meanwhile, their sun-avoiding contemporaries could pass for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about vanity. &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/uv-radiation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UV damage&lt;/a&gt; accumulates like credit card debt—invisibly at first, then all at once. Every sunburn, every tan, every "just five more minutes" adds microscopic damage that emerges decades later as spots, wrinkles, and that telltale leathery texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking sixty-somethings weren't necessarily hiding indoors. They just made friends with shade, wore hats without irony, and discovered that SPF is less expensive than any anti-aging cream on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They refuse the cigarette invitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems obvious now, but remember: today's 60-year-olds came of age when smoking was sophisticated, when ads featured doctors recommending cigarettes, when you could smoke on airplanes. Those who resisted that cultural pressure, or quit early, gave their skin a gift that keeps giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking doesn't just cause &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;premature wrinkles&lt;/a&gt;—it fundamentally changes how your skin ages. It narrows blood vessels, reducing oxygen flow. It destroys collagen and elastin. It creates those vertical lip lines that no amount of lipstick can hide. The "smoker's face" that dermatologists describe isn't just about wrinkles; it's a whole constellation of changes that announce your habit decades after you've quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They don't diet dramatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eternally youthful sixty-somethings never did the grapefruit diet, the cabbage soup diet, or any plan that treated entire food groups like the enemy. They understood early what research now confirms: dramatic weight fluctuations age your face faster than a few stable extra pounds ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid weight loss doesn't give skin time to adjust. When the weight returns (and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/yo-yo-dieting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;95% of the time&lt;/a&gt;, it does), skin stretches again. This accordion effect breaks down elastic fibers, creating the kind of sagging that makes people say "you look tired" when you're not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who look youngest maintained relatively stable weights throughout their lives. They ate actual meals instead of replacing them with shakes. They understood that sustainable beats dramatic every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They skip the midnight marathons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their peers wore sleep deprivation like a badge of honor—pulling all-nighters for work, staying out until 4 AM, wearing "I'll sleep when I'm dead" t-shirts—the young-looking ones were home by 11, in bed by midnight, treating sleep like the biological necessity it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation doesn't just create dark circles. It triggers a cascade of hormonal changes that accelerate aging at the cellular level. Cortisol rises, breaking down collagen. Growth hormone drops, slowing skin repair. The result isn't just looking tired—it's looking older, faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-preserved sixty-somethings protected their sleep with the ferocity of new parents. They said no to the third drink, the late meeting, the Netflix binge. They understood that beauty sleep isn't a luxury—it's maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They don't stress professionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a subset of sixty-somethings who chased every promotion, answered every email within minutes, treated their careers like a competitive sport. You can see it in their faces—the permanent furrow between their brows, the tight jaw, the stress-aged skin that looks like it's been marinated in cortisol for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/body" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; literally shortens your telomeres—the protective caps on your chromosomes that determine how quickly you age. It shows up as inflammation, which manifests as puffiness, redness, and premature aging. The body keeps score, and stress always collects its debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones learned to compartmentalize. They left work at work. They understood that no email is so urgent it can't wait until morning, that success without sustainability is just delayed failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They avoid the beige food diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk through any grocery store and notice how much of our food has been processed into uniform beige—crackers, cookies, chips, bread, pasta. The sixty-somethings who look youngest made friends with color early—the deep reds of berries, the dark greens of leafy vegetables, the bright oranges of sweet potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These colors aren't just pretty—they're &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; in edible form. They fight the free radicals that break down collagen, cause inflammation, and accelerate aging. Every colorful meal is a small investment in your future face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones didn't become health food zealots. They just noticed that real food doesn't have ingredients lists, that things that grow from the ground tend to help you age more slowly than things made in factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They don't become their couch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixty-somethings who could pass for forty-five never let convenience eliminate all effort from their lives. They're not gym obsessives or marathon runners. They just kept moving—taking stairs, walking to the store, dancing in their kitchens while cooking dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedentary living ages you inside-out. It slows the circulation that delivers oxygen to your skin. It shrinks the muscles that hold everything up. Eventually, gravity wins by default, creating that characteristic sag that no cream can lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement doesn't have to mean exercise. The best-preserved sixty-somethings simply refused to let convenience eliminate all physical effort from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They skip the anger addiction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people collect grievances like stamps, nurturing old wounds, rehearsing arguments from 1987. You can see it in their faces—the permanent scowl lines, the tight mouth, the way their default expression looks like they're perpetually smelling something unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic anger triggers the same stress hormones as any other chronic stress, with the added bonus of creating specific facial patterns that become permanent over time. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/forgiveness/art-20047692" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out, is a beauty treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones learned to let things go—not for others, but for themselves. They understood that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to age faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. They don't chase youth desperately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the sixty-somethings who look youngest aren't the ones desperately trying to look young. They're not getting excessive procedures, wearing teenage fashion, or pretending decades haven't passed. They've accepted their age while refusing to accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something aging about the desperate pursuit of youth—the too-tight face from excessive procedures, the inappropriate clothing that highlights rather than hides aging, the exhausting effort of pretending. Authenticity, surprisingly, is more youthful than any attempt at reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking young at sixty isn't about discovering secrets—it's about avoiding the obvious mistakes we've normalized. The people who seem to age in slow motion haven't found the fountain of youth; they've simply noticed which everyday habits are fountains of aging and walked past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is moral judgment. There's beauty and value in every face, regardless of how many years it shows. But for those curious about the gap between chronological and visible age, the answer rarely involves expensive interventions. More often, it's about what you didn't do—the sugar you didn't eat, the sun you didn't worship, the stress you didn't nurture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real insight might be this: we spend fortunes on products to reverse aging while actively participating in habits that accelerate it. It's like pressing the gas and brake simultaneously, then wondering why the journey feels so rough. Sometimes the most powerful anti-aging strategy is simply lifting your foot off the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health has been notified of a confirmed case of measles at Dulles International Airport on Aug. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is from another state, the VDH said in a Tuesday news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed below is the date, time and location of the potential exposure site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dulles International Airport (IAD) on Tuesday, Aug. 12: in the main terminal, at the TSA security checkpoint, in Concourse B, and on transportation from the main terminal to Concourse B between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential exposure is &lt;a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/vdh-investigates-another-measles-exposure-in-northern-virginia/article_82001cde-6408-4dcd-b8a9-5fa9711d0133.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one of several&lt;/a&gt; involving travelers through Virginia this year. The state has also seen &lt;a href="https://www.insidenova.com/culpeper/virginias-third-measles-case-of-the-year-reported-in-charlottesville-area/article_14954e5c-9bb4-457e-b8dd-c372e2b9ddea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;three confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; among Virginia residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes, according to the VDH. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest information on measles cases and exposures in Virginia, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;VDH Measles website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request your vaccination records using the VDH Immunization Record Request Form. Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can email &lt;a href="mailto:epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov"&gt;epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov&lt;/a&gt; or contact your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;

KENNEDY JR. was named secretary of health and human services, a certain kind of voter was thrilled. Some were Democrats, some were Republicans, and others were independents, but they were united in their belief that the nation was beset by a health disaster that could be laid at the feet of the government and experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Calley Means, a former Republican lobbyist and now an official at the Department of Health and Human Services (and the brother of surgeon general nominee Casey Means), spoke for this constituency when he explained that he supported Kennedy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/15/nx-s1-5191947/trump-rfk-health-hhs" rel&gt;because&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “The public health–expert class has given us a public health collapse. We are on the verge of, at best, a health crisis and, at worst, a societal collapse with 20 percent of GDP going to health expenditures. [We’re] getting sicker, fatter, more depressed, more infertile for every dollar we spend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fomenting suspicion about vaccines and food additives while pushing miracle diets (Kennedy’s includes no candy but plenty of fast food, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/robert-f-kennedy-jr-candy-snap-confectioners-association-lobbying-junk-food-health-hhs" rel&gt;Joe Perticone points out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) has made many an influencer wealthy and famous. Heck, it made one a cabinet secretary. Though these obsessives have always been with us, the Trump moment has given them new power because their conspiracy-mindedness fits seamlessly into the MAGA analysis of the world: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are not responsible for anything that has gone awry in your life. It’s the work of sinister elites who’ve betrayed you. They’ve shipped your job overseas, halved your neighbor’s salary through bad trade deals, stolen elections, and picked your pocket to support failed forever wars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; In that spirit, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" rel&gt;notions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that vaccines cause autism, that antidepressants cause school shootings, and that COVID-19 spares Jews and Asians seem to demand a fair hearing. It’s a “Burn the Witches” level of analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the early days of Trump 2.0, even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/31/maha-make-america-healthy-again-trump-rfk-jr/" rel&gt;reasonable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; adults who should know better told reporters that it might be good to have Kennedy as our chief public health officer because, after all, we do have a serious problem with chronic health conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. GOP senators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-supports-rfk-jr-for-hhs-secretary" rel&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-marshall-releases-statement-after-voting-to-confirm-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/" rel&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on chronic diseases and predicted that he would bring a “fresh perspective” to health care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that most of what causes chronic medical conditions in America is almost entirely outside the remit of government. Obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, drinking, and poor diet all contribute mightily to chronic poor health—and they are behaviors that are extremely difficult to change. By contrast, government is indispensable in certain crucial areas—prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, promoting research on new drugs, and funding scientific studies on best practices. In all of those, Kennedy is not only failing to do his job well; he is doing the exact opposite of what he should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It isn’t popular for politicians or activists to acknowledge, but most chronic conditions that afflict Americans are the result of personal choices. Please don’t get me wrong: People get cancer and Parkinson’s and ALS and lots of other ailments due to simple bad luck. But chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are closely linked to behavior. It’s possible to do everything right and still get these diseases, but it’s much more common for people who have unhealthy habits to succumb. Even cancer rates can be affected by eating habits: consuming lots of fruits and vegetables has been shown to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7173711/" rel&gt;protective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/topics/fruit-vegetables-and-cancer/" rel&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; forms of cancer. Again, this is not to blame people for their diseases or to suggest in any way that they don’t deserve treatment and care. Neither is it to suggest that what people eat is entirely a function of what they choose, as opposed to what is available to them at an affordable price. But as a matter of epidemiology, it’s important to be clear-eyed about what we can control and what we can’t. There are plenty of wealthy Americans who could easily make healthier choices and don’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who are obese have a 28 percent higher risk of heart disease than do people of normal weight. Carrying excessive extra pounds also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/being-overweight-or-obese-is-linked-with-heart-disease-even-without-other-metabolic-risk-factors/" rel&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; cancer rates, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2621047/" rel&gt;stillbirths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, preeclampsia,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks" rel&gt; strokes, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, infertility, gout, and mental health challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for most of every day also does not conduce to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We Americans (and, to be fair, many people around the globe) do a lot of that. A British &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28645071/" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that adults who watch six or more hours of TV a day had twice the all-cause mortality of those who watched two hours or less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone knows that the best path to good health is eating healthy foods, getting a decent amount of exercise, avoiding cigarettes, drinking alcohol in small amounts (no more than 1 drink per day for women, 2 for men), and maintaining a healthy body weight. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032047?dom=newscred&amp;amp;src=syn" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that women who followed these recommendations lived an average of 14 years longer than those who did not, and men lived an extra 12. But take a guess at how many American adults actually follow all five of those recommendations? According to a University of Oregon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/content-hub/more-than-97-of-americans-dont-follow-a-healthy-lifestyle#:~:text=The%20study%2C%20conducted%20by%20Oregon%20State%20University,healthy%2C%20don%27t%20smoke%20and%20get%20regular%20exercise." rel&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, only 2.7 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, yes, we are plagued by diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and cancer. But it’s not because we use food dyes (though by all means, remove food dyes, we don’t need them), or because drug companies have conspired to keep us sick, or because &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/jul/10/rfk-jrs-wi-fi-claim-about-human-blood-brain-barrie/" rel&gt;WiFi is frying our brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or due to fluoride in water (though in some jurisdictions, levels may&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/fluoride-water-kennedy-rfk-brain-development/" rel&gt; be a bit too high&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). The only way to grapple with these conditions is to change our behavior—and that’s hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, what is not hard, or shouldn’t be, is to hire a government that does the basics of public health, like empanel experts to advise on the composition of the yearly flu vaccine, or provide guidance on which vaccines are needed for children and at what ages, or fund research on vaccines to prevent future pandemics. On all of these fronts, Kennedy has done the opposite, disbanding &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/uspstf-rfk-jr-meeting-canceled-preventive-care/" rel&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; committees of academics and physicians, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" rel&gt;canceling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; funding for mRNA vaccine research, changing the recommendation for COVID vaccines for pregnant women and babies, and creating a panel stacked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/08/19/opinion/vaccines-autism-evidence.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fU8.V0tv.bA8BHK74N7I7&amp;amp;smid=url-share" rel&gt;frauds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to “reexamine” the non-existent link between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take this to the bank: Kennedy’s crusade will not overcome our chronic disease problem. But it is very probable, if he is not stopped, that former plagues like measles will make a big comeback; that we will be far less prepared to cope with the next epidemic because we cut research on the miracle of mRNA technology; that rates of vaccine hesitancy will continue to rise; and that trust in government professionalism will be shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-cant-fix-americas-healthand?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-cant-fix-americas-healthand?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:54:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE94QjhRa1p0THBvVmtTZkJObmhpQ0NqRGEwUHE2V0FkWENHY1hYajhWZjlsWGs3Sk9LZ0FsWVRiVkpVUkszNmxwZF9zWWhSTzJwX042eWUtZHdDa1dCWElvTjJuSTFVUktIX2RTRjRXVHI</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，胆固醇不仅仅与心脏健康有关-它可能是阿尔茨海默氏症的缺失环节- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9LODFjeHNWTUFTam9SWk10WWNyUTg3NmJzR3ZLVV94YW4xUU1lb2tCOXZtMEM3VVlUN3Z0ODNnU0JQOF9MNmJJV2lfbUxZb0haRE1nekh5TFhjc0w5ZnEtWWZzcVVPY1AtbWhiRUZNLWo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The Link Between Cholesterol And Alzheimer's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;akinbostanci - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study suggests that there's a link between how well you move cholesterol to the neurons in your brain and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64864696/creatine-alzheimers-disease-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This factor is connected to the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:APOE4;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;APOE4&lt;/a&gt; genetic variant, which significantly increases your risk of developing the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's what to know and what this means for Alzheimer's research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease sparks a cascade of changes throughout the body that lead to a slew of debilitating &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65333676/early-warning-signs-alzheimers-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one surprising biological change that researchers are just starting to uncover, thanks to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022227525001270" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Lipid Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience a breakdown in the ability to shuttle cholesterol to the neurons in their brain, and that this symptom is linked to a certain genetic variant called APOE4, which carries a known risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological discovery could potentially pave the way for a better understanding of the disease and even future disease prevention methods. Here’s what you need to know about the science so far, with input from a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (the biological liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord) from 10 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 people who did not have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that lipoproteins (round particles made of fat and protein) in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients were less effective at delivering cholesterol to neurons, or nerve cells, which are responsible for transmitting information from the brain throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is an essential, waxy, fat-like molecule that your body needs for good health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NHLBI). Cholesterol is carried around your body by two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. HDL or “good” cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can cause a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque in your arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health complications, per the NHLBI. But high levels of good HDL cholesterol may lower the risk for certain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has a bad rap in the health world, cholesterol is actually really important for your proper brain function. Your brain is the most &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:-rich organ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;-rich organ&lt;/a&gt; in your body. Specifically, cholesterol helps make up cell membranes, including those in nerve cells, and plays a crucial role in your neurons' ability to "talk" to each other and transmit information. When cholesterol levels are out of balance, it can impact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs12276-024-01273-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65821905%2Fcholesterol-alzheimers-link-apoe4-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:transmission of essential information;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;transmission of essential information&lt;/a&gt; between nerve cells, leading to cognitive issues that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Cholesterol is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/165/4/bqae032/7631422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:building block;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;building block&lt;/a&gt; for steroid hormones, which support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't mean more cholesterol is always good for your brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol are usually considered a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, or “clogged pipes” in the brain, explains Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is less research and understanding on the possible benefits of cholesterol found in spinal fluid including HDL, which we classically identify as the ‘good cholesterol,’” Dr. Segil says. “We know high levels of certain types of cholesterol cause strokes and we are less clear in the year 2025 about the benefits of cholesterol in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this link back to Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study noted that cholesterol found in lipoproteins were different in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but Dr. Segil says that there is a “complicated” relationship between lipids and protein in the brain. “Some researchers continue to assign memory loss symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s due to abnormal brain protein levels and this paper noted lipid brain levels may also be abnormal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Segil points out that neurologists commonly prescribe medications called statins to lower levels of cholesterol and the risk of stroke. Lowering levels of LDL cholesterol can decrease the risk of developing certain type of dementia, including vascular dementia, he says. But it’s not clear if it may do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research will determine if lowering your cholesterol will result in lower chances of getting Alzheimer’s dementia,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:22:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9LODFjeHNWTUFTam9SWk10WWNyUTg3NmJzR3ZLVV94YW4xUU1lb2tCOXZtMEM3VVlUN3Z0ODNnU0JQOF9MNmJJV2lfbUxZb0haRE1nekh5TFhjc0w5ZnEtWWZzcVVPY1AtbWhiRUZNLWo</guid></item><item><title>可能对您的健康有害的5种食品添加剂—以及如何避免它们-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWmlJaXFPWDUzT0FRd0V0Q0ROV1FYOWpkeWFRY0d0ODhpWWlHRWxoaTRPVnF4VS1TOU1fUHk5SzdFSTMzTlBrYmxFdkRRYkZQWS1VeUxzU2pqdHJCTWlaMkhHYUhIX3cwUWxCOEFkUkl4TVhtREFwVjk1alBmOXFfVUZqS1NGbHJhczlsZkdWR2I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GEMFEBYZBF3ZEPL6256K5Y7TI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A striking &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/07/ultra-processed-foods-cdc-data/" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the federal government this month found that Americans on average get about half their calories from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/07/healthier-ultra-processed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; that have been linked in studies to increased rates of obesity and chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCZ3YHUJ3NF3ZAAL5H6E6ICJCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One reason ultra-processed foods might be so hazardous to your health is that they’re often loaded with chemical additives, such as synthetic emulsifiers, preservatives and sugar substitutes.

But according to OB-GYN, surgeon and co-host of the &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/" target="_blank"&gt;She MD podcast&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Thais Aliabadi, there are numerous other tests that women should also be receiving to better understand their health and prevent possibly life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39e61d" class="body-graf"&gt;The questions you should be asking at the doctor depend on your stage of life, Aliabadi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dfd82c" class="body-graf"&gt;For example, if a teenage girl is struggling with painful or irregular periods, Aliabadi wants her to know that’s not normal and that she should be screened for endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For women of reproductive age interested in knowing more about their fertility, it’s possible to find out your egg count. And if you’re approaching menopause and losing sleep, gaining weight or experiencing other changes, you should bring these up at your check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53d56f" class="body-graf"&gt;Unfortunately, many OB-GYNs don’t prioritize gathering as much information as they can about patients because they have limited time per patient, Aliabadi says. That’s why it’s important for women to be their own advocates when it comes to their symptoms and important health screenings, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc2606" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s her checklist to take to your next well woman visit, depending on your stage of life. And many of these, if not all, will be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-aaeac4" class="body-heading"&gt;Teens to 40s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee046f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-d743e1" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast imaging (mammogram, ultrasound and MRI, depending on your risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic exam and ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pap smear and HPV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexually transmitted infections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screening for underlying health conditions (PCOS, endometriosis, insulin resistance, thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune disorders)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health screenings for conditions including anxiety, depression and eating disorders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast cancer risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing if there is a family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg count test (AMH)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone panel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee37fe" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44ff50" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCOS: &lt;/strong&gt;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition where the ovaries make higher-than-normal levels of androgens, or male-type hormones. This can interfere with ovulation and raise the risk of infertility, diabetes and heart disease. Common signs include irregular or missed periods, excess hair growth, acne and weight changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bedbdf" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a single test for PCOS, and diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, blood tests to check hormone levels, and an ultrasound to look at the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3037cb" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endometriosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Endometriosis affects 10% of women and is one of the top causes of infertility, according to Aliabadi. It is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of it. Common signs include very painful periods, pain with sex, and bowel or bladder pain during menstruation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02bd23" class="body-graf"&gt;Many women face years of delays before getting a diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, imaging such as ultrasound or MRI, and sometimes laparoscopy, a minor surgery that allows doctors to look inside the pelvis directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8de81" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;Aliabadi wants every woman to know her lifetime risk of breast cancer by age 30, using tools like &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/risk-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Calculator&lt;/a&gt;. For most women, breast imaging should start at age 40, but if there’s a family history, start 10 years before your youngest affected relative’s diagnosis. Women at high risk — 20% or more in their lifetime — may need to begin screening as early as age 30, and women with genetic mutations may need to start as early as 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24714b" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is especially important for women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, since results can guide when and how screening begins. Women with dense breasts or a high lifetime risk of breast cancer benefit from extra imaging such as ultrasound or MRI (in addition to mammograms). Aliabadi also recommends 3D mammography for women with dense breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4790e4" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure you are up to date on important vaccines, such as HPV, COVID, Tdap, as well as the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a79790" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and Menopause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-75b75f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-8ac13f" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mammogram and other indicated breast imaging (ultrasound or MRI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone testing, especially if experiencing menopause symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colonoscopy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone density test (DXA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart health: full lipid panel including APOB and lipoprotein (a), hs-CRP (inflammation marker), fasting glucose, HbA1c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia markers, such as Apoe4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic health markers, such as blood sugar, thyroid and vitamin levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing, if there’s a new family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-2023f4" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f6b83" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and menopause symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;These can include hair loss, hot flashes, sleep problems, vaginal dryness, painful sex, mood swings, brain fog and weight gain, especially in the abdomen. The good news is many of these are treatable, Aliabadi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d527ed" class="body-graf"&gt;If you experience any of these, you don’t need to “tough it out,” she adds. Bring them up with your doctor. Depending on your symptoms and health history, your doctor may order tests such as estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, thyroid function, vitamin D, cholesterol and HbA1c. Based on results, treatment options may include hormone therapy, non-hormonal medications or local vaginal estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86eb14" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Older women should be up to date on flu, Tdap, shingles, pneumonia and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d00b93" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf4c3" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Aliabadi wants women to know that they don’t need to muscle through uncomfortable symptoms, whether it’s painful periods as a teen or hot flashes later in life. And it’s important to be proactive about hormone health before perimenopause, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1562b0" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re interested in having children, you should seek info about your fertility potential, and it’s key to start healthy habits before perimenopause to protect bone and heart health. These include eating a balanced diet of mostly whole foods and regular exercise, especially strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59812d" class="body-graf"&gt;“A woman’s exam should never be just a Pap smear, a pelvic exam, or a breast check. It needs to be a comprehensive look at her whole health, from conditions like PCOS and endometriosis that affect fertility, to awareness of perimenopause symptoms, heart and bone health, and everything in between,” Aliabadi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e117b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goal is not only to treat problems as they arise, but to anticipate risks, protect long-term health and empower women to thrive at every stage of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4bcd5d" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For more information about women’s health from Aliabadi, visit &lt;a href="http://shemd.com" target="_blank"&gt;SheMD.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNQWNFeW5vdmE3dllLeW1Md1ZqM3dEMy0zTUNmdG5yWFRDaDlnLTdaT0U1bENfcVVBUXZuMTJPZEgybVVFTmJZQ2dTZXZxWkFTMzZfeXRMYXdELVM1d1IzUTg2MWZHZUZ6RFZ0YlNQMmxya01ya3M0ZE5UZ3lDVzhJaDRkaVpEQUHSAVRBVV95cUxPNUpiaVNCLU1lZzRod25RQ2FfZDdWbTVoR0hDQXlnQWpqb1dQcDJFaGNlUnZacFZaNmp5b3RmY1FHVDZhZ3RaMk42ZTdsQVRvSFotZG4</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬在两周后与父母团聚时的“机场快乐哭声” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRTJVU2ZBUDVSa2t4QklSdkZvWWlJUFhBYW5KcHlubkhzVHEtQzdpcjBYeGtoUkNhdXgyTjBmSDhHZ1dTVGd0S2wyNzBJZHg5MTM3dzJVU1lFWnJLeTJPU3JIZFQ1Y2dEem1DbFZNd2U3aDc0bU5SSjJ4UWFzVkNwMXJyVXl4b041N1NER1J3by1aSlhpekYzSw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-airport-happy-cries-while-reuniting-with-parents-after-2-weeks-are-everything" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever's 'Airport Happy Cries' While Reuniting With Parents After 2 Weeks Are Everything;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever's 'Airport Happy Cries' While Reuniting With Parents After 2 Weeks Are Everything&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any pet parent will tell you that leaving your beloved fur baby to go on vacation is just so tough.

A hiking path crosses the expanse of long grasses and berry bushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Hokit walks the path, he carries a handmade tool made out of plastic pipes taped together that hold a large rectangle of white flannel cloth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He jokes that this device is "sophisticated," but the scientific survey is quite serious: He's sweeping the cloth over the shrubs and grass, hoping that "questing" ticks will latch on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along the summer trail, ticks dangle from blades of grass, sticking their legs out and waiting for a passing mammal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We got one," Hokit says. "So that came off of this sedge grass right here… simply pick them off with our fingers. We've got a vial that we pop them in."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Any captured ticks will go back to Hokit's lab in Helena for identification. Most of them will likely be identified as Rocky Mountain wood ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Hokit also wants to find out if new species are making their way into the state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As human-driven climate change makes winters shorter, ticks are spending less time hibernating and have more active months when they can hitch rides on animals and people. Sometimes the ticks carry themselves — and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; — to new parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit found &lt;a href="https://www.mtpr.org/2025-05-27/briefs-grizzly-bear-deaths-meat-processing-funds-deer-ticks-detected" target="_blank"&gt;deer ticks for the first time&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in northeastern Montana. Deer ticks are infamous for transmitting Lyme disease and can infect people with &lt;a href="https://www.ticklab.org/blog/2020/06/30/diseases-transmitted-by-blacklegged-deer-tick-bites/" target="_blank"&gt;other pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83651" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Hokit finds and identifies ticks alongside a trail outside Condon, Mont. These surveys help public health officials understand where ticks are in Montana and detect new species that have migrated on large mammals like deer. Hokit found deer ticks, which are known to carry Lyme disease, earlier this year in northeast Montana.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Knowing a new species like the deer tick has arrived in Montana or other states is important for doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr.&lt;a href="https://providers.billingsclinic.com/provider/tsun-sheng-n-ku/2068410" target="_blank"&gt; Neil Ku&lt;/a&gt; is an infectious disease specialist at Billings Clinic in eastern Montana. He says most patients don't come in right after they get bitten by a tick. They usually show up later, when they start feeling sick from a tick-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Fever, some chills, they may just feel bad, similar to many infections we may encounter throughout the year," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's rare that patients connect a tick bite to those symptoms and even more rare that they capture and keep the tick that bit them. Sorting out whether someone might have a tick-borne illness can be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Knowing what ticks are in the region will help doctors know that they might start encountering patients infected with new diseases after a tick bite, Ku says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's partially why the state is on the hunt for new tick species.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we know about what's in Montana, the better we can inform our physicians, the better care you can receive," said &lt;a href="https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/contact" target="_blank"&gt;Devon Cozart&lt;/a&gt;, a zoonotic illness and vector-borne disease epidemiologist with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cozart collects and tests the ticks from field surveys in Montana to see whether they are carrying any pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether a tick can get a human sick depends on the species, but the kind of mammal on which it feeds also plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Usually it's a rodent that might be carrying, for example, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. So, the tick will feed on that rodent, then will get the pathogen as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the prevalence of a particular disease can vary in mammal populations, ticks in one part of the state could be more or less likely to get you sick. That's also important information for medical providers, says Cozart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This kind of surveillance and testing isn't happening in every state or county. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Vector-Assessment-2023-Sep.2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 500 health departments around the country found that roughly a quarter do some kind of tick surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not all&lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Local_EH_Department_Tick_Activities_Final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; are equal, says &lt;a href="https://virtualcommunities.naccho.org/thrivecommunitiesofpractice/people/chelsea-gridley-smith" target="_blank"&gt;Chelsea Gridley-Smith&lt;/a&gt;, director of environmental health at the National Association of City and County Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Field surveys can be expensive. For numerous local and state health departments, tick surveillance relies on a less expensive, more passive approach. Concerned patients, veterinarians and doctors must collect and send in ticks for identification.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It does provide a little information about what ticks are actually interacting with people and animals, but it doesn't get into the weeds of how common ticks are in that area and how often do those ticks carry pathogens," said Gridley-Smith.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says more health departments want to start tick surveillance, but getting funding is hard and might get harder as federal public health grants from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dry up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montana receives about $60,000 from a federal grant annually, but the bulk of that funding goes toward mosquito surveillance, which is more intensive and costly. What's left funds trips into the field to look for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit says he doesn't have enough funding for his small team to survey everywhere he would like to in a state as large as Montana. That means he's unable to monitor emerging populations of deer ticks as closely as he would like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He found those new deer ticks in two Montana counties, but he doesn't have enough data to determine whether they have begun reproducing there, establishing a local population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Hokit uses data on climate and vegetation to make predictions about where deer ticks might thrive in the state. He has his eye on particular areas of western Montana, like the Flathead Valley.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says that will help his team narrow down where to look next so they can let the public know when deer ticks — and the disease they can carry — arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

He marinated it in garlic vinegar and cooked it medium-rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To this day, he has not forgotten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I woke up at 2am with major stomach cramps and thought I had food poisoning,” said Keenan, 58. “I managed to go back to sleep but woke up four hours later and was covered in hives. I&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; sat up in bed and almost fainted just from sitting up, that’s how low my blood pressure was.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan had gone into &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/anaphylaxis-allergic-reaction-symptoms-what-to-do-b29qt9fnq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;. He quickly took an antihistamine, rushed to the local hospital and underwent a series of blood tests. Days later the cause of the mystery illness was confirmed: he had alpha-gal syndrome, a life-threatening allergy to red meats and most dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hundreds of people in Martha’s Vineyard, a large island south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, are living with this rare condition, which can be caused by a single bite from the lone star tick. It has transformed this exclusive, carefree summer spot into a place where residents practise veganism — not because they want to, but because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.3"&gt;&lt;div id="5203a86b-6caf-450a-9b83-c2571760308d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;An educational display used by Patrick Roden-Reynolds, a biologist who surveys tick populations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE/ELIZABETH CECIL/THE NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sufferers cannot eat any food products that contains alpha-gal, a sugar molecule carried by the lone star tick and which is present in all mammals — except humans and some monkeys. This means cheeses, milk and meats from beef to venison are all off the menu. For some, even white sugar cannot be tolerated because it is processed using animal-bone char.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Alpha-gal symptoms including hives, stomach cramps, vomiting and breathlessness often start to appear several hours after eating foods containing the molecule, giving the syndrome its nickname “the midnight allergy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/lyme-disease-symptoms-serena-williams-alexis-ohainan-dltvc9pcb" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyme disease: the ‘yuppie virus’ with dangerous false diagnoses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Such is the prevalence of the syndrome in Martha’s Vineyard that local restaurants and bakeries have introduced “alpha-gal-friendly” menu options, while grocery stores are selling more plant-based ice creams, cheeses and meats than ever before. Sufferers have set up an alpha-gal support group and regularly share advice on social media on how to avoid being bitten. Others have started to shun dining out, fearing they might fall ill from a slab of butter or a stray piece of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.9"&gt;&lt;div id="971c5b45-d60c-48c8-9b32-7e8676b6de1e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Alpha-gal-friendly foods at the North Tabor Farm Stand in Martha’s Vineyard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE/ELIZABETH CECIL/THE NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I’m on a Martha’s Vineyard Facebook group and it’s a constant conversation,” said Megan DeLisle, the general manager of the Black Dog restaurant in Edgartown. “People are talking about it all the time. They get a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/growth-of-tick-diseases-blamed-on-climate-change-and-rewilding-jsgfxrv60" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;tick bite&lt;/a&gt; and they’re scared, asking for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Her restaurant, she said, now offers an “alpha-gal entree” to cope with the demand, adding: “We’ll have local people come in and they’ll absolutely ask for alpha-gal entrees. No dairy, nothing with mammals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The lone star tick, an eight-legged arachnid no bigger than a shirt button, was first found on Martha’s Vineyard in 1985 but has become more established in recent years, feeding and breeding on the thousands of deer that roam the island’s lush woods and beach grass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is reflected in the rising number of alpha-gal diagnoses. Some 523 new cases were reported on Martha’s Vineyard last year out of 1,254 tests for the allergy, according to data from the island’s main hospital. In 2020, just two out of nine samples tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan, a telecoms repairman who thinks he first developed the syndrome after stepping in a cluster of ticks in 2019, was the second person on the island to be diagnosed with alpha-gal, he said. At that time, none of the local doctors knew what they were dealing with. He said: “They were taking pictures. I was a case study. But they’re pretty good now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But whenever he ventures off the island, nobody is aware of the condition. “I went to the mainland for some dental work and told the doctor what I had but he and no one in his office had ever heard of it. That’s seven miles away from where I’m sitting right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/363dd094-5a6d-418c-a2bc-c31bbbf34610" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climate change could trigger boom in tick population&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan said he used to feel faint from the fumes released by a BBQ. “I’m a little better now,” he adds. Even so, he said his symptoms — diarrhoea, cramps and itching — can last days at a time whenever he accidentally eats something he shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the most severe cases, anaphylactic shock can develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alpha-gal can be life-threatening for some,” said Patrick Roden-Reynolds, a biologist who leads the island’s &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-must-wake-up-to-the-serious-risks-of-lyme-disease-j8sf7n38r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;tick-safety&lt;/a&gt; programme. “Others may only get mild symptoms like hives. Reactions can be very different for different people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Kate Sudarsky, a 26-year-old teacher on the island, is one of the luckier ones. She was diagnosed with alpha-gal in 2021 after Keenan, her godfather, encouraged her to get checked for a mystery rash that had been bothering her for nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But since her diagnosis she has never had an anaphylactic reaction, nor does she suffer from breathlessness — although she still carries an EpiPen with her. She said hives and an upset stomach are the worst of her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The worst thing about the condition, she said, is how it’s reshaped her social life. She largely avoids BBQs and going out to dinner with friends because she cannot be sure that butter or white sugar hasn’t been used in the food she eats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.26"&gt;&lt;div id="0d9020fb-d7e1-4f0e-a0e6-51184c9178ac"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Diners in Martha’s Vineyard are increasingly wary of ingredients due to developing alpha-gal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It has had a huge impact on me,” she said. “I just can’t trust that a lot of places are able to accommodate my allergies. Or going over to somebody’s house for a potluck or a BBQ, you don’t want to be the social pariah asking people, ‘Is this vegan? What about that?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sudarsky said that she missed cheese the most, as well as being able to grab a slice of pizza with her friends. Vegan cheese, she added, “is not good in any regard”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although the prevalence of alpha-gal syndrome on Martha’s Vineyard has rocketed in recent years, the island is “definitely not the worst off”, said Roden-Reynolds. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that the Midwest has the highest rates per capita, and the agency estimates that about 450,000 people are living with the disease in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/a31df34e-67df-42f0-a6a0-b428ff641b27" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darrell Currie: Doctors treated me like a guinea pig, so I tried something new&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yet experts fear the situation on Martha’s Vineyard is only going to get worse due to the island’s growing &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/venison-deer-foodbanks-perthshire-jtsgr7xsr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;deer population&lt;/a&gt;. Roden-Reynolds said there are anywhere from 55 to 75 deer per square mile — up from 40 to 60 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is up to ten times the amount of deer needed for a healthy forest ecosystem, he said, adding: “Each deer this time of year probably has a couple of hundred ticks on them that are attached and feeding and producing new ticks for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Locals have called for an increase in deer hunting to manage the island’s population. “Even doing some sort of hunting tourism-promotion thing here would be helpful in a way,” said Sudarsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Others have said that more accurate labelling is needed for food and medicines to indicate whether it’s “alpha-gal friendly”. Keenan said he had been prescribed drugs in the past only to find out through the manufacturer’s website that it contained an inactive ingredient he could not consume. He said: “I’m not sure why the hospital’s pharmacist or the doctors can’t provide that information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While there is no treatment for alpha-gal, people’s allergic reactivity can wane over time, and some are able to successfully reintroduce dairy, red meat and other mammalian products into their diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That day has yet to come for Keenan.

And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire’s disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US’s largest city, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page"&gt;has sickened&lt;/a&gt; more than 100 people and killed &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/19/us-news/fifth-person-dies-in-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-harlem-as-cases-rise-to-108/"&gt;five&lt;/a&gt; in a growing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire’s, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Climate change is helping to make Legionnaire’s disease both more plentiful in the places where it already exists and creating the potential for it to move to new places where the population may not be accustomed to it. Cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where hotter weather meets older infrastructure, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/index.html"&gt;have reported more cases&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Recently, Legionella bacteria was &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/legionella-bacteria-found-water-system-dearborn-allegria-village/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in a nursing home’s water system in Dearborn, Michigan — one of the states, along with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/surv-reporting/2018-19-surv-report-508.pdf"&gt;Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, that have &lt;a href="https://www.msms.org/About-MSMS/News-Media/michigan-experiencing-increase-in-legionnaires-disease"&gt;seen more activity in the past few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Anyone can contract Legionnaire’s disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms — fever, headache, shortness of breath — appear within days. It can cause a severe lung infection, with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html#:~:text=Hospitalization%20is%20common.,fatality%20rate%20is%20extremely%20low."&gt;a death rate of around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While healthier people often experience few symptoms, the more vulnerable — young children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems — face serious danger from the illness. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire’s disease, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/06/legionnaires-disease-nyc-outbreak-ac/85531559007/"&gt;many of them&lt;/a&gt; living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s disease is a microcosm of climate change’s impact on low-income communities. As warmer temperatures facilitate the spread of disease, the most socially vulnerable populations are going to pay the steepest price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-collision-of-legionnaires-disease-climate-change-and-economic-disparities" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collision of Legionnaire’s disease, climate change, and economic disparities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s disease was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC358030/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; after an unusually aggressive pneumonia outbreak during an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere — in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn’t pose a threat to humans. &lt;em&gt;Usually. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal for Legionnaire’s to grow and spread. They’re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person’s lungs when they inhale. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/climate_and_microbial_iaq.pdf"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, 80 percent of Legionnaire’s cases are linked to potable water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Summers have always been prime time for the spread of Legionnaire’s, and climate change only exacerbates all of these problems. For starters, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31519664/"&gt;the quality of natural water is degrading&lt;/a&gt; — creating &lt;a href="https://www.iwcinnovations.com/blog/environmental-factors-contributing-to-legionella-growth/"&gt;more favorable conditions for Legionella&lt;/a&gt;, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply — as the planet warms. In the summer, the higher the temperatures and the more humid the air, the easier it is for the bacteria to reproduce in these cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A decade ago, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4450703/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory &lt;a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory/evidence/health-effects/water-and-food-borne-diseases/legionnaires-disease-factsheet"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire’s disease a more widespread issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The EPA also &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/climate_and_microbial_iaq.pdf"&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; the bacteria’s range to expand as global temperatures rise. Each heat wave and heavy rainstorm creates the hot and wet conditions that allow Legionella to thrive. Flooding can allow Legionella-tainted water to more easily penetrate a community’s water system, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire’s disease. As the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/nyregion/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-harlem-new-york.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;reported recently&lt;/a&gt;, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods — and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire’s, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/why-so-many-legionnaires-cases-in-ny-environmental-and-human-factors-may-play-a-role"&gt;The Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This dynamic isn’t unique to Legionnaire’s disease. As the EPA has &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-socially-vulnerable-people"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt;, low-income people are more likely to face health consequences from climate change because they are more likely to live in places exposed to extreme weather, they are more likely to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases and natural disasters — and they are more likely to live with the kind of aging infrastructure that allows Legionnaire’s to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. It is as deadly as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis#:~:text=A%20total%20of%201.25%20million,lives%20since%20the%20year%202000."&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, though Legionnaire’s disease usually kills much faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire’s disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you’re over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you’re registered for alerts from your local public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/control-legionella/php/toolkit/potable-water-systems-module.html"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. If you use an evaporative cooler or your home is equipped with a swamp cooler, you can make sure you’re keeping them clean and using filtered water, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. The problem resides much further up the water supply chain, in the massive community water systems where Legionella flourish. You can’t suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, whenever you know Legionnaire’s disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said &lt;a href="https://legionella.org/about/the-team/janet-e-stout-phd/"&gt;Janet Stout&lt;/a&gt;, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you’re experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire’s disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as Levofloxacin or Azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17750-legionnaires-disease"&gt;Most cases can be cured&lt;/a&gt; if they are caught early enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this is a truly &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person’s own, individual effort can do to stop infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The main way to prevent Legionnaire’s disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/harlemites-outraged-they-were-kept-in-dark-about-deadly-nyc-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-tied-to-city-owned-buildings-irresponsible/"&gt;were inspected in the first six months of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a steep drop-off from 2017 when the city had checked more than 5,000 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire’s disease seriously.

Here’s what you need to know about the science so far, with input from a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (the biological liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord) from 10 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 people who did not have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They discovered that lipoproteins (round particles made of fat and protein) in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients were less effective at delivering cholesterol to neurons, or nerve cells, which are responsible for transmitting information from the brain throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cholesterol is an essential, waxy, fat-like molecule that your body needs for good health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NHLBI). Cholesterol is carried around your body by two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. HDL or “good” cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can cause a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque in your arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health complications, per the NHLBI. But high levels of good HDL cholesterol may lower the risk for certain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While it has a bad rap in the health world, cholesterol is actually really important for your proper brain function. Your brain is the most &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:-rich organ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;-rich organ&lt;/a&gt; in your body. Specifically, cholesterol helps make up cell membranes, including those in nerve cells, and plays a crucial role in your neurons' ability to "talk" to each other and transmit information. When cholesterol levels are out of balance, it can impact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs12276-024-01273-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65821905%2Fcholesterol-alzheimers-link-apoe4-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:transmission of essential information;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;transmission of essential information&lt;/a&gt; between nerve cells, leading to cognitive issues that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Cholesterol is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/165/4/bqae032/7631422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:building block;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;building block&lt;/a&gt; for steroid hormones, which support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, that doesn't mean more cholesterol is always good for your brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol are usually considered a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, or “clogged pipes” in the brain, explains Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is less research and understanding on the possible benefits of cholesterol found in spinal fluid including HDL, which we classically identify as the ‘good cholesterol,’” Dr. Segil says. “We know high levels of certain types of cholesterol cause strokes and we are less clear in the year 2025 about the benefits of cholesterol in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this link back to Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This particular study noted that cholesterol found in lipoproteins were different in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but Dr. Segil says that there is a “complicated” relationship between lipids and protein in the brain. “Some researchers continue to assign memory loss symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s due to abnormal brain protein levels and this paper noted lipid brain levels may also be abnormal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Segil points out that neurologists commonly prescribe medications called statins to lower levels of cholesterol and the risk of stroke. Lowering levels of LDL cholesterol can decrease the risk of developing certain type of dementia, including vascular dementia, he says. But it’s not clear if it may do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Further research will determine if lowering your cholesterol will result in lower chances of getting Alzheimer’s dementia,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNV1ptLW1FQzA3S2h1M2Itb1ZVYVBXX2RHamdEY081UmZPVHJNdWV1cjhLUENIY3RSb1ZwcjBTUUs5YjZqWmo2LUVJZkFFNVo5NTF4d2RDSldFUk1uOTh1TmpkbFNXNmk0SkREajRrUE0xQnZiamV4MVZoaGw3WC1LODVSQTFhUQ</guid></item><item><title>这个男人想让你知道疫苗的真相- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFPSAYoBQVVfeXFMTU1tNUhfXzcwalZoN0kwNGI2U0hYS3I1WGtuTEdzUEtBZHNlQXhudl91TkZfYVFrVy1IRVM2NDAzWnBaOV8wdkFVV1EzWmVURXVBQ3VHSy1VZlprVTlFTnpZcklRM0lxbF83R2hpcDdvQVVfeGdlanJOdGJ2VkQ4YU0tQjU2eTNxWkJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001b2e6d2jrhbn2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00222e6dk15165po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeje0o4x000d3b6qpuan2x31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002h2e6docpmca6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002i2e6d3zhed2sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002j2e6dczq7ix1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002k2e6d3np7gx6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, children don’t get 92 shots by the time they’re 18, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356762306130021" target="_blank"&gt;he explained recently on X&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you count annual flu shots, it’s about 48 to 51.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002l2e6drox9l1r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, we do know the safety profiles of vaccines, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356765992943997" target="_blank"&gt;he shared in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej56yei00053b6qacfn79aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002o2e6dvtm3juow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFPSAYoBQVVfeXFMTU1tNUhfXzcwalZoN0kwNGI2U0hYS3I1WGtuTEdzUEtBZHNlQXhudl91TkZfYVFrVy1IRVM2NDAzWnBaOV8wdkFVV1EzWmVURXVBQ3VHSy1VZlprVTlFTnpZcklRM0lxbF83R2hpcDdvQVVfeGdlanJOdGJ2VkQ4YU0tQjU2eTNxWkJ3</guid></item><item><title>这个男人想让你知道疫苗的真相- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001b2e6d2jrhbn2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00222e6dk15165po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.

            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:

            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.

            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.

you're likely to experience with Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But for women who claim to be experiencing 'Ozempic vulva', these sound like a walk in the park in comparison &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-women-vulva-news-828013-20250819"&gt;to what they're dealing with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Numerous females who have been using the GLP-1 medications for weight loss purposes have complained that this side effect has now started to cause them aggravation on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although Ozempic vulva isn't an official medical term and is not a recognised side effect by manufacturers Novo Nordisk, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;-based physician explained that loads of women have been complaining of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Michael Tahery &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.drtahery.com/ozempic-vagina-what-are-the-side-effects-of-semaglutide"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; that weight loss drugs can impact the vulva and vagina in three ways - causing sagging of the outer labia, weakness of the vaginal muscles, and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As those consuming weight loss drugs often shed the pounds rapidly, this can cause their skin to sag...and unfortunately ladies, the vulva is not immune to this either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It may result in visible sagging of the labia or vagina because of overall fat and volume loss," Dr Tahery said. "This sagging is caused by loose labia loose skin in the vaginal area, wrinkles, or some combination of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It’s also common for rapid weight loss to cause the labia to suddenly feel out of proportion compared to how it previously felt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The latter part of that sentence has hit the nail on the head for a number of ladies who have been complaining about Ozempic vulva and everything that comes with it on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One woman shared a post explaining that she wanted to know if she was the only one who was left feeling seriously out of sorts by the change in appearance of their private parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I have lost 30% of my starting weight and obviously have had a significant change in body shape,' she said. "One of the weirder side effects is that I am far more aware of my labia now, not in a sexual way, but just in a being aware of a body part I was not previously very aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' has been causing chaos for some ladies (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I am not a prudish person by nature, but it is sometimes to the point where I feel uncomfortable about it. I wonder if it's to do with the size of my upper thighs, actually - that there used to be a lot more cushion and now there is a gap? Anyway, it's weird and probably the thing I least expected to occur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This ended up sparking quite the mother's meeting about how their protruding labia's were seriously getting in the way, how people are struggling to adapt to it and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-females-vulva-women-097174-20250818"&gt;how it can impact your sex life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One person said: "Yep.

I'm very confused and getting used to this new way of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A third added: "Mine's gone saggy," while a fourth commented: "I can't feel my wee coming out anymore, what is that?!?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a statement, Novo Nordisk told LADbible that 'patient safety is of the utmost importance to' the pharmaceutical firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 RA medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety," it said.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8p48y0003ykvktg78px6rx@published"&gt;About 3 million Americans die every year. Compared with other rich countries, we die at an alarmingly higher rate: One-quarter of those deaths wouldn’t have occurred if America were only as deadly as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cpo000k3b79ro42jerr@published"&gt;Zoom in, and things get even more concerning: Among Americans younger than 65, almost half of deaths wouldn’t happen if we had a death rate that matched our peers. Among those aged 25 to 44, a group we call “early adults,” it’s 62 percent—nearly two out of three deaths at those early ages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0csc000l3b79u93k4zdb@published"&gt;We’re mortality experts, and these facts stem from &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1118"&gt;an analysis we did&lt;/a&gt; of death rates in 22 countries from 1980 through 2023 (the last year with reliable data). When we set out to do this research, we expected to find a story about the COVID-19 pandemic. America’s pandemic experience was much worse than that of our peers, with three U.S. deaths for every two in peer countries. Nonelderly Americans in particular were hit harder than nonelderly populations in other rich countries. This disadvantage only grew as vaccinations became available but were adopted by Americans at lower rates.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cuu000m3b79jg7i4jwq@published"&gt;But what surprised us was that, from today’s postpandemic vantage point, the American health disadvantage &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; look like a pandemic story at all. The U.S. mortality disadvantage has been growing at about the same rate for years, and while it spiked during COVID-19, it still continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cya000n3b79bc9nwgyz@published"&gt;Here’s another way to put this: In 2023 there were about 700,000 “missing Americans”—those who died in 2023 but would be alive if they had lived somewhere else. And that 700,000 is almost exactly the number that we could’ve predicted back in 2019, based solely on prepandemic trends. COVID and relatively low vaccine adoption are a problem for Americans. But our country seems to be, at a deeper level, a deadly place to live. What’s more, all of the studies we have (with some limited exceptions, like a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836256"&gt;study specific to California&lt;/a&gt;) stop before Donald Trump began his second term with enormous cuts to medical and health research and, now, to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d1j000o3b791106vxt1@published"&gt;There is a heated—and productive—debate about exactly why the U.S. is so much worse than our peers at keeping its populace alive. One influential theory focuses on deindustrialization and the way that Americans without a college degree in particular have been left behind. Another focuses on the way that social safety nets in this country, such as for unemployment, sickness, and pensions, remain small and insufficient compared with other wealthy countries. Others point to problems in the U.S. health care system, such as uninsurance, underinsurance, and high co-payments and deductibles, and to underlying trends in chronic diseases that might be caused by nutritional policy failures. Still others highlight America’s permissive gun laws and the large amount of time we spend in our cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d78000p3b793t5pd0yw@published"&gt;These theories, which aren’t mutually exclusive, all predate COVID-19 and offer plausible explanations for the growing U.S. mortality disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d9x000q3b79670yam7a@published"&gt;But our research also uncovered one population for whom the pandemic does look like a longer-term turning point for the worse. And that population is a worrisome one: Americans early in their adulthood, those aged 25 to 44—that is, millennials, as well as some older members of Gen Z .&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0ddh000r3b799ujnlqt0@published"&gt;Before 2010, the estimated lifespan for American early adults increased every year. Deaths from HIV and cancer were plummeting. Homicides had fallen dramatically, and fatalities from circulatory disease, a major cause of death at every adult age, were also falling in this age group. But sometime after 2010, for almost every cause of death, this changed. Early adults proved especially susceptible to drug overdose deaths as synthetic fentanyl swept the country, but also became increasingly likely to die in car collisions and from digestive diseases and diabetes, and stopped making much progress in death rates from circulatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dgp000s3b790a8ux7nu@published"&gt;Just as for other adult age groups, when COVID-19 arrived in 2020 and 2021, mortality increased markedly among early adults. Alongside COVID-19 deaths were major increases in deaths from drug overdose, transportation, alcohol, homicide, circulatory disease, suicide, and other causes, as the country’s social structures and health system buckled under the stress of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dk8000t3b79kucgo8cx@published"&gt;But when older adults’ death rates plummeted after the pandemic, early adults lost only a little over half of the additional deaths that the pandemic years had brought. Before the pandemic, early adults’ mortality trends closely mirrored other adult age groups. Since COVID-19, their increased mortality is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dni000u3b79hmzx07t8@published"&gt;The result of all this? By 2023, American early adults’ chance of dying was 70 percent higher than it would have been had the lifesaving trends of the early 2000s continued. And this leaves them 2.6 times as likely to die as early adults in other rich countries. Amid declining economic prospects and future optimism among younger American adults, perhaps no statistic more starkly captures the disadvantage of entering adulthood in the U.S. today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dqr000v3b79kwqi56lk@published"&gt;We don’t know exactly why this is happening. Some changes related to the pandemic seem relatively obvious: employment loss and insecurity that disproportionately impacted younger workers, increased alcohol consumption and drug use, and coincided with high rates of depression that continued to distinctly affect early adults following the peak pandemic. This age group experienced hardships during COVID-19 that are difficult to bounce back from.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dym000x3b79w2epwcj6@published"&gt;People who are 25 to 44 have experienced major turning points in this country’s history: The oldest of them were Reagan babies who launched their careers in the shadow of the Great Recession, and the youngest entered adulthood during a worldwide pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e28000y3b7971895xgp@published"&gt;In the 2028 election, millennial and Gen Z voters will account for half of the U.S. electorate. Many of these early adults are disillusioned with a political and economic system that does not provide living wages, stable employment, housing security, or affordable health care. As social mobility in the U.S. has decreased, the prospect of homeownership and marriage has also become unattainable for many early adults, regardless of how hard they work. And now millennial and Gen Z Americans are far more likely to die than their age peers in other rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e4s000z3b7903podtn9@published"&gt;These economic and health inequities are likely to further increase with cuts to the country’s social safety net, including to programs such as Medicaid, to pay for tax cuts for high earners. Technological advancements may lead to widening income inequality if stable jobs are replaced by A.I. Investing in millennials and Gen Z should be a top policy priority. Politicians looking to win votes would do well to make it a key part of their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

have created a handheld device that is designed to trace tiny magnetic particles injected into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists said this offers a non-toxic alternative to radioactive tracers and dyes currently used in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastasis, when cancer cells spread from the original &lt;a href="/topic/tumour"&gt;tumour&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the body, is one of the most serious challenges in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors often rely on tests to see whether the cancer has reached the lymph nodes – the areas of tissue that filter fluid in your body for harmful substances – which can guide decisions about surgery and further care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Applied&lt;/em&gt;, describe how &lt;a href="/topic/diamonds"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fluid, made up of iron oxide nanoparticles, travels through the body alongside cancer cells, revealing whether they have reached the lymph nodes, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfrwcF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=1008%2C0%2C1008%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=1008%2C0%2C1008%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The findings, published in Physical Review Applied, describe how diamonds can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32030"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The findings, published in Physical Review Applied, describe how diamonds can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Karishma Gokani/University of Warwick)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Alex Newman, a PhD student in Warwick University’s physics department, said the new tool could improve the way doctors find cancer in keyhole and endoscopic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a real demand for versatile non-toxic means of finding cancer,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this new diamond-based sensor, we managed to get the size of the sensor head down to just 10 millimetres, which means it is the first diamond sensor to be able to detect magnetic tracer fluid while being small enough for endoscopic use and keyhole surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Newman added that the device was extremely sensitive, capable of detecting just one hundredth of the typical dose of magnetic tracer fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design uses a diamond measuring only half a cubic millimetre alongside a small permanent magnet, the scientists said &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added that this compact structure means there is no need for bulky electronics, allowing the sensor to be used by hand in operating rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Gavin Morley, who leads the research group, said the breakthrough was possible thanks to nitrogen vacancy centres inside the diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These allow the diamond to detect very small changes in the magnetic field and give the diamonds a lovely pink colour,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the technology could also have uses beyond medicine, including in spacecraft and fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current techniques for tracing cancer cells rely on radioactive tracers, which not all hospitals can access, or blue dyes, which trigger allergic reactions in some patients, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians involved in this new project believe the new diamond sensor could help avoid these complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Robertson, a consultant breast cancer surgeon at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, said he was already using magnetic localisation in his work. He added that it offers more advantages over traditional techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the device could eventually be applied to various cancers, including lung, liver, colorectal and oesophageal tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 09:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQX1hkSFJuYjA4MnhLMERHSWNfZzVvd1B4LVJuLVJNWWFZc3k1WFp1R2lLY2Z3YXhleEowX196Tkt0QnpuNjh0dTJBRW90MXVxeDExaVotMEtxVmJfWFlMbVg5cHZld185VExILXlWOHp6UFNyQ3BUc2VMRXcwbUlZc2UxYjVoS2xqa0wtTFNWMXdJUVFYZlQyYVVFTjFvOXNCOUl4VE9UWnY</guid></item><item><title>拥有面部触手的“弗兰肯斯坦”兔子现在对人类构成威胁-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOY3p3REx6bmdwa1Z3V3pkLVBEaTlQUWs3SXBnNkdUWjhiX1ZwSzl6SFp2VWkxaEhnMFZkZWxhSVlwQUxBY256R3pneVplX0NkeDFjUG5jYi0yZXRleHpRbnlyWXQweF9tZTBfNl94dHBiX0JzMHdGV0xEMjRxS3BLZWxObUlsUmFFb29xYVRLU3k0cG80Yl91V0tlWlNEZ0NUdUlJY3I3Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More 'Frankenstein' rabbits are appearing across the US, sparking fears of a wider outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Originally spotted in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-04ed05f0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, these bizarre rabbits, with tentacle-like growths sprouting from their faces, have now been reported in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-04ef9e00-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nebraska/index.html" id="mol-04f01330-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-dakota/index.html" id="mol-04f14bb0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The animals are infected with cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, which can be spread through mosquito and tick bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans are unlikely to contract CRPV, Dr Omer Awan of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-04ef01c0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine cautioned that people could still face risks from other diseases carried by ticks or mosquitoes that have fed on infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You're not going to get CRPV, and you likely won't show symptoms of it,' Dr Awan told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, you could still be indirectly exposed through ticks or mosquitoes that have fed on infected animals, which means you might contract a different disease.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, illnesses spread by disease-carrying pests to humans include Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, both spread by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, Dengue Fever and Chikungunya are all spread by mosquitoes and can be fatal in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user recently posted images of a rabbit in Shope papilloma virus in Saint Paul, Minnesota in late July&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A user on Reddit posted an image in 2024 of a rabbit in Fort Collins, Colorado exhibiting signs of Shope papilloma virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan advised the best course of action is to avoid contact with infected rabbits and ensure any pet rabbits are protected from insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan also warned Americans should prepare for the possibility of seeing even more cases of this grotesque condition spreading beyond the Midwest in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'Because temperatures are becoming warmer, we're gonna start to see it become more prevalent as the years go on, and also to spread in areas where it hasn't been before,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a series of states already in the Midwest, but perhaps it could go even more south in the United States, maybe Southwest as well. I do believe that this will become more of an increasing problem as time goes on,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that it's 'extremely unlikely' that CRPV will eventually jump to humans, even as cases among rabbits grow, but he admitted that it's not completely impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can never say never with science or with viruses, because they always mutate and things can change very fast, but I don't see that happening in the near future with CRPV,' the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest sightings posted on social media have moved north of Colorado, reaching several major cities in central Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a series of pictures posted to Reddit in late July, one person revealed that infected rabbits were now in Saint Paul. Others reported seeing them in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in Plymouth, and our neighborhood bunnies have the same thing,' another Minnesota resident added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A video posted to X on August 18 captured a rabbit with its face covered in CRPV growths in Sioux Falls, South Dakota - nearly 500 miles from the sightings in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus is not thought to be painful unless the growths affect a rabbit's eyes or mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Another Reddit user captured images of a rabbit in Colorado (pictured) exhibiting the early stages of the disease spreading throughout the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first sign that a rabbit has the virus is red, raised spots on their skin that eventually turn into wart-like tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, these warts develop into keratinized papillomas, the 'horns' and 'tentacles' seen growing out of midwestern rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some of the warts can turn into a squamous cell carcinoma, a serious skin cancer that can be deadly if it spreads and isn't treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that even if the warts don't turn cancerous, they can continue to grow for years and become a major vulnerability to rabbits in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What can happen is they can obstruct their vision, it can get close to their mouths, and it can prevent them from feeding properly, and they can even starve,' the medical expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For others, it can make them more vulnerable to predators. So, it can certainly do harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan claimed climate change was the driving force behind the widespread increase in sightings this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the time when mosquitoes and ticks thrive in these warmer temperatures, so because they're able to thrive, they're able to infect more rabbits, and hence, we're getting more CRPV cases,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's not just cases of rabbit diseases that are going up. Cases of Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in humans have risen in the US in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Obesity drugs such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Wegovy and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Zepbound can also be difficult to access due to their high costs, limited U.S. insurance coverage and constrained supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, any patient can purchase a Signos membership to access its system. It uses an AI platform and an off-the-shelf continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, from &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/DXCM/"&gt;Dexcom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to offer personalized, real-time data and lifestyle recommendations for weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is now a solution that everybody can use to help on the weight loss journey, and you don't have to be a certain number of pounds to use it. It's available for the average American who needs it," said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, Signos' co-founder and CEO, in an interview on Tuesday ahead of the approval. "The average person might have five pounds to lose, or others might have 100 pounds to lose. We are here to help them at any point in that journey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obesity epidemic costs the U.S. health-care system &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/php/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than $170 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Almost 74% of Americans are overweight or obese, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" target="_blank"&gt;government data&lt;/a&gt; says. Signos hopes it can make a "real big dent in that curve for the betterment of many of us," Fouladgar-Mercer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who sign up for Signos can &lt;a href="https://store.signos.com/plan?c=fall20&amp;amp;amp;amp;_gl=1*7uhji3*_gcl_au*MTk0ODg5MDgwOS4xNjk3NDgwNDE2" target="_blank"&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; a three-month or six-month plan, which currently costs $139 and $129, respectively. The company will ship out all of the CGMs a patient needs for the number of months in the plan they choose.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers currently don't cover the system for weight management, but the plans are a fraction of the roughly $1,000 monthly price of GLP-1s in the U.S. Signos is working with health insurance companies and employers to get coverage for the system, the company said in a statement to CNBC. Signos said it expects "this to evolve quickly as interest for tackling weight continued to expand." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Signos system can be used in combination with GLP-1s or bariatric surgery, said Fouladgar-Mercer. He said patients can also use the system after getting off a GLP-1 to maintain their weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGMs are small sensors worn on the upper arm that track glucose levels, mainly for people with diabetes. That data is wirelessly sent to Signos' app, which also allows patients to log their food intake and exercise levels, among other information that the AI platform uses to make recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping people lose pounds, the system aims to help users understand how their bodies respond to specific foods and exercise patterns and make the right behavioral changes to manage and maintain their weight in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signos did not share how many patients are currently using its glucose monitoring system, but Fouladgar-Mercer said tens of thousands of people have already tried it over time. He said Signos has scaled up its CGM inventory and software capacity to "handle a pretty massive scale" following the approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 04:02:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNWUhhLVF4RTQ3ZWVfQ1lxbVpZSjNwVXVLNW9rMW5iZkpxaWlSMmo5SHdzZGl3UFdzaGt5ZTFxSTdxaVByblJVaFQ4VUF0ZWtjclBFSnc5akNFU294cVlhT2ZxSnUtT3lIQ20yWF83TEpoYzM1ajZvQVFsNEZESWJpQzB4QUtaamc4ZnFmN2hWZU5QZXVBTGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTVB0SGJ1RDlLSF9FOTZsX2U3U0MtempzY1pPYmZTb0lBa1EwTFFGMldsdlFCMmxvenY5TERsNHE2bW5BWjVjbTNIVWNuV2ZEdnF6X3JfY3d1TTdkLW5pYm5pc29NVzlJU2hEQlY5OUNsUHRxM0Flb2lSMFd2T25UT1VfQk5KYzY4ZXktbm93TENjdFlXTHNxdVpoSXM</guid></item><item><title>一项为期30年的研究刚刚发现了您的薯条和糖尿病- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxONnN0bndBNmduM09xLThPRWNrTTVDQ1FBbl9NOWRTUkxjZm52cHRMa3lkaFpzMTN6ejk1VjVPTjRwazhERlBRUGt1c1RyLU1UN1lwVWU1Wjl4dFJWTjBtNUZKTGFGNFdRUlVBMU1LRXd6ak9TQ1dkVmJJeHplQnFJb2czcmhDN20zNUxuYkVvUXB2NVpPdUY3bVNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 03:40:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxONnN0bndBNmduM09xLThPRWNrTTVDQ1FBbl9NOWRTUkxjZm52cHRMa3lkaFpzMTN6ejk1VjVPTjRwazhERlBRUGt1c1RyLU1UN1lwVWU1Wjl4dFJWTjBtNUZKTGFGNFdRUlVBMU1LRXd6ak9TQ1dkVmJJeHplQnFJb2czcmhDN20zNUxuYkVvUXB2NVpPdUY3bVNn</guid></item><item><title>我们并不特别：一本新书挑战人类例外论-黑客新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTFBnZzFURV9PTVVqdTFkcG9tSkRpN3RqTTNaT2NMRFpzZjRoUTNZRW1RYnRQaTF3cVFZMEo2MWhOVU9yaDNTMjJ2TnJqaHh2TTQxRUpVVDBHUEI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:51:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTFBnZzFURV9PTVVqdTFkcG9tSkRpN3RqTTNaT2NMRFpzZjRoUTNZRW1RYnRQaTF3cVFZMEo2MWhOVU9yaDNTMjJ2TnJqaHh2TTQxRUpVVDBHUEI</guid></item><item><title>加州居民鼠疫检测呈阳性。官员指责太浩湖跳蚤-洛杉矶时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOHl1bTh3ZXNOTmE3OTFNSVprR0poeHY3MVZocXV4ajVtOXJKZ2hld19BMWQ1MUxIOTZlV3NVV0NTQjRXNWZDeFFkT1hrQTYyNndtWnJzRFdwWVdnWnZCSEM5U2J5T29GcFJwbGgtbThRRzZXMVVzNWFycHlveGg2RWZpcFFMME9KZmptU1ZoeXJRTXlkZjBhVzRpb2xWVkJVeHpVeDlEYXJQZEtRc0Etck1QZlBRWGV0eXpsbU1WeUQzc0dSTnY2RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;tested positive for the plague&lt;/a&gt; — yes, the same pest-transmitted disease estimated to have killed 25 million Europeans in the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the person contracted the rare and dangerous disease after being bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, according to El Dorado County health officials. The patient is under the care of a medical professional and recovering at home, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher-elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet,  the county’s acting director of public health, said in a statement. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a very serious disease but can be treated with easily available antibiotics, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sooner a patient is diagnosed and receives treatment, the greater their chances of making a full recovery, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/i&gt;and is most commonly spread to humans by bites from infected fleas, according to El Dorado County health officials. The disease can also be spread by infected-rodent bites or by exposure to infected dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is extremely uncommon and infects on average seven people in the U.S. per year, according to the CDC. Nevertheless, it must be taken seriously because of the high potential for death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last plague case reported in El Dorado County was in 2020 and was also believed to be transmitted in the South Lake Tahoe area, health officials said. Two California plague cases were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;reported in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, probably caused by bites from an infected flea or rodent in Yosemite National Park. All three patients received treatment and made a full recovery, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 45 ground squirrels or chipmunks recorded with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium in the Lake Tahoe Basin from 2021 to the present, according to the California Department of Public Health, which routinely monitors rodent populations for plague activity across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Dorado County health officials urged residents and visitors to take steps to avoid exposure to rodents or ticks when exploring the wilderness around Lake Tahoe.  Measures include wearing long pants tucked into boots, using a bug repellent with DEET, never feeding or touching rodents, refraining from camping near animal burrows or dead rodents, and leaving dogs at home when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of plague cases in the U.S. have been in the bubonic form, from which patients will develop swollen, painful lymph nodes called buboes, according to the CDC. This form of the disease typically results from an infected-flea bite, and symptoms such as buboes, fever, headache, chills and weakness develop within two to eight days, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-07-12/northern-arizona-resident-dies-from-plague"&gt;Arizona resident died&lt;/a&gt; of the pneumonic form of the plague, which can develop when bacteria spread to the lungs of a patient with untreated bubonic plague. This is the most serious form of the plague and can have an incubation period of just one day. It’s also the only form of the plague that can spread from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Middle Ages, infected rats were to blame for the  Black Death in Europe in the 14th century. The last urban rat-infected plague outbreak in America &lt;a class="link" href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/4/9/21211280/quarantine-plague-los-angeles-mexican-district" target="_blank"&gt;took place in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 and 1925, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOHl1bTh3ZXNOTmE3OTFNSVprR0poeHY3MVZocXV4ajVtOXJKZ2hld19BMWQ1MUxIOTZlV3NVV0NTQjRXNWZDeFFkT1hrQTYyNndtWnJzRFdwWVdnWnZCSEM5U2J5T29GcFJwbGgtbThRRzZXMVVzNWFycHlveGg2RWZpcFFMME9KZmptU1ZoeXJRTXlkZjBhVzRpb2xWVkJVeHpVeDlEYXJQZEtRc0Etck1QZlBRWGV0eXpsbU1WeUQzc0dSTnY2RQ</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性，可能被受感染的跳蚤叮咬- KCRA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNRm01cmhuNDBzSzJGU0NiRWV3R0N2Q1UyaDFvVUJUSjhMY0lyR0FZYmd0QXNLQWlFaHFqVTBOZEFyaE8zRDExcGFYNlVyWUJnR01RWXlDencyb3JYYVZVU0s1NXpteG4yTWMtTE1tY0Q2Vm5YNHQ5QmE0WTdQdm9Fd3Z3QTY4OGktX2FYWW9nZkNRYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

Dogs and cats can also bring infected fleas into the home. People are urged to keep pets leashed and away from rodent burrows. Both people and pets should avoid touching sick, injured or dead rodents, or feeding any rodents. People can also avoid contact with infected fleas by wearing long pants tucked into boots and by spraying insect repellent with DEET on socks and pant cuffs. Plague symptoms include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes.

							&lt;p data-start="375" data-end="621"&gt;Serums help—no question. But the cells that build collagen, calm redness, and repair damage run on what we eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="375" data-end="621"&gt;The nutrients that travel through your bloodstream reach places creams can’t: they nourish skin cells from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="623" data-end="936"&gt;That’s why dermatologists and dietitians increasingly point to diet as a cornerstone of skin health. Plant-derived antioxidants and vitamins don’t just protect against sun and pollution damage—they measurably improve hydration, elasticity, and barrier function over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="938" data-end="1274"&gt;So if your routine stops at the bathroom mirror, you’re only getting half the picture. Juicing plants that are rich in skin-supporting compounds gives you a concentrated, tasty way to work beauty from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="938" data-end="1274"&gt;Here are seven vegan blends that deliver flavor, science-backed benefits, and practical tips you can fold into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1281" data-end="1332"&gt;1. Carrot-orange-turmeric for a vitamin A glow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1334" data-end="1598"&gt;Carrots are famous for their beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A that your body converts into retinol. Oranges supply vitamin C, which helps collagen strands stay firm, while turmeric provides curcumin, one of the most researched natural anti-inflammatories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1600" data-end="1975"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1600" data-end="1617"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin A supports cell turnover—think fresher, smoother-looking skin. Vitamin C builds resilience against UV damage and keeps collagen intact. Turmeric’s curcumin reduces inflammatory pathways that can worsen redness or breakouts. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1559032/full"&gt;2025 study in &lt;em data-start="1866" data-end="1893"&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked curcumin to improved wound healing and reduced oxidative stress in skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1977" data-end="2226"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1977" data-end="1996"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 4 medium carrots, 2 peeled oranges, and a thumb-sized knob of turmeric root. If you only have turmeric powder, stir in ½ teaspoon afterward. Add a pinch of black pepper—it helps your body absorb curcumin more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2228" data-end="2368"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2228" data-end="2242"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; This juice keeps its bright orange pigment because of carotenoids. Store it in a glass jar, not plastic, to avoid staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2375" data-end="2424"&gt;2. Cucumber-mint-lime for hydration and calm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2426" data-end="2600"&gt;Cucumbers are 96% water, but the real star is silica, a trace mineral linked to collagen production. Mint soothes digestion, and lime adds vitamin C with a refreshing tang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2602" data-end="2965"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2602" data-end="2619"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration plumps skin cells in a way moisturizers alone can’t. Meanwhile, vitamin C is a crucial cofactor for repairing micro-damage from sun exposure and keeping collagen production on track. Together, this combo supports both skin smoothness and overall calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2967" data-end="3115"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2967" data-end="2986"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 1 large cucumber with a handful of fresh mint and the juice of ½ lime. Chill before drinking for that spa-water upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3117" data-end="3243"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3117" data-end="3131"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want more body, blend instead of juicing. The fiber slows down absorption and keeps you fuller longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3250" data-end="3309"&gt;3. Beet-apple-ginger for circulation and detox support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3311" data-end="3549"&gt;Beets are rich in dietary nitrates that convert to nitric oxide, a compound that widens blood vessels and improves circulation. Apples bring quercetin, a flavonoid that reduces oxidative stress, while ginger adds anti-inflammatory zing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3551" data-end="3959"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3551" data-end="3568"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8565237/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that beet juice significantly improves blood flow and reduced oxidative stress markers. Increased circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach your skin cells, giving that natural post-exercise flush without the treadmill. Quercetin helps reduce UV-related skin stress, while gingerol compounds lower markers of systemic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3961" data-end="4133"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3961" data-end="3980"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 1 medium beet, 2 crisp apples, and a thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger. If the beet flavor is too earthy, add a squeeze of lemon to brighten it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4135" data-end="4257"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4135" data-end="4149"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Beets stain everything. Rinse your juicer parts right away, or you’ll be scrubbing pink streaks for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4264" data-end="4317"&gt;4. Kale-pineapple-lemon for collagen and clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4319" data-end="4550"&gt;Dark leafy greens like kale offer lutein and vitamin K, both linked to healthier skin tone and reduced oxidative stress. Pineapple supplies bromelain, an enzyme with gentle exfoliating properties, while lemon adds more vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4552" data-end="4935"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4552" data-end="4569"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Lutein has been shown in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464620304898"&gt;controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; to increase skin’s resistance to UV-induced damage. Vitamin K helps reduce the appearance of dark under-eye circles by supporting capillary strength. Bromelain may help calm puffiness and mild inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4937" data-end="5071"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4937" data-end="4956"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 2 cups chopped kale, 1 cup pineapple chunks, and ½ peeled lemon. For a milder flavor, add half a cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5073" data-end="5172"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5073" data-end="5087"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Roll your kale leaves before juicing to release more juice and fewer bitter notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5179" data-end="5236"&gt;5. Pomegranate-blueberry for anti-aging antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5238" data-end="5506"&gt;Pomegranates and blueberries are loaded with polyphenols. These compounds neutralize free radicals—the unstable molecules that accelerate wrinkles and sagging. They also contain ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which protect collagen and help reduce hyperpigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5508" data-end="5747"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5508" data-end="5525"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pomegranate-juice-and-extract-consumption-by-healthy-women-increases-resistance-to-sun-damage"&gt;Research from UCLA&lt;/a&gt; found that pomegranate extract reduce resistance to sun damage. Anthocyanins in blueberries also strengthen tiny blood vessels, which supports even skin tone and reduces visible redness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5749" data-end="5954"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5749" data-end="5768"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend (not juice) 1 cup pomegranate arils, 1 cup blueberries, and ½ cup water. Strain if you prefer a smoother texture, but keeping the fiber helps regulate blood sugar and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5956" data-end="6086"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5956" data-end="5970"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Frozen blueberries work as well as fresh here—and they’re often picked at peak ripeness, preserving antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6093" data-end="6144"&gt;6. Celery-pear-parsley for clarity and balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6146" data-end="6371"&gt;Celery has become trendy for a reason: its mineral salts may support hydration balance and reduce puffiness. Pears provide gentle fiber, easing digestion, while parsley adds chlorophyll, which supports liver detox pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6373" data-end="6694"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6373" data-end="6390"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Many skin issues are tied to digestion. A healthier gut translates to clearer, calmer skin. Chlorophyll has been studied for its antioxidant capacity, reducing markers of oxidative stress in animal and human models. Pairing it with celery’s natural electrolytes makes this juice a great morning reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6696" data-end="6850"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6696" data-end="6715"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 3 celery stalks, 1 ripe pear, and a small handful of parsley. Drink in the morning to start the day with a mineral-rich boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6852" data-end="6945"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6852" data-end="6866"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the whole pear with skin—it’s where much of the antioxidant power lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6952" data-end="7012"&gt;7. Watermelon-strawberry-basil for hydration and repair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7014" data-end="7225"&gt;Watermelon is rich in lycopene, an antioxidant that accumulates in the skin and helps protect against sun damage. Strawberries are vitamin C superstars, while basil brings antibacterial and calming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7227" data-end="7515"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7227" data-end="7244"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Lycopene has been shown in multiple studies, including a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11179732/"&gt;2024 &lt;em data-start="7307" data-end="7337"&gt;Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, to reduce UV-induced redness and oxidative stress. Vitamin C powers collagen synthesis. Together, this combo is tailor-made for summer when sun exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7517" data-end="7639"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7517" data-end="7536"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend 2 cups watermelon, 1 cup strawberries, and 4–5 basil leaves until smooth. Serve cold over ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7641" data-end="7723"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7641" data-end="7655"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Watermelon juice separates quickly—give it a stir before sipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7730" data-end="7765"&gt;How to make juice work for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7767" data-end="7913"&gt;Juicing doesn’t have to mean buying $12 green bottles at a boutique café. With a little strategy, it can become a sustainable, affordable habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7915" data-end="8479"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7915" data-end="8008"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7917" data-end="8008"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7917" data-end="7943"&gt;No juicer? No problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a blender and strain through a nut milk bag or fine sieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8009" data-end="8152"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8011" data-end="8152"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8011" data-end="8027"&gt;Drink fresh.&lt;/strong&gt; Nutrients degrade quickly. Ideally, consume juice within 20 minutes, or store in an airtight glass jar for up to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8153" data-end="8259"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8155" data-end="8259"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8155" data-end="8174"&gt;Balance sugars.&lt;/strong&gt; Too much fruit can spike blood sugar. Pair sweeter juices with greens or cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8260" data-end="8373"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8262" data-end="8373"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8262" data-end="8285"&gt;Consistency counts.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like topical skincare, results show with regular use—2–3 times a week is plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8374" data-end="8479"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8376" data-end="8479"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8376" data-end="8403"&gt;Think of it as synergy.&lt;/strong&gt; Juices complement, not replace, a plant-forward diet rich in whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8486" data-end="8507"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8509" data-end="8798"&gt;This isn’t just about glowing skin. Choosing plant-powered juices aligns with bigger goals: climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and community health. Each glass reduces reliance on animal-based products and packaged, single-use plastics tied to the conventional beauty industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8800" data-end="9033"&gt;By leaning on carrots instead of collagen powders, or parsley instead of pills, you’re supporting local farmers, cutting environmental costs, and proving that wellness doesn’t have to come in a jar shipped halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9035" data-end="9264"&gt;Skin health, climate health, and community health are inseparable. Every time you juice beets, blend berries, or stir turmeric into a glass, you’re investing in your own resilience and the planet’s. That’s beauty with benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 21 looked at use of e-cigarettes among young people and later cigarette smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/"&gt;Tobacco Control&lt;/a&gt;, the authors said the data available 'consistently indicated a significant association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said it was difficult to 'infer causality' from their review, but the 'repeated strong associations in prospective cohort studies are consistent with a causal relationship'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also&lt;span&gt; suggested an increased risk among young people who vape of developing asthma or asthma exacerbation, they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other harmful outcomes linked to youth vaping included pneumonia, bronchitis, lower total sperm counts, dizziness, headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was also a link identified between depression and suicidal thoughts among young vapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Su Golder, associate professor in health science at the University of York, said: 'The consistency in the evidence is striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Greg Hartwell, clinical assistant professor at LSHTM, said: 'We found consistent evidence around transitions to smoking which of course, in turn, opens the door to the multitude of harms that conventional cigarettes bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the UK Government's chief medical officer states, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12316343/Disposable-vapes-restricted-like-tobacco-order-clamp-UKs-kid-e-cig-epidemic-senior-Tory-MP-claims.html"&gt;marketing vapes to children&lt;/a&gt; is always unacceptable, and our review shows exactly why further restrictions on the tobacco industry, who control the vaping market, are so important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Glover, senior author of the study, assistant professor at LSHTM, added: 'Vaping is having a detrimental impact on the health of young people globally and vaping appears to be a gateway to other substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study provides the strongest evidence to date that young people globally face a serious range of physical and psychological harms from vaping and are at higher risk of transitioning to smoking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other experts today, who weren't involved in the research, labelled the findings 'overspeculation' and warned the studies analysed were observational or low quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Ann McNeill, an expert in tobacco addiction at King College &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-536ffe90-7d11-11f0-96e6-590b241915e8"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'It reported on 56 systematic reviews of which 53 were rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The authors reported that the reviews found consistently that vaping was associated with subsequent smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This replicates the findings of many previous reviews and indeed research I have been involved in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Campaigners have long blamed predatory manufacturers for the ever-growing crisis, claiming they are intentionally luring kids in with colourful packaging, compared to highlighter pens, and child-friendly flavours such as bubblegum and cotton candy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the authors incorrectly state that this supports "a causal relationship". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'in other words that vaping causes smoking—the so-called 'gateway' effect. It is well-established that consistency does not mean causality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;span&gt;Dr Emma Beard, an associate professor in statistics and quantitative methods at University College London, said: 'The conclusion that vaping acts as a "gateway" is an overspeculation, especially when the paper notes that at a population level, smoking rates have generally fallen as vaping has risen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'While protecting youth is vital, this review clearly shows the current evidence base on this topic has some significant weaknesses.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigs allow people to inhale nicotine in a vapour—which is produced by heating a liquid, which typically contains propylene glycol, glycerine, flavourings, and other chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike traditional cigarettes, they do not contain tobacco, nor do they produce tar or carbon—two of the most dangerous elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicotine's effect on the brain is well known—within 20 seconds of inhalation, it triggers the release of chemical messengers such as dopamine, associated with reward and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it also increases heart rate and blood pressure and makes blood vessels constrict. This is because nicotine triggers the release of the hormone adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7d2499e0-cd16-11ef-b756-1d55513ec566"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; chiefs insisting it is safer than smoking, vaping is not risk-free. E-cigarettes can contain harmful toxins and their long-term effects remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are also concerned the high nicotine content might increase blood pressure and cause other heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, in world-first guidance setting out possible interventions to help people stop using tobacco products, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13592791/World-Health-Organizations-war-vapes-continues-body-rules-devices-recommended-help-people-quit-smoking-contrary-NHS-advice.html"&gt;World Health Organization labelled the evidence&lt;/a&gt; around e-cigarettes as 'complex'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes could not be recommended as way to stop smoking as too little is known about the harms and benefits, the UN agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, in a bid to tackle the surge in youth vaping, it was made illegal for &lt;span&gt;businesses to sell or supply single-use vapes, such as Elf bars and Lost Mary, in shops and online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only devices considered reusable—with a rechargeable battery and replaceable coil—are now allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition where the body struggles to manage blood sugar levels.

With over 536 million people affected globally in 2021 (and that number expected to rise), diabetes is a growing concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of these conflicting results, a new meta-analysis was conducted to take a closer look and provide clearer answers. This study is one of the most thorough reviews to date, specifically examining how &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-benefits-8785974" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric and curcumin&lt;/a&gt; influence body measurements in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and the results were published in&lt;em&gt; Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers conducted a detailed review and analysis of studies to understand the effects of turmeric and curcumin on body measurements in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The reviewers carefully selected studies that met specific criteria, such as focusing on adults with prediabetes or diabetes and comparing turmeric/curcumin to a placebo. Studies on animals or pregnant women, as well as those combining turmeric with other treatments, were excluded. Twenty eligible articles were used for the systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the reevaluation of studies, the daily dose of turmeric or curcumin ranged from as low as 80 mg to as high as 2100 mg. The duration of these studies varied, too, lasting anywhere from eight weeks to 36 weeks. The interventions were categorized into three types: unformulated curcumin, high-absorption curcumin and turmeric. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 14 clinical trials studied the effects of turmeric or curcumin on body weight in people with type 2 diabetes. The combined results showed that turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to an average weight loss of 1.9 kg (or about 4.2 pounds) compared to the placebo. Additionally, participants with a body mass index (BMI) under 30 saw a greater weight reduction of 2.2 kg (about 4.8 pounds). These findings suggest turmeric may have an impact on weight management, especially in certain groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other findings included that among participants with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation modestly reduced waist and hip circumference, but had little effect on BMI and body fat percentage. As for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;people with prediabetes&lt;/a&gt;, three trials suggested that turmeric/curcumin supplements modestly reduced body weight when taken over 22 weeks, and turmeric/curcumin was also connected to a small reduction in waist circumference. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of turmeric and curcumin for managing body weight and measurements in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, it has some limitations. The quality of evidence in many of the included trials was rated as low or very low, partly due to inconsistencies in results and differences in study designs, doses and durations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the high variability between studies makes it harder to draw definitive conclusions. Most trials had small sample sizes, and some relied on self-reported data, which can introduce bias. Furthermore, the study excluded certain populations, such as pregnant women and those using turmeric alongside other treatments, limiting its generalizability. Finally, while turmeric and curcumin showed promise in some areas, the effects were often modest, highlighting that taking this supplement is unlikely to be a magic bullet for seeing noticeable outcomes for some. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re managing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, the idea of adding a turmeric or curcumin supplement to your routine might sound appealing, especially since it’s a natural and more budget-friendly option. The research suggests that turmeric could help with small but meaningful improvements in weight and waist size, particularly when taken in higher doses (over 1500 mg/day) or for longer periods (more than 22 weeks). That said, most turmeric or curcumin supplements usually have between 500 and 1,000 milligrams of curcumin per serving—and you should check in with a healthcare professional before taking a new supplement, especially one with a high dosage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, people with prediabetes saw an average weight loss of 2.5 kg (about 5.5 pounds) and a reduction in waist circumference of nearly 3 cm (about 1.2 inches). While these changes aren’t dramatic, they could be a helpful addition to a broader plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and regular medical care.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, turmeric isn’t a quick fix or a replacement for other treatments. Its effects are modest, and not everyone will see the same results. If you’re considering turmeric or curcumin supplements, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider first, especially if you’re already on medication for diabetes or other conditions. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-herbal-supplements-interfere-with-medications-8714553" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Supplements can interact with medications&lt;/a&gt;, and not all products are created equal. For example, some may not contain the right dose or form of curcumin to be effective. Ultimately, while turmeric shows promise, it works best as part of a well-rounded approach to managing diabetes and overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes,&lt;/em&gt; highlights the potential of turmeric as a natural, more budget-friendly supplement that may support weight management and reduce waist size in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. But it is important to remember that while the results are promising, the effects are modest and vary depending on factors like dosage, duration and individual health conditions. Turmeric is not a cure-all, but it could serve as a helpful addition to a comprehensive diabetes management plan that includes a healthy diet, regular exercise and medical care. For those looking for alternative ways to support their health, turmeric offers a safe and accessible option worth considering under the guidance of your healthcare provider.

The organization recommended children aged 6 months to 23 months should receive COVID-19 vaccines unless they have allergies to the ingredients.

&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that we're in a different place in the pandemic than we were four or five years ago in terms of risks to healthy older kids," Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases (COID) said in a statement. However, "the risk of hospitalization for young children and those with high-risk conditions remains pretty high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/02-MacNeil-COVID-508.pdf"&gt;According to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization in children under 2 is the highest among any pediatric group. Further, the rate of hospitalization among children 6 months to 23 months is comparable to that of adults ages 50 to 64. Critically, more than half of children aged 6 months to 23 months who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have no underlying medical condition that puts them at high risk for severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For children 2 to 18, the AAP recommends COVID-19 shots for children who have a medical condition that puts them at &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072788/202525/Hospitalization-for-COVID-19-and-Risk-Factors-for"&gt;high risk&lt;/a&gt;, are residents of care facilities, have never been vaccinated, or have household contacts who are high risk of severe COVID-19. All other children and teens should also have access to updated seasonal shots if they desire them, the AAP says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children, and adolescents," Kressly said. "Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families, and their communities healthy and thriving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coverage questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With school starting, COVID-19 cases ticking up around the country, and cold-weather respiratory virus season looming, the question now is how the conflicting recommendations will be interpreted by insurance companies. Insurers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC. But there is no such obligation for recommendations from medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP has been holding meetings with insurers to press for continued coverage of evidence-based vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Leary &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/19/kids-vaccines-american-academy-pediatrics-rfk-cdc/"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that insurers are "signaling that they are committed to covering our recommendations.” The Post also noted that AHIP, the major insurance lobby, released &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/health-plans-continued-commitment-to-vaccine-access"&gt;a statement in June&lt;/a&gt; saying its members are committed to "ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season."&lt;/p&gt;

Four to six cups of very hot liquids carried a 3.7-times higher risk of the cancer, and six to eight cups was associated with 4.8-fold increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For hot beverages, up to four cups a day carried an increased risk of 1.6 times. Four to six cups a day was associated with an increased cancer risk of two times; six to eight cups carried a 2.5-fold higher risk; and more than eight was associated with a three-times higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings, published in the British Journal of Cancer, build on previous research that suggests beverages at very hot temperatures, more than 149 degrees Fahrenheit, are 'probably carcinogenic to humans'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ideal brewing temperature for coffee is generally between 195 to 205F. For tea, the optimal brewing temperature varies by type, but is often around 175 to 212F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This places hot beverages in the same risk category as things like emissions from indoor wood smoke or consuming high amounts of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your daily coffee habit could increase your risk of cancer by up to nearly sixfold, startling research suggests (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, people typically drink coffee and tea at slightly cooler temperatures, often between 120 to 155F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed that hot drinks might cause damage to the body by burning cells, which may lead to inflammation that damages genes and makes it more likely that cancer develops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vincent Ho, associate professor and clinical academic gastroenterologist at Western Sydney University, wrote for The Conversation: 'Drinking a lot of very hot drinks can damage cells in the esophagus lining, and it’s believed over time this can lead to cancer developing. Researchers first proposed this link almost 90 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we know about how hot drinks can damage the esophagus mainly comes from animal studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another theory is that heat damage to the esophagus lining weakens its normal barrier, increasing the risk of further damage from gastric acid reflux (from the stomach). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Over time, this chronic damage can increase the chance of esophageal cancer developing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also thought that tissues damaged by the hot liquids may become more vulnerable to other things that can cause cancer, like alcohol and chemicals in tobacco smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team at the National Cancer Institute stated that 'individuals who like their beverages very hot might benefit from reducing the temperature of their drinks, at least with regards to their risk of esophageal cancer'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year, experts predict more than 22,000 new esophageal cancer cases will be diagnosed with just over 16,000 deaths from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer starts at the inside lining of the esophagus and spreads outward through the other layers as it grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms often include difficulty swallowing, unintended weight loss, and chest pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms can be subtle at first but tend to worsen as the cancer progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other possible symptoms include a persistent cough, hoarseness, and heartburn that gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This year, experts predict more than 22,000 new esophageal cancer cases will be diagnosed with just over 16,000 deaths from the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there aren't routine screening tests for esophageal cancer, various procedures can help diagnose it, including endoscopy with biopsy, imaging scans, and specialized tests like the Cytosponge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endoscopy allows for direct visualization and tissue sampling, while imaging helps determine the extent of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cytosponge, a newer test, involves swallowing a sponge to collect cells for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes, healthcare providers can do surgery to remove small tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because only 25 percent of people with this cancer receive a diagnosis before the cancer spreads, it can make it more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer poses a challenge for early diagnosis because it often doesn't present with noticeable symptoms until the cancer has reached an advanced stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Late diagnosis significantly increases the danger of esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Localized esophageal cancer (stage I) has a five-year survival rate of around 46 percent, while stage IV cancers, which have spread to distant organs, have a very low five-year survival rate of only about five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A majority of Americans consume hot drinks daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that around two thirds drink coffee daily, making it the most popular hot beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to one study in 2018, the ideal temperature for drinking coffee, taking into account both the risk of esophageal injury and the preservation of flavor, was found to be approximately 136F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said this temperature allows for a pleasant drinking experience while minimizing potential harm to the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Offering some other tips to safe drinking, Professor Ho adds: 'Slow down, take your time and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Allowing time for a very hot drink to cool is important and research has shown a hot drink’s temperature can drop by 50F to 59F in five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Finally, small sips are a good idea to test the temperature, given we know having a large amount has a significant impact on the temperature inside the esophagus and potential damage to its lining.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers have identified seven molecules in the blood linked to excessive daytime sleepiness, including factors related to diet and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Approximately one in three Americans reports experiencing overwhelming drowsiness during the day—a condition known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/excessive+daytime+sleepiness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;excessive daytime sleepiness&lt;/a&gt; (EDS). EDS is linked to an increased risk of serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center identifies several molecules in the blood, known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt;, that are linked to EDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that risk of the condition may be influenced by both internal body processes, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hormone+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hormone levels&lt;/a&gt;, and external factors such as diet. Results are published in &lt;i&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests diet and genetics may play an important role in EDS," said lead author Tariq Faquih, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we learn what's happening biologically, we are beginning to understand how and why EDS occurs, the early signs that someone might have it, and what we can do to help patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected data on 877 metabolites, naturally occurring molecules in the body influenced by diet and hormones. The team used &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from 6,000 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The team also used data from a questionnaire that assesses how often a person dozes off during the day in various scenarios. The team replicated the findings in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study and studies in the UK and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They identified seven metabolites associated with EDS. An additional three metabolites were identified that varied by sex. The team found that omega-3 and omega-6 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+acids/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are commonly found in foods that make up Mediterranean-like diets, were associated with lower risk of EDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other metabolites, such as tyramine, which is found in fermented and overripe foods, were associated with increased daytime sleepiness, particularly in men. Sex steroid metabolites, such as progesterone, were associated with sleep-related processes such as melatonin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that the results suggest potential treatment targets for EDS and that dietary changes or medications may lead to better treatment. They also note some limitations to the study, including difficulty in interpreting exact values of metabolites and using a sleep questionnaire instead of bringing participants into a sleep lab for tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future directions could include conducting a clinical trial to see if &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+changes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary changes&lt;/a&gt; or supplements can help reduce daytime sleepiness. Additionally, the authors identified some unknown metabolites that they plan to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Conducting a clinical trial would be a big next step and could help us understand if omega-3s and omega-6s obtained from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; could help lower risk of EDS," said Faquih.&lt;/p&gt;

It said sufferers may “regularly nap during the day, fall asleep during the day [and] still sleep for long hours at night”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One study with European participants, which was published in the journal EBioMedicine, estimated that just under one in five people experience sleepiness levels that are significantly above normal several days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Tariq Faquih, of the sleep and circadian disorders division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, the author of the study, said: “The metabolites we’ve identified can certainly be measured with the appropriate tools. We anticipate they’ll be most valuable following an initial assessment, ideally using sleep-lab testing or, at minimum, standardised questionnaires. Testing the metabolite levels will help determine which metabolites may require adjustment, for example through dietary interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Faquih said if people were concerned, they could take online questionnaires or use screening tools such as the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snorers-have-you-been-tested-for-sleep-apnoea-yet-g88x9jjdn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt; before contacting their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/foods-keep-you-younger-gvldm2wq7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;From peanuts to pomegranates — the 19 foods that will keep you young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When asked about the symptoms of EDS, he said: “Some may feel constantly drowsy throughout the day, while others might experience sudden and intense sleepiness that leads to unexpected ‘sleep attacks’. In other cases, people may unintentionally fall asleep during quiet, repetitive activities like watching TV or reading. It is not always as sudden but still happens without us meaning to go to sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “Our study suggests diet and genetics may play an important role in EDS. As we learn what’s happening biologically, we are beginning to understand how and why EDS occurs, the early signs that someone might have it and what we can do to help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To combat excessive daytime sleepiness, it could be beneficial to consume more food high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• Fatty fish&lt;br&gt;• Nuts&lt;br&gt;• Seeds&lt;br&gt;• Vegetable oils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And for people, particularly men, to eat less food high in tyramine, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• Fermented and pickled food&lt;br&gt;• Over-ripe food&lt;br&gt;• Aged cheese&lt;br&gt;• Smoked meat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers found associations with other harmful consequences including asthma, cough, injuries and mental ill health, as well as possible risks of respiratory disease, headaches, poor oral health and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Su Golder, an associate professor in health science at the University of York and an author of the research, said: “The consistency in the evidence is striking. Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Ronny Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cheung urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiled &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/resources/view/use-of-e-cigarettes-among-young-people-in-great-britain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;by Action on Smoking and Health&lt;/a&gt; this year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the levels in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who do not vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/29/third-of-uk-teenagers-who-vape-will-go-on-to-start-smoking-research-shows" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan established that a third of UK teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/smoking" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt; and Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond the scope of the data”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added: “The associations demonstrated are both extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Dunne, UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to stop demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of smoking-related illnesses every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and non-smokers should never vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The worrying rise in youth vaping requires attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQOW5rZGpYR2NXTjVveFh1N3ZIaUFKVWJUNW1oQVgxMDlHT295LUtsUFdFZ1QxN2pkMzBGUnN4MFRXaDBhVVFSVERJSmFPQldhWFlsV0hoZ2drNHN6djZOaWJEWl9VM1VCbURNT0RwRzRfNFpVUVhNekxCVTh6akU2VkJ2bUJ4NzdyZndqRWE2emZNcWhtZmNYS0d0V3BCN3NHNVVrS3Bwck1tbDQ0MUE</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性- KOLO | 8新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQektSVGZwaHJ0VEY1TU1TUVhPZHVWcy11VWZYQ2xyQTZDWlZ4Y2htaWVRSEpwNXR6M3ZtcEFjcVIyY2tYaklpMWtjblphTE5UUE04TThrcm90S3doWS1rdVh5Q1FfWFZrRFJ3MXhpOFJKVVIyU2dGeDhMZnV1Vmg2Y3ctZUtXdGxoa0HSAZ4BQVVfeXFMT2ZNWUJ5NjlmUjBjVXZ1aHFMY3F4ZWdRMlZkRkJ0czdjQnBhSmNhN3dWWjVrbUswR2FFTWxhcENPMHQxTkx4QzV2eDg3Mks2eHlubFBwSHcwUmJwaGphd2VKR2RGbkpHdHpxdVhDUFkzR2FWUmp4VDlmbVE3ZTduWWEzRlkxQ0N3WGpsbEgzQlhKRF95ZUNqMktDQ3hDUnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, California (KOLO) - A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;El Dorado County health officials say the unidentified resident is under the care of a medical professional and is recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say they believe the person may have been bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. Health officials are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County, said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s Acting Director of Public Health. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The bacteria that causes the plague, Yersinia pestis, is most often transmitted by the bite of fleas that have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks, and other wild rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms typically show up within two weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea. Symptoms include fever, nausea, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics if detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Prior to this case, the most recent case came in 2020, with the patient likely being infected in the South Lake Tahoe area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials say you should never feed squirrels, touch injured or dead rodents, and never allow your pets to play with sick, injured or dead rodents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KOLO.

Ideally, it would inform adult education programs that would seek to increase skills with demonstrable effects on quality of life. “People who have literacy and numeracy skills at lower levels often must develop alternative strategies for obtaining and acting on the information they need,” Jeff Fantine, executive director of the National Coalition for Literacy, &lt;a href="https://www.proliteracy.org/news/us-adults-need-stronger-skills-to-thrive-in-a-changing-world/" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; ProLiteracy. “When they take advantage of adult education to improve their skills, their self-efficacy increases because they are able to handle such tasks independently. But often these adults are not aware of educational opportunities that are available to them, so we must increase awareness of, expand access to, and build capacity for adult education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-23" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cw"&gt;Is there any correlation between PIAAC’s assessments and a ranking of the states based on their education programs?

Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-glucose" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is glucose?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Any form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread, is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten, Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because their bodies have &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/diabetes-and-insulin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trouble making or using insulin&lt;/a&gt; – the hormone created by the pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to make energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat, physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the reference range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-cgms-do" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do CGMs do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with diabetes previously had to use a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a relatively new device that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/continuous-glucose-monitors-cgms-for-type-2-diabetes-when-and-for-whom-are-they-useful" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;uses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid between cells every few minutes&lt;/a&gt; and then sends the reading to a receiver or smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-people-who-dont-have-diabetes" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What about people who don’t have diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gunton, who heads the Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Obesity and Endocrinology Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-people-without-diabetes-use-them" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Should people without diabetes use them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2022 found CGMs &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/33/2/article-p121.xml" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;provide little benefit for healthy athletes without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Separately, researchers who &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dme.15369" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;analysed the available evidence&lt;/a&gt; of the utility of CMGs among people not living with diabetes in 2024 said that due to the lack of evidence, “we urge for the commercial claims suggesting the utility of the device in [this population] to be labelled as misleading”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="32647e94-ea2b-4d80-8168-eb3615d3e3a3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is hair and scalp oiling, and will it make my locks long like Rapunzel? | Antiviral","elementId":"32647e94-ea2b-4d80-8168-eb3615d3e3a3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/09/hair-oiling-scalp-what-is-it-good-for-hair-benefits-fact-check"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Willer welcomes people trying to understand how their body works, but says any idea of a “magic number” for glucose levels for someone who doesn’t have insulin resistance or diabetes is “completely imaginary”. She also says it could lead people to becoming unnecessarily restrictive with their diet and trying to control their body in a way that is not necessarily healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a bit like calorie counting, in that it’s one metric that can give people the impression that it kind of wraps everything up together, that it is an indicator for everything. But just like calorie counting, it is actually hugely reductionistic, and it means that we lose so much context about why we eat, when we eat, the sorts of things we eat, and how food functions in our social and cultural experiences as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Willer recommends for people who are interested in living a healthier lifestyle and want an individual approach to speak to a health expert rather than buy a product online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if they have purchased a CGM, a dietitian or another health professional will help understand, to help them interpret what’s going on with their numbers against their actual behaviours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Antiviral&lt;/a&gt; is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="19b58638-5ce7-4089-89d7-fa8753b97765" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"19b58638-5ce7-4089-89d7-fa8753b97765","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

In response, the city will conduct mosquito spraying Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, officials announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most infections are asymptomatic, West Nile can cause serious complications, particularly in older adults, people who are immunocompromised, and those with underlying health conditions. Most infections cause no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20% of patients develop West Nile fever, a flu-like illness with fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and rashes. Approximately 1 in 150 people infected with West Nile virus develop neuroinvasive disease, which can cause severe illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, 15 people have been diagnosed with neuroinvasive West Nile this year, according to LDH’s most recent surveillance report dated Aug. 9, with cases reported in Caddo, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Livingston, Ouachita, St. Tammany and Washington parishes. The first case in New Orleans &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/new-orleans-west-nile-neuroinvasive/article_8837c547-e2c9-4640-a70a-3f041c94695a.html" target="_blank"&gt;was reported Aug. 8&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito monitoring has also detected widespread virus activity. More than 745 mosquito pools have tested positive for West Nile across Louisiana in 2025, including over 200 in Orleans Parish. That marks an increase from last year, when 617 pools statewide — and four in New Orleans — tested positive. Louisiana ultimately recorded three deaths from the virus in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Nile transmittal is temperature dependent, said &lt;span&gt;said Kevin Caillouet, director of the St. Tammany Parish Mosquito Abatement District. The virus multiplies faster in hotter weather, which may be why there is an uptick. By July, St. Tammany was tracking about three times the West Nile activity as usual. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The warmer it gets, the quicker they can transmit," Caillouet said. "And that causes an exponential amplification of these viruses in these mosquitoes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it spreads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus circulates between wild birds and mosquitoes, and can infect humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. In New Orleans, the primary carrier is the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, which thrives in polluted water in ditches, storm drains and aging septic systems. The species is most active after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus was first detected in Louisiana in 2002 and has since become the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States, typically peaking during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spray timing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of New Orleans Mosquito, Termite and Rodent Control Board scheduled spray missions for Tuesday night by truck between the hours of 8:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. in Central City, Milan, Touro, the Garden District, Uptown/Carrollton, the Fourteenth Ward, Broadmoor, Hoffman Triangle, Mid-City, Bayou St. John, Tremé/Lafitte, Fairgrounds and the Seventh Ward.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday morning, the city will spray larvicide by helicopter into standing water between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. The larvicide is a naturally occurring bacterial product that kills mosquito larvae without harming people, pets or bees, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target areas include English Turn, Old Aurora, Brechtel Park Behrman and Whitney. The helicopter will also do surveillance in other areas to identify more places mosquitoes could be breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Protecting against bites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials are urging residents to use EPA-approved repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus; limit outdoor activities between dusk and dawn; and eliminate standing water around homes where mosquitoes can breed. Even the small amount of water that fills a bottle cap can be enough for mosquitoes to lay eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Residents can report mosquito problems by calling 311, filing a request at &lt;a href="http://nola311.org"&gt;nola311.org&lt;/a&gt;, emailing &lt;a href="mailto:mosquitocontrol@nola.gov"&gt;mosquitocontrol@nola.gov&lt;/a&gt;, or calling (504) 658-2400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, can be achieved with foods high in fiber and protein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep in mind, a boiled egg provides 7 grams of protein and is the most complete whole protein-based food,” she explained. “I always encourage whole foods first.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carnahan advised people to focus on foods “in their whole state,” which include apples, bananas, carrot sticks, nuts and seeds, natural peanut butter, and plain Greek yogurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These are all great foods that just take a little planning and are easy to consume with little preparation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data shows that more than half of daily calories in the UK and the US come from

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;cientists recently discovered a microbe with one of the tiniest genomes on Earth. More surprising, the creature is almost entirely dependent on its host: Its genes don’t support any of the functions of metabolism, one of the key processes of life. As such, it challenges fundamental notions of what it means to be a living organism.&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery was “pure serendipity,” says Takuro Nakayama, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Takayama wanted to study the many microbes that live within a single-celled marine dinoflagellate, &lt;em&gt;Citharistes regius&lt;/em&gt;, a kind of plankton. But when he and his colleagues sequenced the genes of this microbial community, they kept turning up tiny, odd chunks of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these DNA chunks belong to some unusual archaea—a branch on the tree of life populated by single-celled microbes that can often survive in extreme environments. (Archaea are similar to bacteria, but distinct in their structure, genetics, and metabolism.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakayama and his colleagues proposed the name Sukunaarchaeum mirabile for the newly-discovered microbe: Sukunaarchaeum after the Japanese dwarf deity &lt;em&gt;Sukuna-biko-na&lt;/em&gt;, and mirabile for marvelous. At only 238,000 base pairs, the number of genes in the DNA of Sukunaarchaeum is smaller than that of any other known archaea. The scientists described &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651781v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;their finding&lt;/a&gt; in a bioRxiv preprint earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome? Over the course of evolution, genetic instructions for life often become increasingly complex. But evolution can also go in the other direction, leading to greater simplicity in the genome. This so-called genomic reduction, where organisms end up with fewer genes than their ancestors, is typically observed in the domains of bacteria and archaea. What struck Nakayama and his colleagues about Sukunaarchaeum was the extent of reduction and specialization in its genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its stripped down genome, Sukunaarchaeum appears to be completely dependent on its host, &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt;, for essential energy and nutrients. “It likely cannot produce its own cellular building blocks,” notes Nakayama. “No previously discovered microbe has shown such an extreme degree of metabolic dependence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sukunaarchaeum seems to almost inhabit a new category of life, suspended somewhere between archaea and virus. It is like viruses—which aren’t typically considered to be “alive”—in that it has a tiny genome and is totally dependent on its host for metabolism. But unlike a virus, Sukunaarchaeum has its own ribosomes, cellular structures that synthesize proteins, and it can replicate itself without the help of a host.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of just how unusual Sukunaarchaeum is, the researchers decided to scan the oceans for potential relatives. They analyzed environmental genetic sequence data from marine environments all over the world, focusing on spots where &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt; is known to live. Using a database called the Tara Oceans project, they discovered a vast array of sequences that are comparable to that of Sukunaarchaeum, which they hypothesize could represent a new, deeply branching archaeal lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nakayama, this additional finding suggests that many more microbes that challenge the definition of life may be out there, living in what Nakayama calls “microbial dark matter,” or microbes that can’t be cultivated in the lab. “The extreme, virus-like lifestyle we hypothesize for Sukunaarchaeum is a perfect example of the surprising outcomes found in this ‘natural laboratory of evolution,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mart Krupovic, a virologist and microbiologist at Institut Pasteur in France who wasn’t involved in the study, called the finding “remarkable.” Krupovic has studied giant viruses that, like Sukunaarchaeum, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.18624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;defy categorization&lt;/a&gt;. These giant viruses have evolved larger and more complex genomes that include some of the genes for DNA translation, a characteristic thought to be reserved for cellular life. “I think that is fascinating,” says Krupovic, “how little we still know about the world which surrounds us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Nakayama wants to culture and isolate Sukunaarchaeum in the lab, not just its genes, and take an image or video of it. He hopes this will help him better understand its biology, ecology, and how it is built—how it achieves this curious feat of living on the edge of life. &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
