I would get pain in my neck and behind my ear on the left side. I could have prosecco and sometimes it would hurt and sometimes it wouldn't. I could have lager and it wouldn't hurt but with wine it would really, really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, Thursby found herself feeling very itchy and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I'd been shattered for a long time,” she told the outlet. "I was unbearably tired, I would need to have a nap during the day which is not particularly normal… I complained that I was having really, really itchy skin.

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thursby said she thought the fatigue was simply due to her being a busy mom with a toddler and newborn baby at home. But in January 2025, she decided to see a doctor.  However, when she mentioned her symptoms, she said doctors “blamed it on her hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I listened to what the GP said and obviously didn't think anything else of it,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Months later, Thursby returned to her doctor after discovering a lump on her neck. They ultimately sent her for a CT scan and biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In October 2025, she received the “heartbreaking” diagnosis of stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/hodgkin-lymphoma/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, which can cause pain when drinking, fever, night sweats and feelings of lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I spoke to the blood cancer doctor, she said she's been working for 17 years and has only seen it one other time,” Thursby said. “But pain when you drink alcohol is actually a known side effect of Hodgkin lymphoma. 'It's something about the acidity in the wine and not when you drink other alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollie Thursby undergoing chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In November, Thrusby, a primary school teacher, started chemotherapy to treat her cancer, which she’ll continue in the coming months. After losing her mother to a blood disorder as a child, she told the outlet she’s now worried about not being in her own children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Not being able to look after the boys is the worst thing about it all,” she said. “I'm worried that I'm dying and that I'm going to leave them. I can't leave them without a mammy. I grew up without a mum and it was horrendous, I can't do that to the boys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the unknown, Thursby said she has a lot of support and is trying to stay optimistic now that she has a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We're all devastated but we all know now and we've got a treatment plan, which is what we need,” she said. “I'm just doing everything I can to get better for them.

Usually, if you stop exposing yourself to the heat, the rash will slowly fade away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"But if you keep slow roasting yourself, it can actually cause damage to your skin and blood vessels and make that rash permanent. And in some cases, its even been linked to skin &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A lot of people presume they'd be left with a burn rather than a rash covering their skin if exposed to a direct source of heat, but that isn't the case with toasted skin syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Toni Golen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, explained why in an &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-toasted-skin-syndrome"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for Harvard Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The level of heat that triggers the rash isn’t high enough to burn you, but it can dilate superficial blood vessels under the skin," she said. That’s what causes the skin to discolour over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For those who might have been left with the strange rash after taking their hot water bottle sessions a bit too far this winter, Dr Golen suggested cooling it for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Exposing your skin to direct heat when using items such as a hot water bottle can cause the rash (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Lower the setting of your electric blanket or heating pad, or limit how long you use it," the doctor said. "If your laptop is the problem, place a lap desk or other buffer between it and your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The rash should fade over weeks. If it doesn’t, see your doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As Dr Golen mentioned, it really is important to check in with your GP if this rash doesn't disappear - as it might have triggered something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/toasted-skin-syndrome#complications"&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; Healthline have warned that exposing your skin to a heat source for long periods can sometimes 'cause more dramatic changes in your skin cells that can develop into other conditions, including cancer'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It states: "The types of cancer that are associated with toasted skin syndrome include: squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous lymphoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"While cancer isn’t a common complication of toasted skin syndrome, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about any skin changes you notice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But if you want to avoid putting yourself at risk of toasted skin syndrome altogether, it sounds like simply sticking another layer on to stay warm might be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:25:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPYVZrZVRDWHpTOXdoSG01VUV2T00td3VQS3ZTT3hfQUNEZy1iNkxUSG8ya1h2NXluOXBfMWgxNUdEMTJ2QWpqNk1RbXN2M3JBeVZ5YzZ3MzF1djJNcjZvcjhmY2lMbV9qMmNZM1pFbzlzZ1FPa0tyc0ZvRmYwWThGVVRlYmk0T3lQWG5VVWFqOWZVY01aejNMdk43bFpuQlM5X1dIa3d0aTJOWWV6Wm5ORA</guid></item><item><title>这个可爱的好男孩刚刚接受了罕见的挽救生命的脑部手术- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-adorable-good-boy-just-got-rare-life-saving-brain-surgery-2000712485</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A six-year-old dog named Woody has just earned a new lease on life, thanks to a rare type of brain surgery performed by veterinarians in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surgeons at DoveLewis Animal Hospital conducted the surgery to remove a tumor in Woody’s skull. The complicated procedure took several hours to complete but was a success. And Woody has since recuperated well enough to get back to his daily walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The post-op recovery really takes a whole lot of people to work together, and watching him very closely, and to have a [committed] owner have the team to support his post-op and have him coming back for a recheck all these are necessary components for his success of outcome,” John Du, a neurosurgeon at DoveLewis, &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/dog-recovers-from-rare-complex-brain-surgery-at-portland-animal-hospital-dovelewis-dogs-veterinary-medicine"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; local media outlet KATU Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Rare and complex&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000712583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2000712583 size-medium" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg" alt="Woodytumor" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg 189w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-720x1280.jpg 720w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-378x672.jpg 378w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-540x960.jpg 540w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-900x1600.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;© DoveLewis Veterinary Emergency &amp;amp; Specialty Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woody’s owners first suspected something was wrong with Woody last summer when he began stumbling on stairs and hesitating before jumps. By November, doctors at DoveLewis had identified the cause: a bone tumor pressing up against his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Brain surgeries are some of the hardest procedures to perform in humans, and they can be even more challenging in dogs. The brain and skull structure of a dog can vary dramatically depending on its breed, and dogs &lt;a href="https://news.cvm.ncsu.edu/nc-state-neurologist-adapts-human-laser-therapy-for-use-in-dogs-with-brain-cancer/#:~:text=Another%20challenge%20was,through%20this%20muscle.%E2%80%9D"&gt;tend&lt;/a&gt; to have thicker muscles on their head than humans do, further complicating any incisions. So the surgery that saved Woody’s life was no easy feat, according to his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The major risk we were worried about was the tumor was very close to a few major blood vessels around the skull and it took about four to six hours, I believe, in total to be removed safely,” Du told KATU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the procedure—which included rebuilding part of Woody’s skull with a titanium mesh—went well without any serious hitches. Woody was carefully monitored afterward but was on his feet and able to go back home by day three. Now he’s back to his old self, walking every day and playing with his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Woody’s tumor isn’t completely gone, unfortunately, but his doctors say it’s a slow-growing tumor. With ongoing monitoring and care, the family is hopeful that Woody will have many more years of life left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only complex canine surgery that doctors at DoveLewis have performed as of late. Last March, they successfully &lt;a href="https://www.dovelewis.org/blog/tubas-battle-brain-tumor-story-expert-care-and-family-love"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; a large brain tumor from Tuba, a 7-year-old Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some older folks seem to radiate joy while others appear weighed down by their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week at the farmers' market where I volunteer, I watched a 74-year-old vendor practically dance between the stalls, cracking jokes with customers and helping younger vendors lift heavy crates. Meanwhile, his friend, roughly the same age, sat hunched on a bench complaining about everything from the weather to his knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the difference? After years of observing and talking with the happiest seniors I know, I've discovered it's not about luck or genetics. The vibrant ones all share certain daily habits that keep their spirits high and their outlook fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't complicated rituals or expensive treatments. They're simple, intentional choices anyone can make. And the best part? You don't have to wait until you're 70 to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They move their bodies every single morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, "Of course exercise is on this list." But here's what surprised me: the happiest seniors don't necessarily do intense workouts. They just move, consistently, first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 78-year-old I know starts each day with a 15-minute walk around her block. Rain or shine. Another does gentle stretches while his coffee brews. A third tends her garden before breakfast, bending and reaching as she checks on her tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key isn't the type of movement but the timing. Morning movement sets a positive tone for the entire day. As someone who runs trails most mornings, I can vouch for this. Even on days when I only manage a quick walk, that early movement shifts my whole mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up too. Studies show that morning exercise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432823005090"&gt;boosts mood-regulating neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; for hours afterward. But more than science, it's about starting the day by honoring your body instead of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They practice gratitude without making it a chore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to roll my eyes at gratitude practices. Seemed too woo-woo for my analytical brain. Then I started keeping an evening gratitude journal, mostly out of curiosity, and something shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older people I know have mastered this art. But they don't make it complicated. One gentleman tells me he thinks of three good things while brushing his teeth each night. Another writes one sentence in a notebook she keeps on her nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is how specific they get. Not just "grateful for family" but "grateful for my granddaughter's giggle when she saw the butterfly today." This specificity trains the brain to notice small joys throughout the day, knowing you'll want to remember them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They maintain real connections, not just Facebook friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something interesting: the happiest seniors I meet aren't necessarily the ones with the most friends. They're the ones who nurture a handful of deep connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 72-year-old regular at the farmers' market told me she has coffee with the same three friends every Tuesday. They've been meeting for 15 years. Another couple in their late 70s hosts a monthly potluck where the same six people always show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality beats quantity every time. These folks pick up the phone instead of just texting. They show up in person when someone needs help. They remember birthdays and anniversaries without Facebook reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize recently, we found boxes of handwritten letters from friends spanning decades. That kind of connection takes effort, but it pays dividends in happiness and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They learn something new without pressure to master it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old who just started learning Spanish isn't trying to become fluent. The 71-year-old taking pottery classes isn't aiming to sell her work. They're learning for the sheer joy of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach to learning keeps the brain flexible and curious. But more importantly, it maintains that childlike wonder that makes life feel fresh instead of repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman told me she picks a new topic each month to explore through library books and YouTube videos. Last month was birds of prey. This month it's the history of jazz. She'll never be an expert in any of these areas, and that's precisely the point. The joy is in the exploration, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They have a purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every happy senior I know contributes to something larger than their own life. For some, it's volunteering. For others, it's mentoring younger people in their former profession. Many care for grandchildren or tend community gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weekly volunteer shift at the farmers' market connects me with several retirees who show up religiously to help set up tents and educate customers about local produce. One 76-year-old told me, "Retirement without purpose is just waiting around. I need to know I'm still useful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of purpose doesn't have to be grand. It could be as simple as being the neighbor who waters plants when others travel, or the person who organizes the building's recycling program. What matters is feeling needed and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They protect their sleep like gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older adults I know treat sleep as sacred, not negotiable. They have bedtime routines they stick to religiously. They skip late-night TV binges. They say no to evening events that would disrupt their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly vibrant 73-year-old told me she's been going to bed at 9:30 PM and waking at 5:30 AM for the past decade. "People think I'm missing out on nightlife," she laughed. "But I'm gaining energy for the life that actually matters to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep becomes even more crucial as we age. It affects everything from mood to memory to physical recovery. The seniors who prioritize it consistently report feeling younger and more energetic than their sleep-deprived peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They laugh at themselves regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice I didn't say they're always happy or positive. The healthiest seniors I know experience the full range of emotions. But they've mastered the art of not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they forget someone's name, they laugh about their "senior moment" instead of panicking about cognitive decline. When they struggle with new technology, they joke about being dinosaurs rather than feeling ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-deprecating humor serves a purpose beyond entertainment. It releases tension, connects them with others, and keeps perfectionism at bay. Speaking of perfectionism, finding my old report cards while helping my parents move reminded me how exhausting it is to take yourself too seriously all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They say no without guilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the most powerful habit of all. Happy seniors have earned the right to be selective with their time and energy, and they use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decline invitations that don't excite them. They refuse to babysit when they're tired. They skip family drama they don't want to engage with. And they do it all without lengthy explanations or apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 70-year-old told me, "I spent 50 years saying yes to everything. Now I only say yes to what brings me joy or truly helps someone I love. Everything else gets a polite no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't selfishness. It's self-preservation. By protecting their energy for what truly matters, they have more to give when they do say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father had his heart attack at 68, it shook me to my core. Watching him recover, I saw firsthand how daily habits can make the difference between merely surviving and truly thriving in our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about these eight habits? You can start them at any age. I'm in my forties and already practicing most of them. They've made me happier now, not just preparing me for a happier future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seniors who seem to have cracked the code on aging joyfully aren't lucky or special. They've simply figured out that feeling young has less to do with denying age and more to do with engaging fully with each day. They move, connect, learn, contribute, rest, laugh, and choose. Every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you picked just one of these habits to start tomorrow? My guess is you'd feel a little younger by next week.&lt;/p&gt;

The amount of microorganisms that were transmitted between babies grew throughout the year. After four months, the babies at a nursery already shared 15–20% of their microbial species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was higher than the proportion of all the microbes that they had acquired from birth until that point from the family,” says Nicola Segata, a microbiologist at the University of Trento in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes in the children’s microbiomes will be due to the diet they had at the nurseries, but the study shows that the transmission of microbial strains between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions at this stage being key to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;building a diverse, healthy microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, adds Segata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bug transmission&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a fetus is still in the uterus, its microbiome is thought to be non-existent in healthy pregnancies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it starts to develop quickly after birth&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, mainly through&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; microbial transmission from the mother&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03804-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03804-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people who live together start to share microbial strains&lt;/a&gt;. But, how the developing microbiota changes over the first few years of life hasn’t been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill the knowledge gap, Segata and his colleagues examined the microbiomes of 43 babies with a median age of 10 months at the start of the study. They followed them before, during, and after they attended their first year of nursery in Trento, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We enrolled babies that were meeting for the first time, on the first day of the day care,” says Segata. “This is a time window in which their gut is much more prone to acquire strains from other babies and from adults, because the immune system isn’t yet well trained.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03449-4" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00178-8/d41586-026-00178-8_50903796.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;‘Poo milkshake’ boosts the microbiome of c-section babies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analysed faecal sample from the babies, as well as 10 nursery staff and individuals who lived in the same homes as the children: 39 mothers, 30 fathers, 7 siblings, 3 dogs and 2 cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the infants started nursery, the researchers continued to take samples every week until the Christmas break, and for some infants this continued until July. All participants had follow-up samples taken in July and a year after the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Microbial richness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission just one month after the infants started nursery, which continued to grow over the nursery year. If a baby had a sibling, they received more microbes from the sibling than they did from their parents, they tended to have a more diverse microbiota overall, and they acquired fewer bacterial strains from nursery peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also mapped transmission of individual microbial species between individuals. Segata gives an example of what happened with a strain of bacteria called &lt;i&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/i&gt;. “We have an example of a strain jumping from a mother to the infant. The baby at the day care then transmitted it to another baby, who transmitted it to both its parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Immunocompromised NSG mice were used as recipients for either subcutaneous, orthotopic or intravenous transplantation of &lt;i&gt;KP&lt;/i&gt; LUAD cell line allografts. For subcutaneous transplantation, cells were resuspended in S-MEM (Gibco, 11380-037) and mixed with Matrigel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CB-40230C) at a 1:1 ratio. Then, 250,000 cells were implanted subcutaneously into both flanks of NSG mice. For orthotopic transplantation, sorted cells were resuspended in PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and intratracheally administrated to NSG mice. For intravenous transplantation, 200,000 cells were resuspended in S-MEM and injected into NSG mice through the tail vein. All cell lines were continuously monitored for mycoplasma contamination. Approximately equal numbers of male and female mice were included in all experimental groups in all mouse experiments. Mice were treated in accordance with all relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations, and mice were euthanized by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asphyxiation, followed by intracardiac perfusion with S-MEM to clear tissues of blood when appropriate. A complete list of mice along with age, sex and age of tumour used in experiments is available (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). All animal studies were approved by the MSKCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 17-11-008). Sample sizes were determined based on our previous experience with similar models rather than statistical methods. We found this sufficient to detect biologically meaningful differences while minimizing animal use; experiments were randomized when feasible. Blinding was not possible as treatment effects on tumour volume were readily distinguishable between groups.

A list of the sequences of crRNAs is provided in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;KPfrt&lt;/i&gt; mES cells were thawed 2 days before targeting and the media were changed 1 day and 2 h before electroporation. Before electroporation, sequence-specific crRNA and universal tracrRNA were resuspended in IDTE buffer (IDT) at a concentration of 200 µM and the crRNA–tracrRNA duplex was then formed (final concentration, 44 µM) by combining an equimolar concentration of crRNA and tracrRNA and annealing at 95 °C for 5 min (followed by cooling down to room temperature at ramp rate of 0.1 °C s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). RNP complexes were formed by combining 22 pmol of crRNA–tracrRNA duplex and 22 pmol HiFi Cas9 nuclease and incubating at room temperature for 20 min. For each electroporation, 500,000 mES cells depleted of MEFs, 1 µl donor vector (3 µg µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 1 µl RNP complex, 2 µl electroporation enhancer (10 µM, IDT), 16.4 µl Nucleofector P3 primary cell solution and 3.6 µl Nucleofector Supplement 1 were combined and loaded into electroporation cuvette. The ES cells were then plated onto the top of feeder MEFs and, 48 h later, the ES cells were selected with either hygromycin (Slc4a11-FSF-MCD and Hopx-FSF-MACD, 150 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or G418 (Hipp11-FSF-GGCB, 400 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1 week.

The &lt;i&gt;KP&lt;/i&gt; LUAD cells were then co-transfected with the Slc4a11-FSF-MACD donor vector together with the U6-sgSlc4a11-EFS-Cas9 vector expressing guide RNA (ACATATGGGGAGGTATGAGC) targeting the last exon of &lt;i&gt;Slc4a11&lt;/i&gt; at a 1:1 ratio using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015). The transfected cells were selected with hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, 400053) at a concentration of 150 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 2 weeks and single-cell-derived drug-resistant clones were manually picked for expansion and genotyping with the following primers (5′ KI_F1 and 5′ KI_R1; 3′ KI_F1 and 3′ KI_R1). The single-cell-derived clones were transduced with AdCMVFlpO (Iowa Viral Vector Core) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500 to remove the frt-bGlobinpA-(PGK-Hygromycin-pA)i-frt STOP cassette. Excision of the STOP cassette was confirmed by genotyping spanning the left homology arm and mScarlet (recombined; 5′ KI_F1 and 5′ KI_R2) and by flow cytometry analysis detecting mScarlet fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#Fig14"&gt;9c,d&lt;/a&gt;).

Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (14143_B,16562_B) or X (15123_B, 15342_B, 15488_B, 15600_B, 15601_B, 15771_B, 16235_B, 16318_B, 16562_B, 16686_B, 17402_B, 17543_B) system in a PE28/88 run using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 (200 Cycles) or X 10B (100 cycles) or 25B (300 cycles) Reagent Kit (Illumina).

We then used this model to classify the cells generated in our 10x dataset. To assign cell state identities to each Leiden cluster generated from our SCANPY pipeline above, we took a pluralistic voting approach in which the cell states that were the most represented in a Leiden cluster were used as that cluster’s cell state identity. A rare exception to this were those Leiden clusters where a significant proportion of cells were identified as highly proliferative and were subsequently shown to have high &lt;i&gt;Mki67&lt;/i&gt; expression. These Leiden clusters were assigned a highly proliferative cell state identity. Cell state assignments can be found in the source code available at the GitHub repository above.

Once he got into his 30s, he would have &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/colon-cancer-warning-signs-never-ignore-t108646" target="_blank"&gt;precancerous growths&lt;/a&gt; — called polyps or adenomas — removed after every screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6c37f" class="body-graf"&gt;While that certainly takes a physical toll, "there is (also) a certain level of mental stress that it takes," Heyink, 48, tells TODAY.com. "Especially as I get older, and now that my brothers have had cancer, and a young one has passed away from it, it's quite anxiety-provoking," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f971a0" class="body-graf"&gt;Explaining the risks of Lynch syndrome to his four kids, Heyink tells them it's something they can "bring to God in prayer." And while that does bring some comfort, he knows firsthand what it feels like to have to remain constantly vigilant for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-234e1a" class="body-graf"&gt;After losing his older brother to adrenal gland cancer in 2022 and seeing his two other brothers go through cancer (stomach cancer and colon cancer), Heyink began looking deeper into ongoing Lynch syndrome research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f868cf" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, Heyink, a police officer in Hamilton, Ontario, was the only man in his immediate family to have escaped a cancer diagnosis. He stumbled upon a preventive cancer vaccine trial for people with Lynch syndrome, and reached out to the research team to find out if he could participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25a615" class="body-graf"&gt;In January 2023, he made the first of many trips down to Houston to participate in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-340e67"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="3088" data-original-width="2316"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg" alt="Kevin Heyink has Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colorectal cancer in men by up to 80%, according to MD Anderson."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kevin Heyink has Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colorectal cancer in men by up to 80%, according to MD Anderson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Heyink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7f365d" class="body-heading"&gt;Training the Body to Eliminate Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1d9e5" class="body-graf"&gt;There are around 1 million carriers of Lynch syndrome worldwide, Dr. Eduardo Vilar Sanchez, one of the trial leads and professor in the department of clinical cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4aac8" class="body-graf"&gt;And while colon cancer is the main cancer that people with Lynch syndrome are predisposed to, he says, researchers now see the condition as a "pan-cancer syndrome": It also raises the risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric and bowel cancers, as well as some brain tumors, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55d28e" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers think that Lynch syndrome may be one factor in the recent increases in cancer rates among younger patients, TODAY.com explained previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5eb987" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, with some clever biology and technology, drugmaker &lt;a href="https://nouscom.com/2026/01/16/nouscom-highlights-potential-of-nous-209-to-intercept-cancer-in-lynch-syndrome-carriers-in-seminal-nature-medicine-publication/" target="_blank"&gt;Nouscom&lt;/a&gt; developed a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05078866" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that can be trained to recognize certain proteins that Lynch syndrome carriers make. Using that immune response, the vaccine may be able to prevent them from developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-002745" class="body-graf"&gt;So, how does this actually work? The cells in your body are dividing all the time. Sometimes, errors happen in our DNA when those cells divide, but normally the body has a "mismatch repair" system to correct those mistakes, Vilar Sanchez explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4557e2" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the gene that is mutated in people with Lynch syndrome is the one that's responsible for the machinery needed to correct those errors. That results in the formation of unique proteins in the bodies of people with Lynch syndrome, which may lead to the development of cancerous or precancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37dd11" class="body-graf"&gt;Using a modified and inactive version of an adenovirus (not &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-rcna79987" target="_blank"&gt;mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt;), the vaccine trains the body to develop an immune response to those unusual proteins, Vilar Sanchez explains. Unlike some other cancer vaccines that show promise in treating the disease, this one is designed to be &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer-vaccine-cleveland-clinic-launches-trial-t235952" target="_blank"&gt;purely preventive&lt;/a&gt;, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ed1a6" class="body-graf"&gt;So, if someone with Lynch syndrome who has received the vaccine does develop cancer cells or pre-cancerous lesions down the line, "the immune system is already trained to recognize these proteins and eliminate the cancer cells," Vilar Sanchez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98c61b" class="body-graf"&gt;Heyink is one of 45 Lynch syndrome carriers who participated in a recent trial of the vaccine. Crucially, they were all healthy at the time they enrolled in the trial, and none of them had signs of cancer, which was confirmed by colonoscopies before and after the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eef1f" class="body-graf"&gt;The results of that phase 1b/2 trial, designed primarily to assess vaccine safety, were just published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04182-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Those results showed that all participants were able to safely receive the vaccine and researchers detected a sufficient immune response, which persisted for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc2deb" class="body-graf"&gt;Participants developed fewer precancerous lesions after the vaccine and no one developed advanced cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b000d" class="body-heading"&gt;For Heyink, the Results Have Been 'Incredible'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90e9db" class="body-graf"&gt;In August of 2023, he had his usual screening and, “for the first time in 20 years, it came back perfectly clear,” he says. “There were no polyps or anything.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b43af5" class="body-graf"&gt;Since then, he's had two other colonoscopies that also came back clear. "That's three in a row that have come back without any pre-cancerous growths, which is just just incredible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c09e2" class="body-graf"&gt;There were some temporary side effects of the vaccine, which were similar to those of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/are-mrna-vaccines-safe-rcna223592" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, Vilar Sanchez says. They included redness and soreness at the injection site, as well as a mild fever and general fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-192dbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Following his first vaccine dose, Heyink says he felt exhausted after a long day of travel. He developed a low-grade fever and felt achey the next day. But that was it, and after his next two doses in January and May of 2024, he had no noticeable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-482911"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="865" data-original-width="649"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg" alt="Heyink hopes that his participation in the clinical trial will help create a healthier future for the next generation, including his kids, nieces and nephews."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Heyink hopes that his participation in the clinical trial will help create a healthier future for the next generation, including his kids, nieces and nephews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Heyink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-92e0b3" class="body-heading"&gt;A Rare Sense of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a07f6" class="body-graf"&gt;It will take more trials to truly understand how effective this vaccine is and to get it approved for wider use, Vilar Sanchez says. But these results are "a message of hope that things are moving forward," he says, adding that the "the energy of the participants in this clinical trial was so refreshing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-092adc" class="body-graf"&gt;This trial was able to meet its recruiting requirements the fastest of any trial Vilar Sanchez has worked on, he says, and he was fielding emails from potential participants across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b1483b" class="body-graf"&gt;"I attribute all of this to the work of God," Heyink says. "He's led me on this path, he's given me this opportunity." A Lynch syndrome diagnosis may cause anxiety, he adds, but this trial is an example of "hope on the horizon." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3079b6" class="body-graf"&gt;In particular, Heyink sees his participation in the trial as his way of paying it forward to the future, the same way his father helped by identifying Lynch syndrome in their family. And he hopes the vaccine will one day be available for his children, as well as his nieces and nephews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae664" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;"It's really important for the next generation," he says, and it's reassuring to know "this may be an option for them, and they won't have to worry about developing cancer halfway through their lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:11:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNdG1HTDEtS3NmSGcyZ1ctUGd6SUFKWk8xZ09EakRFcGhwa0tvTE4wTzZvS19ubUUtTDFibTdDMG0zNHpJMjhtbGtkUEJYNWZjSk5lSUgyMnRxWmRHQnI0VUhRUXlvUHBfemFxcjVIRndURWlOSzZ5UllydkpZazFUeHkwOA</guid></item><item><title>弗吉尼亚州第三名麻疹患儿访问了福尔斯彻奇伍德布里奇的医疗机构- wtop.com</title><link>https://wtop.com/virginia/2026/01/3rd-child-with-measles-in-virginia-visited-health-care-facilities-in-woodbridge-falls-church/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Virginia health officials are warning that people who were around the most recently-diagnosed patient may have been exposed to the highly-contagious illness.

                &lt;p&gt;A young child who lives in Northern Virginia has tested positive for measles after traveling internationally, marking the third case in the state this month, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three cases of measles have involved children who are ages 4 or younger; the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/2026-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-investigating-another-confirmed-measles-case-in-northern-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; officials clarified Tuesday that the latest case is unrelated to the one reported on Jan. 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginia health officials are warning that people who were around the most recently-diagnosed patient may have been exposed to the highly-contagious illness. The child visited several health care centers in Northern Virginia last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the sites where Virginia health officials said people could have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, two children in Northern Virginia have contracted measles as well as another child who lives in the central part of the Commonwealth, &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases come amid multiple measles outbreaks in the U.S. that have put the country at risk of losing its measles-free designation, international health authorities told &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2026/01/the-us-is-on-the-verge-of-losing-its-measles-elimination-status-heres-why-that-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, states with three or more related cases would constitute an outbreak. There have been no new outbreaks reported by the CDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What to do if you’ve potentially been exposed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned you may have been exposed to measles, Virginia health officials said to look into whether you’ve been vaccinated or had the illness in the past. That includes being up to date on vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginians can&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/request-immunization-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; request their immunization status online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not fully vaccinated and have not had measles in the past, health officials recommend you contact your health care provider or call your local health department. There are post-exposure treatments that can be used in certain scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for measles symptoms for 21 days, according to Virginia health officials. In the most recent case, the most likely time frame for others to get sick would be between Jan. 20 to Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should symptoms pop up, health officials said to isolate at home and call your health care provider. Those symptoms could include a runny nose, fever over 101 degrees, cough, red or watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

He also called 111 [the U.K.'s non-emergency medical number].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Abrahams was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics, his condition deteriorated and leg pain left him unable to move, according to the BBC. Three days before his death, Abrahams had a video consultation with an out-of-hours doctor on Jan. 20, 2023, with the medic diagnosing sciatica. Per &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve from the buttocks and down each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Louise Harris / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Abrahams had a high temperature and high blood sugar levels, an ambulance crew said he didn't need to go to the hospital when his family called them 12 hours after his sciatica diagnosis. He was admitted to the hospital two days later, but died the following day, the BBC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his death, attempts had been made to save Abrahams by amputating his leg, ITV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams with his parents and younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before the court investigation into his death, Abrahams' father, Richard, said, "It’s so frustrating — they know they could have treated him better than they did," per ITV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want justice and accountability. Someone has to be held responsible," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abrahams' mother, Julie, said, "We would just like to know where they went wrong, how they let Luke down, and for them to be honest and to show accountability, so we can properly grieve and let Luke rest in peace properly," ITV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Jevons, head of patient safety and coroner services for East Midlands Ambulance Service, admitted during the court investigation that Abrahams should've been taken to the hospital, per the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jevons said, "If you look at Luke's presentation, it was not normal. Blood sugar and pain score warranted a transfer to [the] hospital," she said, adding, "He was an unwell man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He'd been treated and it wasn't working. Leaving him at home wasn't going to get the treatment he required," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was confirmed during the court investigation that a paramedic involved had since left the ambulance service after being supervised for some time after the incident, the BBC stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams and his younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November 2024 article, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yr17g5d44o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; noted that an investigation into Abrahams' death had been opened, but the coroner had adjourned the court hearing until May 2025 after stating he had died of "natural causes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous report stated that a serious incident investigation at the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust had found that the crew failed to follow guidelines and policies before Abrahams' death, the BBC reported, adding that his symptoms should have indicated a life-threatening condition and resulted in a transfer to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation also said that the fact that Abrahams wasn't taken to the hospital meant there was a "missed opportunity" for him to get medical help, which could have prevented "deterioration," per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams with his parents and younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He just got on with everyone, he had a second for everyone," Abrahams' parents told the BBC of their son before Tuesday's court investigation. "He used to go out at 11 at night because his friend needed a chat. He would make time for everyone, just bringing everyone together. That was Luke," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment and additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson told PEOPLE in an email, "With the [investigation] underway, and we believe currently planned to continue until Thursday, we will be waiting until the Coroner has concluded before sharing a statement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Northampton Coroner's Office confirmed to PEOPLE that the [investigation] may conclude on Thursday, Jan. 22, or Friday, Jan. 23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/doctors-dismissed-symptoms-tonsillitis-sciatica-days-later-he-died-from-sepsis-and-flesh-eating-disease-11889378" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9yb1FQTFZvNGdKUFk5d3B6Wm00NE5ZeE9jNkdPYnViU2pBNXFwNHdwRjlGcjkwRjE2cmlGa0pDUEFzeGQtQXd5UVVmWmNzMmo3SWRwdzgxLVdDOWVYT0NHTkdPcnFQM3NRYUFNZkd0QkY0X1E</guid></item><item><title>真菌感染在两个田纳西州县蔓延；卫生官员说- wreg.com</title><link>https://wreg.com/news/health/fungal-infection-spreads-in-two-tn-counties-health-officials-say/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Now, a large-scale study suggests that strength-training adds years to life. Here, discover what the study found, plus how strength-training may extend your life and some expert-backed tips on incorporating it into your fitness routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-milica-mcdowell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milica McDowell, D.P.T.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milica McDowell, D.P.T.&lt;/a&gt;, the assistant vice president of education at U.S. Physical Therapy; Tami Smith, C.P.T., certified personal trainer and founder of &lt;a href="https://fithealthymacros.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit Healthy Macros;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fit Healthy Macros&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/13/11/883" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took a closer look at the impact of weight training on aging in nearly 5,000 people between 20 and 69 years old. Researchers measured the length of each of the participant's telomeres (protective DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes). &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3370421/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Telomeres;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Telomeres&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shorten at a consistent rate as you get older, so they wanted to see if people who strength-trained regularly had longer telomeres than those who did not. To do so, participants were asked how often they worked out, including how often they did strength-training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that participants who reported the most time spent strength training had significantly longer telomeres than those in the no strength-training category. More specifically, they found that strength-training for 90 minutes a week was linked with almost four years less biological aging. That is, potentially extending their lives by nearly four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is defined as any movement against a resistance that helps your muscles get stronger, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-milica-mcdowell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milica McDowell, D.P.T.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milica McDowell, D.P.T.&lt;/a&gt;, the assistant vice president of education at U.S. Physical Therapy. “Unlike endurance or mobility training, which help your muscles contract more frequently over a period of time, or have greater flexibility, strength training is a very specific type of training that is focused on how much force you can generate,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can building your muscles lead to a longer life? Strength training helps reduce cardiovascular disease and death risks as it reduces your blood pressure, resting heart rate (over time), and stress levels, said McDowell. “It can help with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a43122348/weight-training-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;weight loss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and body composition management, also factors that contribute to reducing disease and death risk,” she said. Strength training also improves your stamina and balance to reduce your risk of falls and counteract the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of exercise may also help extend your life by &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a44284752/physical-activity-bone-density-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protecting your bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protecting your bones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, joints, and ligaments from injuries that can often be life-threatening as we age, said Tami Smith, C.P.T., certified personal trainer and founder of &lt;a href="https://fithealthymacros.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit Healthy Macros;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fit Healthy Macros&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It also can help combat chronic disease and improve your mental wellbeing,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits, according to the study, include reducing muscle loss, increasing resting metabolic rate, reducing body fat, and decreasing oxidative stress, all of which may “limit disease and slow the aging of cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add more strength training to your routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study align with the current exercise guidelines in the U.S. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/index.html#:~:text=Each%20week%20adults%20need%20150,day%2C%205%20days%20a%20week." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends two strength workouts per week for adults, said McDowell. “This could be as simple as a bodyweight routine to get your heart rate up a little and those muscles working,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you purchase a set of dumbbells, beginners should focus on short duration (under 20 minutes) and total body workouts, with general exercises, McDowell said. Bodyweight exercises like squats, planks, and triceps dips are ideal &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g69656476/strength-training-exercises-women-over-50/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strength training exercises for people over 50;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strength training exercises for people over 50&lt;/a&gt; to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal should be to focus on your form and aim to perfect it before picking up weights and adding resistance to your routine, Smith agreed. “With time and consistency, you will get stronger and be able to incorporate heavier weights and additional exercises,” she said. Smith recommended starting with two to three strength-training sessions per week, spending 15-20 minutes on each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a strength class or scheduling a session with a personal trainer is also a great way to get comfortable with weights and learn proper form, said McDowell. “If you are a beginner, many gyms will have a beginning or foundations strength class where you can learn principles under the watchful eye of a coach who can ensure you do the movements correctly,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research shows that everyone should be adding some form of strength training to their fitness routine to promote longevity and overall health. “Strength training not only adds years to your life, but it also improves the quality of those years,” Smith said. Plus, adding strength training to your routine could mean the difference between being able to walk around freely and independently as we age versus relying on the assistance of others for our activities of daily living, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:20:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOT0MyU0p2S0RXb0J1bDV5WHhuZTdZczRLLU5sNzFqa1Q1WVFKdWtSSDQteFhDMnRYRkVveUpJa2dTOHplSHUzVFlSZVlOUXJ6b0JLMUpZTm9TVWNsU29KUkV2ajVvQXRqT0o4aFBLcUV1aTRiRzg4Q181TXduTVZELTlCLXg</guid></item><item><title>“死亡预支现金” ：陌生、病态的艾滋病暴利世界-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/21/cashing-out-documentary-short-aids-profiteering</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uring the summer of 2020, at the onset of the Covid pandemic, the documentary director Matt Nadel was back home in Boca Raton, Florida. He remembers one particular evening walk that he took with his father, Phil, as they weathered out those early months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As they strode through the neighborhood, Nadel, now 26, said that the prospect of a vaccine was exciting, but the idea of pharmaceutical executives profiting off a devastating virus left him feeling uneasy. Phil grew concerned by the complex ethical predicament that his son laid out, and Nadel could quickly tell that his father was acting strangely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think I have to tell you something,” Phil said mid-walk, before explaining that in the early days of the HIV/Aids epidemic he had invested in what are known as, “viatical settlements”. Phil would buy the life insurance policies of people dying of Aids, often with just weeks or months to live, for a portion of the plan’s value in cash. For many, it afforded them the ability to pay for food, rent and hospital bills as debilitating illness left them unable to work. For others, it was their chance to blow the funds on travel or experiences with the limited time they had left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026","elementId":"1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/documentaries-coming-out-this-year"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was thrown for a total loop,” Nadel told the Guardian. “He had been part of this industry, and that the profits he made from it had helped to bankroll my childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Nadel, a gay film-maker, it sent him into a “spiral” that did not begin with the desire to make a movie. “I understand myself as somebody who stands on the shoulders of Aids activists who use their bodies to create a world in which I can be healthy and take my PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] every morning, and also in which I can be relatively free as a gay man,” he said. “So many of the advances in gay rights came from the visibility of the Aids era, and here I was learning that my existence and privilege was hinged in some way on those same people dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fad95cd5-eb3a-4f8b-b200-85ed6c922f76" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As he began investigating the muddied history of viatical settlements throughout the peak of the Aids crisis, the outlines of a film started to emerge. The result is Nadel’s Oscar-shortlisted documentary short, Cashing Out, which tells the story of how a cottage industry of buying up life insurance policies was both ghoulish and liberating in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the film’s main characters, Scott Page, inadvertently configured an early viatical settlement when his partner, Greg, who was living with Aids, became progressively sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Short on cash, but armed with a robust life insurance policy, Page ran an advertisement in a local paper to see if someone could buy Greg’s plan in exchange for an advance. When a private investor reached out, the couple struck up a “loose agreement” that allowed Greg to live out the time he had left with some financial security. The payout meant they could also move into a house and get a golden retriever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As dozens of old pictures flash across the screen, you see an idyllic slideshow of two people with a rich life: fixing up their home, lying by the beach and laughing with friends. But it’s also a bittersweet record of Greg’s final months. Page ultimately remembers how the money in-hand was “absolutely transformative” for his late boyfriend, as he “saw the stress leave his body”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The absurdity of getting a cash advance on your death, however, wasn’t lost on Page. When he saw the peace and freedom it gave Greg before he died, he turned his energy into becoming a viatical broker for scores of other gay men – often without loved ones by their bedside – who were dying of an illness that much of the federal government had shrouded in shame and prejudice. When Page started to approach banks and credit unions about getting involved in the investment scheme, they were incredulous and insisted that payouts should be for the families of the deceased. For Page, their arguments weren’t rooted in reality. “These people’s families have walked away from them,” he recalls in the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It meant that private individuals made up most of the initial investor network when it came to buying up policies. They were provided a morbid ledger. On one side, the value of a policy and the dollar amount needed to buy it outright, on the other, the T-cell count of a person living with HIV/Aids and their life expectancy. Often, it served as an assurance that a payout was inevitable. The sicker the policyholder, the quicker the windfall for the investor. Soon, institutions realized that these small-time individual investors were making a lot of money, and changed their tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel constructs his documentary like a deeply reported magazine story: gripping anecdotes, a rich – albeit macabre – historical backdrop, and varied voices who show that while some people benefited from viatical settlements, there were so many who were left out of the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;DeeDee Chamblee, a trailblazing advocate and activist reminds us that for Black trans women living with Aids – who often didn’t have jobs that provided life insurance policies – a viatical settlement was something they could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e291937c-773f-4d00-9857-5c84610327ca" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A still from Cashing Out.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: New Yorker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the most harrowing moments of the documentary comes when Chamblee remembers suffering through her illness, with only three T-cells left, and how she would fantasize about getting a payout to live out her final days in peace. “I could go to the beach, and I could stay there until this thing is through,” she reminisces. “That was not a reality at all,” she adds, expecting to end up buried in a wooden box in a “potter’s field” with other unclaimed bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chamblee’s testimony is a jolting reminder that her experience living with Aids is a world away from the white, gay men who had policies to sell. In making Cashing Out, Nadel realized the most marginalized, particularly trans sex workers of color, aren’t “afforded a shred of basic dignity when their death is imminent”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But by the late 1990s, significant developments in antiretroviral therapy meant that HIV-positive people started living longer, defying the odds and outliving the predictions that viatical investors were initially promised. “It was going great, until people didn’t die all the time,” Page says, with a glint of karmic joy in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, those betting on death stopped cashing in so easily. Instead, they found themselves stuck paying premiums on policies that would never pay out. “I think they banked on that not being an urgent enough question for our world to answer,” Nadel said. “Then they were angered when the activists from Act Up successfully pushed the government to develop and release drugs quickly … anybody who invested their whole retirement in viaticals was making a really bad investment decision, and that is no one’s fault but their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel filmed interviews with his subjects – Page, Chamblee and Sean Strub, a long‑term survivor who founded POZ magazine – over the course of a year. Their unfiltered honesty ultimately prompted him to fold in the story of his own father’s investment in viatical settlements. “I just felt like they were submitting themselves so fully to the process,” he said. “And so for me to have a secret about my relationship with this, that I was keeping from the audience, just felt wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent interview, Nadel said that while his thesis for the film had shifted over time, it now seemed straightforward. “This helped a lot of people, but I’m disgusted that it had to exist,” he said. Modern‑day precarity in accessing healthcare in the US – from the expiration of Covid‑era Obamacare subsidies to the substantial cuts to Medicaid funding projected over the next decade – means Cashing Out can serve as both a historically specific and evergreen indictment of the country’s tenuous social safety net, Nadel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the government refuses to fulfil its role in taking care of us, we have to come together and find creative ways to take care of each other,” he said. “Illness does not discriminate … so I want to encourage people who watch the film to find their strange bedfellows in the fight for survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQWlk2V1MwMXZaUGxrdmZoMGNJanJ3eXNydkx0TV9xMVotekFwRl9Pbk5URjVPeW91b2lGcmdGanFVTUo2dF9sVXdhdnZQRHRUR1BKTEVUSkVHVHhhNHhhNWhUcmlfeTBUa0M2Qm82QVEtUGRBUnpoNWlmclBjNzBPdVh6VG10TVdOUVRTMXRUMDBod3Jwcndz</guid></item><item><title>如何增强您的免疫系统-您当地的流行病学家</title><link>https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/how-to-strengthen-your-immune-system</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Your Local Epidemiologist</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:36:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQdW5Xc3VZQ3ZMZVBKZVVWOHdRbG9meWYxbEtxTmxJTUdHRlM5YnZfTzViMjFPX2xqdjVraEI3UTF1QnQwMWRDWDBzaXA1VEhwRjZGN1ZQbXhjR0FmSEFLanF5RW9qeHo0NEhmODRKUzhlOFo3Z3ZpcUx0dDBfOW11VE1xbVFiS3BpZXhv</guid></item><item><title>“不要忽视你身体的信号” ：如何真正照顾你的脖子-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/21/how-to-look-after-your-neck-posture-stretch</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re reading this on your device, chin tucked into your chest, or leaning over your desk shaped like a question mark, pause for a moment. How’s your neck feeling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The way we sit, scroll and work means we often hold static positions for too long, creating tension and stiffness that radiates through the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say we can change how we move to counteract the strain and protect your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="take-micro-breaks-to-reset" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Take ‘micro breaks’ to reset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work at a desk, aim to break up sitting every 30 to 45 minutes, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at Western Sydney University. Simply standing up for 60 to 90 seconds is enough to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Regular ‘active breaks’ can reduce neck and back discomfort and reduce office stress,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While you are standing, he suggests taking a few deep breaths while rolling your shoulders back.

Try adding a quick 30-60 second walk during these breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="vary-your-tasks" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Vary your tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do not ignore your body’s signals, if you feel tension or discomfort, take it as a cue to move,” says Dr Poonam Mehta, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at the University of Technology in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you can’t move away from what you’re doing, try varying your tasks every hour, says Dr Peter Stubbs, physiotherapist and lecturer at University of Technology Sydney. So, if you have been typing for an hour, switch to a task that doesn’t require a screen – like a phone call or make a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bring-the-device-to-you" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Bring the device to you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Tame tech neck” by bringing your screen closer to eye level, Cavaleri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He says small habits, like using a laptop riser or propping your phone on a stand, can significantly reduce the load on your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven agrees, suggesting you check that elbows and knees are at 90 degrees, screen at eye height, with keyboard and mouse close. If you use dual screens, ensure they are at the correct height and position with the main screen directly in front to avoid being in a twisted position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You can also occasionally move your monitor slightly to the left or right, which forces your neck to rotate gently and prevents getting “stuck” in a fixed gaze, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6d17c518-7bb1-42b9-9eb8-0023f83d7b05" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Tame tech neck’ by bringing your screen closer to eye level, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, a senior lecturer in physiotherapy.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="gentle-stretches" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Gentle stretches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Don’t crack your neck, do strong stretches or repetitive self manipulating,” Treleaven says. While this may feel good temporarily, it is risky and doesn’t help, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the experts recommend gentle mobility exercises a few times a day, even while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven suggests a move called the “bow and arrow”. To do it, sit with arms extended in front of you, palms touching. Slide one hand back along your other arm, pulling your elbow back as if drawing a bowstring. Let your head follow the moving elbow, rotating gently to look behind you. Slowly reverse the motion to the start and repeat on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs recommends exercises with a small range of motion and no jerky movements such as slow, controlled neck nods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other effective micro-stretches he suggests are side rotations (keep your shoulders still and slowly turn your head to look over your left shoulder, then slowly to your right) and the ear-to-shoulder, in which you drop your ear down towards your shoulder without lifting your shoulder up to meet your ear. Aim for up to 30 repetitions, if comfortable, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="move-it" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Move it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cavaleri says regular exercise improves neck and overall musculoskeletal health. He suggests choosing walking meetings, taking the stairs, a brisk walk at lunch, or cycling to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Accumulating 30-60 minutes of moderate activity most days is a good goal, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs adds that even if you have mild pain, keep up gentle movements so your neck does not freeze up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="check-your-stress-and-sleep" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Check your stress and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People carry stress in their neck,” Treleaven says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘We stick them in shoes and forget about them’: how to really look after your feet","elementId":"4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/18/we-stick-them-in-shoes-and-forget-about-them-how-to-really-look-after-your-feet"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs says a significant part of neck pain comes from unconscious muscle tensing, particularly in the trapezius – a pair of large triangular muscles extending over the back of the neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He suggests taking a moment of mindfulness during your breaks.

Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aeb4249" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;published last week in Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;, could lead to more precise treatments and earlier diagnosis of an autoimmune condition known as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4H3Q33RSI5EKFG5UXEYACFJGVE"&gt;The disease affects roughly one in a million people each year and often strikes young adults.

It may be days or weeks before the full picture becomes clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7IJJ53YA3ZBFDJ333UMYX6MRPA"&gt;But Westbrook said diagnosing the disorder early is notoriously difficult because its symptoms can mimic psychiatric illness, viral infections or other neurological disorders. He said many patients are first referred to a psychiatrist before the immune cause is identified — a pattern described in the book and film &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZn6G0M9wNs" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZn6G0M9wNs"&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/a&gt;, which brought public attention to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5HUGCHWBWJAKXMNYNUUXZLP7W4"&gt;“That delay can be dangerous,” Westbrook said. “By the time the disease is diagnosed, patients may already be very sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VOVTEA3SGJD5BPYGR763C53EUY"&gt;If diagnosis is delayed, symptoms can worsen, leading to seizures or extreme states such as catatonia, in which patients may be unable to move or speak, according to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ZP6S73LKFHU7DRPTUCZYBFBNI"&gt;Westbrook said the mouse model used in the study helps overcome that limitation, by allowing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ACDNBRPJBFB2BEWWVP4NZG5KDE"&gt;researchers to study the disease from its earliest moments — something that isn’t possible in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ECJK5QDJ2NBJZMRBCJ435T5XJM"&gt;Gouaux said the findings are especially important for drug development. He said current treatments rely on broadly suppressing the immune system. While many patients improve, recovery can be slow and relapses are common, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JD7SKESHQRFOXDE63GPAGYCCOM"&gt;“Now that we know exactly how and where the antibodies bind, the most straightforward approach would be to simply block that interaction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JEUVSRDPMRAVJJWLQKLOFO5O7M"&gt;The research could also improve diagnosis by making antibody tests more specific. Gouaux said current blood tests can detect NMDA receptor antibodies but can’t show where they bind or reliably predict who will develop the disease — something the new findings could help address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WP7Q3DOO6ZARPO22NKVV7BFUG4"&gt;“This work simplifies strategies to test for the disease more precisely,” Gouaux said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QAM3WMK3KFBGLGZQEU35Q56XTA"&gt;As testing improves and awareness grows, Westbrook said more cases could be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FLNSDGMO5RBXBEHUZMPLRG3D2I"&gt;“We were seeing this disorder long before we knew what it was,” he said. “As awareness improves, more cases are almost certainly going to be identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>oregonlive.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么用屏幕“放松”可能会让我们感到压力更大–以下是应该尝试的方法-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/why-unwinding-with-screens-may-be-making-us-more-stressed-heres-what-to-try-instead-272887</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body " itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Americans increasingly report &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/10/multiple-stressors-no-function#"&gt;feeling overwhelmed by daily life&lt;/a&gt;, many are using &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;self-care&lt;/a&gt; to cope. Conversations and social media feeds are saturated with the language of “me time,” burnout, boundaries and nervous system regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this demand, the wellness industry has grown into a &lt;a href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/industry-research/2025-global-wellness-economy-monitor/"&gt;multitrillion-dollar global market&lt;/a&gt;. Myriad providers offer products, services and lifestyle prescriptions that promise calm, balance and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, though, even as interest in self-care continues to grow, Americans’ mental health &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/700079/mental-health-ratings-continue-worsen.aspx"&gt;is getting worse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a professor of &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PD3BtwIAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; who studies health behaviors and the gap between intentions and outcomes. I became interested in this self-care paradox recently, after I suffered from a concussion. I was prescribed two months of strictly screen-free cognitive rest – no television, email, Zooming, social media, streaming or texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits were almost immediate, and they surprised me. I slept better, had a longer attention span and had a newfound sense of mental quiet. These effects reflected a well-established principle in neuroscience: When cognitive and emotional stimuli decrease, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biology14040395"&gt;brain’s regulatory systems can recover&lt;/a&gt; from overload and chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, most people can’t go 100% screen-free for days, much less months, but the underlying principle offers a powerful lesson for practicing effective self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A nation under strain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans’ self-rated mental health is now at the &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/700079/mental-health-ratings-continue-worsen.aspx"&gt;lowest point since Gallup started tracking this issue in 2001&lt;/a&gt;. National surveys consistently detect &lt;a href="https://www.stress.org/news/what-the-latest-reports-say-about-stress-in-america/"&gt;high levels of stress and emotional strain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly one-third of U.S. adults report &lt;a href="https://casatondemand.org/2024/02/15/insights-from-the-latest-stress-in-america-report/"&gt;feeling overwhelmed most days&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep disruption, anxiety, poor concentration and emotional exhaustion are widespread, particularly among &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/658082/pandemic-effects-linger-americans-health-ratings.aspx"&gt;young adults and women&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic disease patterns mirror this strain. When daily stress becomes chronic, it can trigger biological changes that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response"&gt;increase the risk of long-term conditions&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease and diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 6 in 10 U.S. adults live with at least one chronic condition, and 4 in 10 live with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;multiple chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMOc-4zNj30?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Stress triggers physiological responses that can lead to a range of symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How people try to cope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Americans say they actively practice self-care in everyday life. For example, they describe taking mental health days, protecting personal time, setting boundaries around work and &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;prioritizing rest and leisure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in how they use that leisure time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 22 years, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey has consistently found that &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm"&gt;watching television is the most popular leisure activity&lt;/a&gt; for U.S. adults. Americans spend far more time watching TV than exercising, spending time with friends or practicing reflection through activities like yoga. Other common self-care activities include &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;watching movies and gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern leisure time increasingly includes smartphone use. Surveys suggest that mobile phones have become the dominant screen for many Americans, with adults spending &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html#"&gt;several hours per day on their phones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many adults, checking social media or watching short videos has become a default relaxation behavior layered on top of traditional screen use. This practice is often referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.digitalturbine.com/blog/second-screening-understanding-usage-and-audiences"&gt;second screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many people turn to screen-based activities to wind down, these activities may have the opposite effect biologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why modern screen use feels different&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-internet forms of leisure often involved activities such as watching scheduled television programs, listening to radio broadcasts or reading books and magazines. For all of these pastimes, the content followed a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_flow"&gt;predictable sequence with natural stopping points&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s digital media environment looks very different. People routinely engage with multiple screens at once, respond to frequent notifications and switch rapidly between several streams of content. These environments continuously require users to split their attention, engage their emotions and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of mental multitasking draws on the same neural systems people are often attempting to rest with leisure. The result is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/tmb0000106"&gt;far more fragmented and cognitively demanding environment&lt;/a&gt; than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans now spend approximately &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/screen-time-statistics/"&gt;six to seven hours per day&lt;/a&gt; on screens across multiple devices. Splitting attention between more than one screen at a time, such as using the phone while watching television, is common. This juggling exposes peoples’ brains to &lt;a href="https://research.mountain.com/insights/an-exploration-of-second-screen-use-by-tv-viewers/"&gt;multiple streams of sensory and emotional input simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey data also suggests that Americans &lt;a href="https://www.nbcpalmsprings.com/2024/12/18/americans-check-their-phones-205-times-a-day-in-2024-report-reveals"&gt;may check their phones roughly 200 times per day&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, they repeatedly pull their attention back to screens during routine moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern digital platforms are designed to maximize engagement. Algorithms tend to prioritize emotionally arousing content, particularly &lt;a href="https://freemannews.tulane.edu/2024/10/11/rage-clicks-study-shows-how-political-outrage-fuels-social-media-engagement"&gt;anger, anxiety and outrage&lt;/a&gt;. These feelings drive clicks, sharing and time spent on platforms. Research has shown that this design is associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2025.102647"&gt;higher stress, distraction and cognitive load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When ‘rest’ doesn’t restore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of daily hassles and competing demands, it can feel like relief to flip on the TV. Practices such as streaming or so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_rotting"&gt;bed-rotting&lt;/a&gt; – spending extended periods in bed while scrolling – often are framed as &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/bed-rotting-self-care"&gt;a form of radical rest or self-care&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other common coping behaviors include leaving the television on as background noise, scrolling between tasks throughout the day or using phones during meals and conversations. These strategies can feel restful because they temporarily reduce external demands and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, pairing rest with screen use may undermine the very restoration that people are seeking. Digital media &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105674"&gt;stimulate attention, emotion and sensory processing&lt;/a&gt;. Even while people are sitting or lying still, being onscreen can keep their nervous systems in a heightened state of arousal. It may look like downtime, but it doesn’t create the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mental-health/seven-rest-types"&gt;biological conditions for restoration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DM74t05v4s1","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to wind down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that mental relief comes not from adding new coping strategies, but from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biology14040395"&gt;reducing the number of demands placed on the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some evidence-based strategies that support genuine restoration: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to intentionally reduce mental load, not to abandon all digital devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve well-being in our overstimulated society, it’s important to understand the difference between feeling as though you are unwinding and actually allowing your brain and body to recover. In my view, fewer screens, fewer inputs, fewer emotional demands and more protected time for genuine cognitive rest are important components of an effective wellness strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Travelers are advised to wear repellent and cover up bare skin as needed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many travelers dream of vacationing in a &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/holiday-getaway-states-2025-analysis-11870406" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;warm, sunny place&lt;/a&gt;, ideally by the beach. Unfortunately, the climate of those locales means they are more often than not home to one pesky pest that can make a perfect day outdoors and into an itchy, scratchy mess. And there's one city that you should probably pack a can of insect repellent for, if you plan to visit.

The &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti &lt;/em&gt;mosquito is the most common species in L.A. and is known as the “ankle biter.” The species has also been linked to an increased number of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/cdc-updates-alert-for-19-countries-over-dengue-11735522" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dengue fever cases&lt;/a&gt; in the city as well.

But one of the nurses is at least compassionate or seems so. I’m relieved I haven’t met her before, given it’s my third visit here this week. She must be new. She doesn’t suggest I’m wasting everyone’s time as she readjusts the fetal heart monitor. I study her sparkly Crocs and the crucifix around her neck and ask if she has children. “Three,” she tells me. A few of the nurses don’t bother hiding their eye rolls anymore, so I make a point of seeking out the friendly ones who call me “sweetie” or “honey” because they feel sorry for this woman who they are certain has lost her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I alternate between the two main hospitals in my small southern city to give the medical staff at each one a break from me. Since I entered the second half of my pregnancy, I have been to each unit more than a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntz900443b7amaff61f5@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;I’m strapped to a monitor in a hospital cot, pretending I can decipher some meaning in the machine’s beeps and whirs. Some nights that I’ve felt propelled to the hospital, my husband has refused to come with me. On the edge of tears himself, he has said he feels he’s enabling an illness. My response has been both resentful (&lt;em&gt;How could he do this to me?&lt;/em&gt;) and relieved (&lt;em&gt;Of course he’s right&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntz900453b7amc1w0n1w@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;But tonight, my husband waits calmly for my release from across the room. He’s almost as exhausted as I am, having driven us down a deserted predawn highway. I watch the printed graph of my child’s heartbeat unspool into rolls of zigzags on the hospital floor. Hospital staff come and go. The ones I haven’t met before stare at me confused. “The baby looks good.” “The baby is probably fine.” “Statistics are in your favor.” “No amount of monitoring will ensure a healthy baby,” they all tell me. Their platitudes multiply like cells. Intellectually, I know they are right. But &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ambition-work-ocd.html"&gt;OCD&lt;/a&gt;, my lifelong roommate, insists I keep checking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00463b7av9aabj6g@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;They’re preparing my discharge paperwork now. I’m told that everything looks good. “Well, that’s a relief,” my husband says. He’s not being sarcastic; it just sounds that way. He’s thinking that the only silver lining here is that the nearby Whataburger is open 24/7. He knows I will sit in the drive-through analyzing my after-visit summary as we await our milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00473b7afoi5s8kz@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Leaving with a clean bill of health again will be humiliating, but it’s better than what awaits at home. I know with certainty that &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/pregnancy-put-my-ocd-into-overdrive.html"&gt;intrusive thoughts&lt;/a&gt; will return. &lt;em&gt;What if I fall asleep and fail to notice that the baby has stopped moving? Is four kicks an hour normal, or is it five? If I feel only four in two hours, is she slowly losing oxygen? Is that a somersault? Is the umbilical cord strangling her? Isn’t that move unnaturally forceful — desperate? See, she is in distress. I knew it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00483b7ayvsnw4vh@published" data-word-count="231"&gt;After my husband collapses back into bed and my dogs sniff me curiously, I go to the refrigerator and select the most sugary drink I can find — orange juice or chocolate milk — to induce fetal movement. I open the cupboard and scoop some peanut butter into my mouth. I slink into the spare room so that I can have some privacy: I prefer to do my rituals unobserved, in the pitch-dark. I lie on my back and clench my jaw, tears coming into my eyes as I try to will my daughter to start kicking. &lt;em&gt;There, that is one. &lt;/em&gt;I wait in suspense for the second. It seems like it’s taking longer between kicks than usual. But what does “usual” mean when a baby is constantly growing? I grab my phone and start researching fetal movement. I see the same websites and message boards I’ve read before, but I reread the posts that nauseate me the most, daring myself to face potential catastrophes. Now, I’m also afraid I’m leaking amniotic fluid, even though I already had the nurses test for that just a few hours ago. I go to the bathroom and use an amniotic fluid test strip I ordered off Amazon. &lt;em&gt;The baby isn’t moving enough. Is she just sleeping? Isn’t she supposed to be awake at night? Or is she just supposed to be awake when I am sleeping?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00493b7amj9cpo5z@published" data-word-count="233"&gt;I don’t sleep. Once I’ve tested for fluid, I pull out the handheld Doppler that I had asked my husband to hide from me, but I know all of his hiding places. I’m weeping softly now, trying to find the heartbeat, but all I hear is static and bumping noises. I wonder if the nurses have changed shifts and I can return to the hospital with minimal shame. I finally find the heartbeat, but the reading I catch seems too high. I Google &lt;em&gt;tachycardia&lt;/em&gt; again. The URLs I have visited before have gone from blue to purple, screaming out how many times I have clicked on them. Since the Doppler is making me more anxious, I take out an old fetal monitor that I convinced my doctor to give me. It no longer has paper to record the zigzags, but I can listen to my baby’s heartbeat for hours, and I often do. It’s big and clunky and reminds me of the typewriters I grew up around in the ’80s. I smear ultrasound gel that I ordered off Amazon on my belly and press the outdated and barely operative fetal monitor to my abdomen. I can’t stop crying. I’m so tired that I feel cold. I need to rest. I wish I could stop. But my daughter needs me more. I chase her like a fish in a vast, unknowable ocean — her flickering, teasing presence.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember noticing that the &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; looked like the crucifix I had seen when my family occasionally went to church. It occurred to me that if I didn’t make the &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; on my worksheet look symmetrical, I would be punished — for disrespecting God, I suppose. Soon I found myself tracing &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; shapes in the foggy glass of the double doors leading to the principal’s office, too. Did anyone notice that I was rooted to the spot, unable to move because I had to trace every near-invisible shape I saw, reaching on my tiptoes, trying to keep my index finger steady? If I didn’t do this, something terrible might happen — my family might die, or I might never fall asleep again, or a plane somewhere halfway across the world would crash and it would all be my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzd004c3b7a8srdr02y@published" data-word-count="183"&gt;Around that time, the kids in my class became fascinated by the story of Bloody Mary. Even now, as an adult who knows better, something catches in my throat as I write this. The legend went that if you turned several times in front of a mirror in the middle of the night, a full glass of water in hand, Bloody Mary would come out of the mirror and scratch you all over, leaving bruises and marks on your body. In the beginning, every time I saw a mirror, I looked away. Then, at some point, I could no longer drink water out of regular glasses nor sleep over at friends’ houses if they had mirrors in their bedrooms. Looking back, I think what scared me almost as much as the spectral figure of Mary was the idea that the spell was cast through numbers. I believed that if you turned twice instead of three times, she could be confined to the shadowy prison of the mirror — but that she was still waiting to escape. Anyone with OCD understands the particular allure of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzf004d3b7ahdpddfh6@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;I was officially diagnosed with OCD at age 9 in a therapist’s office in a small college town in Massachusetts. Back then, in the early ’90s, exposure therapy was a popular treatment for OCD. My particular focus was a fear of germs and public restrooms, so my doctor gave me a key to the semiprivate bathroom in her office suite. Once I’d conquered using that bathroom without freaking out or washing my hands repeatedly, I graduated to using a big public one in another area of the building. Exposure therapy works much like inoculation. If you are exposed to the thing you most fear and the worst doesn’t come to pass, you slowly realize, through repeated practice, that your fear was exaggerated, even fantastical. If you can stand the discomfort, even the anguish, of choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to perform a ritual, your intrusive thoughts begin to change accordingly, decreasing in frequency and intensity. It doesn’t work for everyone, but exposure therapy enabled me, in my adolescent years, to manage OCD with minimal disruptions. The urgency and power of my childhood fixations began to dim with time. I thought I was better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzf004e3b7aarj7bguw@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;But about ten years later, in September 2001, I started college, two planes hit the Twin Towers, and my OCD returned with ferocity. Suddenly, I was afraid of bombs, planes, and anthrax. My roommates stared at me in horror as I scrubbed my mouth with hand soap, convinced I’d ingested anthrax from a sealed envelope in my campus mailbox. My hypochondria worsened, as did the feeling that I personally had to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring. I saw someone stuff what was probably a sandwich bag into a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble trash can, and then I couldn’t focus, imagining that the person had planted a bomb and that I would be the one who did nothing. I informed the staff, and the entire bookstore was evacuated. Don’t they always say “If you see something, say something”? But it felt like I was always “seeing” things and that I couldn’t trust my own vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzh004f3b7a085ejtf2@published" data-word-count="134"&gt;Around the same time, I convinced myself I was actually losing my vision, visiting the student health center for what I worried was a detached retina. The eye doctors I followed up with politely informed me that they tend to see these injuries in football players and in the elderly. It would be highly unusual for an 18-year-old woman who didn’t participate in any contact sports to develop this problem. Then, in my freshman Psych 101 class, I became an utter cliché, convincing myself after reading my textbook that I had the beginnings of schizophrenia. I remember putting coins in the dorm laundry machine, my textbook in front of me, and hearing the blood pound in my ears as I discovered that schizophrenia was often comorbid with OCD and tended to manifest in young people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzi004g3b7alj2etzce@published" data-word-count="123"&gt;After visiting a counselor, I was funneled into an OCD study at Massachusetts General Hospital, where therapy was free and where I filled out countless questionnaires. But I was suffering, and I quickly got tired of being a guinea pig. So I left the study, and a psychiatrist family friend convinced me to try Prozac. Somehow, all of this time, I had never been medicated. As I stood in my childhood bedroom wondering if I would have to drop out of college because I couldn’t function, a close friend told me I would feel better soon. She said that SSRIs worked slowly and then all at once; she compared them to flowers that bloom overnight but that you can’t observe growing or opening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzj004h3b7auogahnz3@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;The Prozac worked. I felt hugely better. I threw myself into college, made friends, and dated. I wrote an honors thesis, got a research grant to study in Paris, and then went on to earn a master’s degree and a doctorate. I learned to be a teacher. I fell in love and had my heart broken, and fell in love again and had my heart broken again, and then fell in love once more. I published a book of poetry. I got married.&lt;/p&gt;

We bought a house. I got pregnant and had a miscarriage at 11 weeks, after seeing a heartbeat weeks earlier. I lapsed into grief and then committed myself with renewed dedication to getting pregnant again. I succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

But even for women who don’t suffer from OCD, pregnancy can feel scary and suspenseful. Several of my close friends who don’t have mental-health diagnoses have had moments of real terror and vulnerability while pregnant, spiraling over worries about miscarriage, stillbirth, or genetic conditions. In my case, these understandable fears, with the catalyst of OCD, alchemized into a toxic mixture. The illness that had waxed and waned, but that I’d mostly kept under control with Prozac, returned with a force that I had never experienced. Even in my most desperate moments at age 9 and again at 18, I never felt unsure, as I did while pregnant, about whether I could survive what my brain was putting me through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004l3b7ahyhv01zr@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Part of the reason my OCD exploded during my pregnancy is that my doctor told me to stop taking Prozac in my first trimester. I did what he said because I was so scared of a second miscarriage, even though there’s no compelling evidence to suggest that SSRIs factor in to pregnancy loss. I can still recall looking out the window from his office at the pedestrians below and envying people who were not pregnant for their ability to move through the world unencumbered. I felt claustrophobic in my own body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004m3b7ajeiftmgf@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;It was my husband’s birthday, and I was around 20 weeks pregnant when I first felt my baby move: a tapping and rolling motion, like something turning over. The panic came a few days later, when I was walking with my mother and husband in an art museum staring at ancient artifacts. “I felt the baby a few days ago, but I haven’t felt her since. Did she die?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I asked them, tears in my eyes. Doctors had already warned me that expecting daily, consistent movement at this stage would be unreasonable. But my mind couldn’t help circling to the last days of my previous pregnancy, when I’d walked in the sunshine from the parking lot to the building where I taught and the phrase “my body is a graveyard” ran through my head on a loop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004n3b7amxfpkmmw@published" data-word-count="174"&gt;By 24 weeks pregnant, many women are told to start tracking their baby’s movements; their OB/GYN mentions it in an appointment or they read about counting kicks in a pregnancy book as a way of preventing stillbirth. The advice has been reinforced by our app-flooded, data-drunk culture, and at first I was excited to have something concrete to measure. But when my doctor informed me that I had an anterior placenta, meaning movements would be more muffled and harder to discern, obsessions began to take over. I tried an app called “Count the Kicks” for a while, because it felt like externalizing my motherly intuition. But soon the app wasn’t enough, because I wasn’t content to count once or twice a day. Instead, I was counting almost every minute I was awake. I managed to keep teaching by pacing during my classes; I didn’t expect to feel the baby while I was walking, so moving kept my spiraling thoughts temporarily at bay. If my students noticed my restless body language, they didn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzn004o3b7a1pd1snnu@published" data-word-count="185"&gt;Friends and family tried to help me. They answered frantic texts at all hours, begged me to medicate or meditate, researched OCD and pregnancy, and by turns argued and agreed with me. I had a smart therapist who understood how badly I was suffering as I showed up, wild-eyed, to our sessions. My midwife was also sensitive and thoughtful and tried to reassure me that there is no universal, one-size-fits-all system for movement tracking. “Get to know your baby,” she said. “Know what is not normal for your baby.” My OB/GYN even put me back on a low dose of Prozac, but it had no impact. Everyone wanted to help, and to a woman more capable of living in a gray area, this might have been comforting. But I found myself believing that if I only concentrated hard enough, I could understand all the mysteries of my child’s behavior. Lying in a fetal position chugging pineapple juice, I would repeat my friends’ words, but they didn’t feel as true to me as the inner voice telling me to count, to check, just one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

I was fantasizing about something Californian and sunny, with support animals, a doting medical staff, and round-the-clock analysis of my fears. Hooked up to a monitor, I would enlist nurses to help me count baby kicks. My loved ones would make pilgrimages to see me swaddled in comforting surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

The nurses didn’t know what to do, so they gave me a sleeping pill, which I never would have taken without medical surveillance. I was hooked up all night, lying on my side in a hospital bed, and able to relax for the first time in months. If the baby stopped moving and died, it would be on their watch, not mine. I needed a break from vigilance and self-torture.&lt;/p&gt;

He told me that he and my psychiatrist had spoken. I told him I didn’t feel I could leave. He scheduled another ultrasound to give me reassurance but insisted that it was time to go. And though I left, I felt determined to come back very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzp004t3b7a5wi72ale@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Weeks later, while my husband was at a Mardi Gras party I had refused to attend with him, I drove to the hospital and stayed overnight again. At 37 weeks, I was full term, and my mind was made up: I would not go home.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzp004u3b7anw9x3kq1@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;Later that night, despite his misgivings, my husband joined me at the hospital. The OB on call was sympathetic and seemed to think it might be possible to induce me early. When she called my doctor, he vetoed the idea but allowed for an additional ultrasound. The tech informed us that the baby was showing signs of low energy and reduced movement, but that there was most likely no cause for alarm. Still, they decided to keep me another night for monitoring. My husband went home to get some rest; he had work the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004v3b7amvcfkrt8@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;In the morning, a Monday, he returned with the intention of bringing me home. But as a precaution, they performed a biophysical profile, a special kind of ultrasound combined with a non-stress test for high-risk pregnancies. For the first time, my baby failed the test. My doctor came in and told us we would have our baby in the next hour, because I needed an emergency C-section. I was stunned, horrified, and giddy. &lt;em&gt;How was it possible that all of my unfounded obsessions had finally culminated in a measurable problem — a real, medical concern for the baby? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004w3b7aynburppy@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;As I was wheeled into the OR, I felt hope for the first time in months. I wondered if it was possible that a new life — both for me and for my baby — was about to start. I was awake throughout the surgery, and I felt pressure but no pain. The doctors were chatting casually with each other. And then I felt something immeasurably heavy lifted out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004x3b7asd6zz3y6@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;My doctor showed me the umbilical cord, which had two huge knots and had been wrapped several times around my daughter’s neck. The expression on his face was bizarre, almost sheepish. My husband and I read it as an admission — that maybe I had been right, after being wrong so many times. My OCD was real and destructive. But ironically, it may have saved my daughter’s life. I will never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004y3b7a6nlxihrl@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;My husband was with our daughter in her first moments; she had a little trouble breathing but was healthy and strong and nearly seven pounds. My mother got on a plane and was there to hold her on her first day of life. Then, after four days of pumping colostrum and wincing as I hobbled to the bathroom, blood tumbling out in clots every time I stood up, it was time to go. We drove our daughter home so slowly. I remember a flood of euphoria. Now she was outside of me. Now I could see her. Now I would know if she was okay or if she needed help. Now other people could observe her too. She was no longer stuck in the black box of my body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr004z3b7aqqwoeofz@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Back on the full dose of my SSRI, many of my obsessions vanished, and the arrival of more mundane fixations — &lt;em&gt;Am I changing her diaper often enough? Is she getting enough milk? &lt;/em&gt;— was a welcome development. I had relapses, but after going to my daughter’s bassinet for the fifth time to check on her breathing or to make sure her swaddle wasn’t too hot or too tight, something in my brain allowed me to stop. Five was enough. No need for a sixth or seventh visit.&lt;/p&gt;

But my pregnancy had served as a rehearsal for those dangers — a kind of exposure therapy to larger unknowns. It had inoculated me, at least a little bit, to motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

I told my therapist, and she immediately grew concerned. I could hear the fear in my parents’ voices, too. Everyone was afraid they would lose me again. &lt;em&gt;I’m not going to go down this rabbit hole&lt;/em&gt;, I remember saying out loud in my office. &lt;em&gt;I’m not going to lose my mind again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr00543b7a8el3dw3g@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Convinced, maybe unfairly, that another woman would be more likely to understand the profound responsibility and disorientation caused by a body gestating within my own, I sought out a female doctor. One of the first things she told me was that she would not be changing my SSRI prescription, and that we would closely monitor me for signs of my OCD reemerging. She was incredulous that I had ever been advised to stop my treatment. Together, my therapist and I came up with tactics to try to preempt OCD thoughts from taking over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzs00553b7a8mp8p37v@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Still, when I reached 20 weeks and kick counting became plausible, I held my daughter on my lap and noticed that I couldn’t feel the baby inside — and the old panic resurfaced. I told myself that after I put her to sleep I could go to the hospital. But sure enough, as I grabbed the keys to the car and headed to the garage, I felt her brother again. With this pregnancy, I didn’t have an anterior placenta and the movements were much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzs00563b7aybyu1ct9@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;So I went back inside, dropped the keys on my bedside table (close by, just in case), and crawled into bed next to my husband. For a few minutes, he counted with me — my face on his shoulder, our son kicking his back — and then we stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance, the heart is one of the few tissues in the human body that can't repair damage very well – or at least, that's what has long been presumed. Scientists in Australia have now caught heart muscle cells freely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-reveals-more-about-how-the-heart-repairs-itself-after-a-heart-attack"&gt;regenerating&lt;/a&gt; after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something impedes blood flow, the lack of oxygen kills heart cells. The organ can patch itself up with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"&gt;scar tissue&lt;/a&gt;, but this inelastic, fibrous tissue doesn't beat, making the heart less efficient. These irregularities can eventually lead to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;further attacks&lt;/a&gt; and heart failure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice seem to be lucky enough to have hearts that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-technique-could-be-used-to-repair-the-heart-after-a-heart-attack"&gt;regenerate&lt;/a&gt;, at least partly. Their cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06585-5"&gt;have been seen&lt;/a&gt; dividing again after a heart attack, but human heart cells aren't nearly so sprightly after injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-hearts-may-have-hidden-self-healing-powers-study-finds"&gt;Damaged Hearts May Have Hidden Self-Healing Powers, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research shows that while the heart is left scarred after a heart attack, it produces new muscle cells, which opens up new possibilities," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/human-heart-regrows-muscle-cells-after-heart-attack-world-first-study-shows"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Robert Hume, first author of the study and cardiologist at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this new discovery of regrowing muscle cells is exciting, it isn't enough to prevent the devastating effects of a heart attack. Therefore, in time, we hope to develop therapies that can amplify the heart's natural ability to produce new cells and regenerate the heart after an attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189598" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-642x864.png" alt="Human Heart Tissue Can Regenerate After a Heart Attack, New Study Shows" class="wp-image-189598 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-642x864.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-501x675.png 501w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-768x1034.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-1141x1536.png 1141w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney-600x808.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Heart-cells-replicating-credit-Dr-Robert-Hume-University-of-Sydney.png 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189598" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The pink sections indicate human heart cells replicating.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2oszd00183b79m4ju0us3@published"&gt;I have been dating “Cesar” for several months now. I’m not saying he is “the one” yet, although we get along great and our future together looks promising. But (there always seems to be a “but”), there is something about him that I don’t know if I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2ot1i00193b79mhkbskyb@published"&gt;We have been intimate, but due to our work schedules, we had never spent the night together until the last couple of weekends. Cesar, when he sleeps, sleeps on top of the covers (wearing pajamas) and basically looks like he is in a coffin. Flat on his back, no pillow, arms crossed over his chest, never moving from the time we say, “Goodnight” until one of us wakes up for the day. He says he is a hot sleeper, so that is why he doesn’t need covers, and that he “hypnotizes/hibernates” himself before going to sleep by focusing on lowering his breathing rate and completely relaxing his body.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn33z6500593b797vfxdhbs@published"&gt;One time, I honestly thought he was dead because I could not hear him breathe, and his skin actually felt cooler to the touch. It kind of freaks me out if I happen to get up to use the bathroom and come back to what looks like a dead man lying on the bed. Plus, with him on top of the covers and me under the covers (I need a cover over me to sleep), there is no cuddling during the night, which I have enjoyed with previous relationships. Any suggestions on how to get over this? We are in our mid-20s, so the chance of him actually being dead is quite slim.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2ot89001c3b79u2oywys2@published"&gt;Do you know how much money and energy people spend on magnesium, melatonin, sleep hygiene habits, meditation apps, and limiting blue light and caffeine after 2 p.m. to achieve what Cesar does with the power of his mind? I’m impressed! And I actually think this hypnosis trick is a great sign of his ability to manage his body and mind. If the two of you end up getting married and you miss your connecting flight on the way to your honeymoon, guess who’s not going to be red-faced and yelling at an airline employee? Cesar. He’ll take a few deep breaths, hypnotize himself into a cool, logical mindset, and figure out the next steps. Plus, he’s not snoring or anything? This is a win!&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2otaf001d3b791k4ih2ba@published"&gt;I hate that you’re not getting to cuddle in your sleep, but if you do want to snuggle up to his corpse-like body, you could just place a small comforter over only yourself and stick an arm out to drape over him. It doesn’t sound like he’ll give a lot back, but it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

Your checking his breathing and feeling his skin when you had absolutely no reason to believe he’d passed away (he’s not a three-day-old infant on his first night home from the hospital, and it’s not as if you found him lying on the bathroom floor) is concerning and makes me think the solution involves managing your anxiety. Only you know whether this is a larger issue in your life, but in the meantime, maybe you could adopt a mantra like, “He’s safe, and he’s having a wonderful night of sleep. I will do the same.” Or ask him to teach you to self-hypnotize so you won’t be awake to worry about him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jf001p3b79byi1md7d@published"&gt;I have a neighbor I’m concerned about. She has two kids in the 7 to 10 age range, which is a little older than my kids, and we’ve done occasional playdates over several years where we chat while the kids play, but that’s it. I’ve met her husband briefly. She doesn’t work, and he travels for work and is gone for weeks at a time. She’s always been extremely flaky, often canceling at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jg001q3b79dgy3r09z@published"&gt;Over a year ago, that turned into every plan getting cancelled, and I stopped trying, figuring it wasn’t a priority for them. Then recently, she called me out of the blue. She was talking very fast, in a high, child-like voice. She didn’t make much sense, but from what I could gather, her husband has called the police on her multiple times in the past year, the last time leading to an involuntary stay in a psychiatric ward. She was making claims about her husband and mother both being narcissists who were sabotaging her, repeating herself a lot, and seemed to be in a state of panic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jg001r3b79t3pds63r@published"&gt;Since then, she’s sent me several bursts of texts about some sort of volunteer work she’s apparently trying to turn into a job that is tangentially related to my field, sort of asking for advice, but never giving me enough information that I could actually give any, and filled with apologies for bothering me. I’ve tried several times to make plans with her—lunch or a walk—and I’ve expressed concern for her and directed her to mental health resources. She agrees to plans but always cancels, and insists she has neurodiverse needs (I think self-diagnosed) that require very specialized professional skills.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jh001s3b7975e4mib0@published"&gt;So, my question: What, if anything, can or should I be doing here? She’s clearly struggling, but we aren’t close. If it were just her, I would leave it at that. But I worry about her kids. I don’t know her husband well enough to approach him; I don’t even know if he is a safe person. I sense that she has no close friends and spends most of her time alone in her house while the kids are in school and her husband is gone. She’s clearly mentally unwell, but I don’t know if he is part of the reason for that. I think I’m doing everything I can from where I’m at, but if you have any outside suggestions, I would much appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jh001v3b79j1w0a5q1@published"&gt;Reading your letter makes me think about how hard it is for people to help spouses, siblings, and best friends who are in distress, living in chaos, or struggling with mental health issues. They often write to me feeling completely powerless to make changes in their loved ones’ lives, because we can’t force people to do anything they don’t want to do. If it’s hard for them, who are much more directly involved in the situation, it would be nearly impossible for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6ji001w3b79hwn1ub27@published"&gt;You don’t have the closeness, let alone the information about what your friend is going through, to be doing more. Even if you did, your power to push your friend toward professional help would be pretty minimal. That’s too bad, but on the other hand, I hope knowing this makes you feel a little less responsible for doing something to get to the bottom of her problems and solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6ji001x3b79t5xlqwbk@published"&gt;That said, I do have two practical ideas about ways you could help her out a little bit. The first is something you’re already doing: Listen to her. Whether she’s talking about her marriage, her job search, or her neurodivergence, just hear her out and affirm the way she’s feeling. You don’t need to understand all the details—or even feel sure that they’re grounded in reality—to say, “That must have been so painful” or, “You didn’t deserve that” when she reports on the way her husband and others are treating her, or “This is really exciting for you” when she’s sharing details about her hopes for her career. While fixing everything for her would be great, there’s something to be said for making sure she knows she’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jj001y3b79ons60wqj@published"&gt;Second, go get those kids and bring them to your house for a sleepover or a weekend if everyone is comfortable with that. They’re already friends with your children. Even if it turns out that nothing is wrong beyond her husband traveling a lot, she could use a break.&lt;/p&gt;

Until, that is, we spend time with them in their home. Then the dynamic changes, and the cool, calm woman I know turns into a nervous child.&lt;/p&gt;

Our latest visit started with her hissing and tutting at everything I did, moved on to constantly correcting the kids and me, and ended with her screaming, “You’re useless” at me because I used the “wrong” knife to cut onions. I stopped what I was doing, grabbed the kids, and left. My phone started blowing up on the way home as she left a series of increasingly ugly messages while she got sloppy drunk with her sister. I was so worried about her state of mind that I shut down our joint bank account for fear of some kind of revenge. It was bad.&lt;/p&gt;

We haven’t spoken outside of a few texts. The kids are in pieces. I don’t know what to tell them because I don’t know whether our marriage will survive. My in-laws texted me an apology, but my (ex?-)wife has only communicated anger and disappointment. We’ve been married 18 years, and every visit to her parents has gone badly, but never like this. I’ve begun separating our assets because I don’t see any way back from some of the messages she sent, particularly the ones in which she wished me and the kids harm. Where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

I wondered if your wife had painful childhood experiences that caused her anxiety to really peak at home, and if you could help her manage her anxiety, while also protecting yourself from having to absorb it.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t need the rest of the details. They don’t matter. The marriage is over.

That's why there's overlap between the anti-inflammatory, Mediterranean, and HEI diets. &lt;br data-node-id="14.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-these-diets-be-helpful-for-lowering-the-risk-of-rheumatoid-arthritis" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Why might these diets be helpful for lowering the risk of rheumatoid arthritis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There could be a few things happening here. "We know RA is much more of an environmental than a genetic condition, and that healthy dietary pattern improves many aspects of human health, including immune function," Dr. Kronzer says. "While we don’t know the precise mechanism at play here, I speculate it could be through general anti-inflammatory properties of healthy diet or favorable changes to the microbiome, among other possibilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When you reduce chronic systemic inflammation in the body it also lowers oxidative stress, “both of which play a role in triggering autoimmune responses,” adds  &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/orthopedics/sports-medicine/team/sports-dietitians/kacie-vavrek" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/orthopedics/sports-medicine/team/sports-dietitians/kacie-vavrek" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kacie Vavrek, RD" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Kacie Vavrek, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Diets that are rich in omega-3 fats, fiber, and antioxidants have been linked with lower markers of inflammation and may support immune regulation, “potentially reducing the likelihood of developing rheumatoid arthritis or delaying disease onset,” Vavrek says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Gans stresses that “diet isn’t a cure or a guarantee,” but notes that people who consistently follow these healthier eating patterns have a lower risk of developing RA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-eat-to-potentially-lower-your-risk-of-rheumatoid-arthritis" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;How to eat to potentially lower your risk of rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While these diets are slightly different, they have a lot in common. “There are lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish, with fewer sugary foods, refined carbs, and highly processed meats,” Gans says. (Anti-inflammatory diets in particular also usually include herbs and spices like turmeric and ginger, Vavrek says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Of course, RA is influenced by more than what you eat. If you’re concerned about your risk of developing the disease or want to know what you can do to better manage it, check in with a healthcare provider.

They were both on the fence when they met, but now Madison really wants to be a mom. They have been in marriage counseling for two years now to try to resolve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2h1lm00193b79njdqugid@published"&gt;Trey keeps saying that he’s almost there, and with a bit more time, he will be ready for kids. However, a few nights ago, we were out for drinks, and Trey confessed to me that he made up his mind years ago. He does not want children, but he wants to stay married to Madison. He told me that he is intentionally giving her false hope, and is hoping that she will either change her mind, or that he will “run out the clock” so she will be too old to have kids anyway. I told him that he needs to be honest with Madison and stop wasting her time, but he refuses to tell her the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

Trey is a very close friend of many years, and while Madison and I are friends as well, we are not nearly as close, and we don’t hang out one-on-one. I am absolutely disgusted by this revelation and think she deserves to know, but I’m also not sure if it’s my place, or if she will even believe me. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

Given that Trey is the friend you’re closer to, it probably doesn’t make sense for you to report this disturbing news to Madison. Unless learning about how dishonest, cowardly, and cruel Trey is changes the way you feel about him, and you’re ready to let him go as a friend. I hope this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s not someone you can count on, and you should feel not only disgusted, but also worried. If that resonates with you, tell Madison the truth and tell him he’s “run out the clock” on your &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;friendship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The highly contagious virus has also spread onward to North Carolina, Ohio and Washington state, and similar outbreaks are unfurling in Arizona and Utah as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The outbreak, which first began in Texas a year ago this week, has spread to most US states – and as the US passes the one-year mark, its measles-elimination status will probably end, a symbol indicating an expected wave of year-round preventable disease. The outbreak has been plagued by misinformation, with Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services and longtime vaccine critic, framing measles vaccination as a personal choice and promoting unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vast majority of those infected are children, and most of them did not receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine). Last year, there were 2,242 confirmed cases of measles across 44 states, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There have already been 171 measles cases reported in nine states in 2026 – and that number does not include the jump in cases reported by South Carolina on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think it’s just the new normal, unfortunately, that public health departments have to be responding to,” said Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, who oversaw the city’s response to the west &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; measles cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2026, measles will probably percolate in more communities with low vaccination rates and then put pressure on vulnerable children and adults even in highly vaccinated communities, she said. And measles isn’t the only fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Measles is the canary in the coalmine,” Wells said. “As we see lower and lower vaccination rates, we could see an outbreak of rubella or polio or some of these other vaccine-preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because it is so highly contagious – it can linger in the air in a room for two hours – measles typically spreads more quickly than other infectious diseases. But preventable illnesses like polio, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough are not far behind a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Measles is a bellwether,” said James Alwine, emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania, a virologist, and a member of the coordinating committee of Defend Public Health. “It means that your vaccination level is so low that all the other vaccine-preventable diseases will come up with time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination rates are falling throughout the US as exemptions from school mandates increase, according to new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2843870" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama). Kennedy has been a “key figure” in growing anti-vaccine sentiment for decades, “denigrating vaccines in general, specifically the MMR vaccine, trying to link it with autism when there’s no link”, said Rob Davidson, an emergency physician in western Michigan and executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care – adding that the danger had increased now Kennedy has “the largest megaphone of public health in the country, maybe in the world”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Davidson has been a doctor for 28 years, and like many of his peers, he has never seen a case of measles – all because of vaccines, he said. Now, he is preparing for the day he might encounter the disease in a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is something we have to be thinking about on a regular basis again,” he said. “It is a gut punch. It didn’t have to be this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 531 people are currently in quarantine and 85 in isolation, and eight people have been hospitalized with measles since the start of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We feel like we’re really kind of staring over the edge, knowing that this is about to get a lot worse,” Johnathon Elkes, an emergency medicine physician at Prisma Health in Greenville, South Carolina, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-clemson-university-rcna254787" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Helmut Albrecht, an infectious disease specialist at Prisma Health, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/16/nx-s1-5677299/measles-outbreak-vaccines-kids-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pleaded&lt;/a&gt; with the public on Friday to get vaccinated: “We have right now the largest outbreak in the US, and it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In North Carolina, seven out of eight cases &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/communicable-disease/infectious-respiratory-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-cases-and-outbreaks-north-carolina?mc_cid=ea05c7dbf5&amp;amp;mc_eid=65d099f200" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks were linked to the South Carolina outbreak. At least three children each in Ohio and Washington have also been sickened in the spiraling outbreak, which was first detected in Texas nearly a year ago. The virus is spreading in other states as well. Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; 217 cases and nine hospitalizations in this outbreak, which started for them in August, and Utah has had &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;210 cases&lt;/a&gt; since its first case was detected in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Friday said it planned to review in April the measles elimination status of the US and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; given the ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The outbreak began a year ago, on 20 January 2025, when the first child in Texas who tested positive for measles developed a rash. When Wells heard that two children had tested positive and needed to be hospitalized, she feared, correctly, that it was the tip of the iceberg, since one in five children with measles need to be hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our investigation revealed that there were many, many, many sick children with measles on the ground,” Wells said. “We were already in a full-blown outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Texas cluster officially &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; in August after 762 confirmed cases, 99 hospitalizations, and the deaths of two young children. But by then, the outbreak had already widened to other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Losing the US measles elimination status is a warning, Wells said: “We’re now entering an era where we’re going to see outbreaks in these unvaccinated communities, and then I think those outbreaks will start putting pressure on other, more-vaccinated communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children under the age of one or with health conditions are the most vulnerable even in highly vaccinated communities. It is a particular concern in healthcare settings, where a child undergoing cancer treatment might come into contact with a measles patient – especially because the early symptoms of measles are a cough and runny nose; the telltale rash only sets in later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the Texas outbreak, Lubbock public health gave out thousands more MMR vaccines than usual, and other areas of the state also mobilized a response, with pharmacies &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seeing a surge in demand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some parents in Lubbock vaccinated their infants early – babies over the age of six months can get the shot early, as long as they receive a third shot later, and while the second dose is usually recommended at age four, young children can receive it earlier. School nurses reached out to the families of students who were behind on vaccinations or who had opted out for non-medical reasons, letting them know about the safety and importance of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We had parents come into our clinics who had never vaccinated their children, but seeing the disease and hearing about it on the news, they said: ‘Oh, this is real. Let me get my child vaccinated,’” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But experts are worried by the recent announcement that the US will no longer fully recommend several important vaccines in childhood, which could create access issues and further confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Putting them on a non-recommended list is going to make people think that maybe they’re not important, maybe they’re not needed,” Alwine said. School mandates are also coming under fire by anti-vaccine advocates, particularly now that several recommendations have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to make sure that vaccines are available and that individuals know how life-saving vaccines can be,” Wells said. “The majority of parents from both political sides believe in vaccines and want to see kids being vaccinated. And we need to make sure that those parents, and people who would really be impacted if those vaccination rates start dropping in schools, really speak out and speak up about [how] it’s important that we keep kids vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The resurgence of preventable illness is straining an already overburdened health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Undoubtedly we’re going to see more meningitis, hepatitis, RSV, rotavirus – all the things that they just took off the [full] recommendation list,” said Davidson. The thought of seeing more illness was “gutting”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Local public health departments all over the country are now preparing for their own cases of measles and other threats. One of Wells’s top pieces of advice is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/measles-texas-lessons-vaccination" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;improving ties&lt;/a&gt; with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to have more boots on the ground, working with communities, for all different types of health outcomes and health concerns,” she said. Those efforts can go a long way in identifying cases before they explode into an outbreak – and they can result in important conversations about why these diseases are such a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’ve lived in the golden age of medicine for so long that there are so many people who have never seen these diseases, don’t even think about them, don’t even know they exist any more,” Alwine said. “Or people think they’ve been eliminated, but they’re not. They’re just waiting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZzNHQkhWWVN3VThMRW1ra3RWQk5GVUlIa2xuQWFHTDhBd0lqZTczMXQtaE5MaFpDZVJUZ0xMNVA5N3lHblRUQnNxRzBBWXVlM05aTmh4d3U3dDdaTFAyMEQyZ252bGxER1JpaTdWM1AtLUFEbmh0LV9CeE5jTE83NFctYw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家分享如何识别心脏病发作的第一个症状，无症状： “很少感觉像刺痛的刺痛” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-shares-how-to-identify-1st-sign-of-heart-attack-silent-symptoms-rarely-feels-like-sharp-stabbing-pain-101768988093240.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;Medical professionals and health enthusiasts have been saying it again and again that your heart is one of the most important organs in your body.

However, he highlighted that it rarely feels like a sharp, stabbing pain; instead, patients often describe it as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sensation of heavy pressure or squeezing (like an ‘elephant sitting on my chest’).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dull ache or fullness in the centre of the chest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort that lasts for more than a few minutes or that comes and goes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The discomfort doesn't always begin inside your chest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist noted that it is a common misconception that heart attacks only affect the chest. Instead, the first symptom of a heart attack might actually travel or appear in other areas due to shared nerve pathways. Dr Dinesh stated, pay close attention if you feel unexplained discomfort in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The left arm:&lt;/strong&gt; A classic sign, but it can also occur in both arms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The jaw and neck:&lt;/strong&gt; Often mistaken for a toothache or a sore throat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The back:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically between the shoulder blades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The ‘silent’ symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr Dinesh stressed, “Women, elderly individuals, and those with diabetes are more likely to experience 'atypical' symptoms.” For these groups, he pointed out that the first sign might not be pain at all, but rather:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden, extreme fatigue that feels like you’ve run a marathon while standing still.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath without any physical exertion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or cold sweats, which are frequently mistaken for the flu or food poisoning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Lastly, Dr Dinesh shared the ‘golden rule’ if you ever experience a sudden, unusual sensation from the waist up that feels ‘wrong’: “Don't wait to see if it passes.&lt;/span&gt; Calling emergency services immediately is the best way to ensure a positive outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Her mother, Elise, thought Lola was just growing fast because of genes inherited from her father. But when she noticed that Lola had grown pubic hair too, she was floored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/vbmfnrsssw" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_23569084.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Collection: Coming of age: the emerging science of adolescence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visit to an endocrinologist in 2023 confirmed that Lola’s brain was already producing hormones that had kick-started puberty. Lola had also been struggling emotionally. “She would have panic attacks every day at school,” says Elise, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and asked that her surname and Lola’s real name be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although eight might seem young to start puberty, it’s not as rare as it once was. Data show that girls around the world are entering puberty younger than before. In the 1840s, the average age of first menstruation, or menarche, was about 16 or 17; today, it’s around 12. The average age for onset of breast development fell from 11 years in the 1960s to around 9 or 10 years in the United States by the 1990s. Some research hints that the trend mysteriously accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Although some data suggest that puberty is happening earlier for boys too, the shift seems to be less pronounced.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found a range of possible drivers for this change, with increasing body weight and obesity almost certainly playing a part. Some researchers suspect that exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals or stress during childhood could be pushing puberty earlier, but studies have produced conflicting results. The trend has prompted the international organization the Endocrine Society to develop clinical-practice guidelines on puberty, to be published in mid-2026. The guidelines will reconsider how to treat girls on the border between typical and ‘precocious’ puberty, which has commonly been defined as before the age of eight in girls, but that some specialists argue should be younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research over the past few years is also making the health risks of early puberty increasingly clear. Studies have linked it to greater risk of conditions including obesity, heart disease, breast cancer, depression and anxiety. Other research suggests that children who go through puberty earlier are more likely to experience discrimination because of their race or ethnicity, or otherwise be treated differently from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families, researchers and clinicians are now trying to work out how best to adapt and when to intervene. This might involve medications to pause the process, but also better support and puberty education for children to protect them from some of the psychological and social risks. “We want to intervene right in that moment before people start internalizing some of those feelings of being othered,” says Michael Curtis, a family social scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New normal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, puberty begins when the brain’s hypothalamus begins producing pulses of gondatropin-releasing hormone. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;What triggers this process isn’t fully understood&lt;/a&gt; — it’s probably a complex interaction between genes and environmental factors. But the result is a hormonal cascade that leads to the release of the sex hormones oestrogen (in girls) and testosterone (in boys), which drive physical changes, including menarche. (The binary terms ‘girls’ and ‘boys’ are used in this article to reflect language used in studies and by interviewees.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop in average age of menarche from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century is often attributed to improvements in health, such as reductions in infectious disease and malnutrition (see ‘Younger puberty’). This probably sped up growth and sexual maturation. Most researchers assumed that the timing of puberty had remained relatively stable since then. “Studies from the 1960s showed that it was kind of levelling off at 12 and a half years,” says Paul Kaplowitz, a retired paediatric endocrinologist who was at Children’s National Hospital in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_51957178.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_51957178.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Younger puberty.

They observed that breast development is the first outward sign of puberty in girls and that it begins around 11 years old, on average. (For boys, the onset of puberty&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was closer to 12.) The ‘Tanner stages’, which demarcate five stages of progress towards sexual maturity, became widely used in medicine and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, however, Marcia Herman-Giddens was questioning Tanner’s timings. As part of her work as a physician’s associate at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, Herman-Giddens had examined thousands of girls in the United States and observed that some were developing breasts and pubic hair “way younger than the Tanner standards”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman-Giddens and her team set out to develop benchmarks for US children. With the help of physicians from across the country, they collected data on pubertal timing from around 17,000 girls who had undergone physical examinations in physician offices between 1992 and 1993. This showed that the mean age at which breast development started was just under ten years old for white girls and nine years for Black girls. It was the first large study to suggest that puberty was beginning much earlier than Tanner had suggested, at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00933-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_50815566.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Do smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, when the team’s findings were published&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the reaction among the scientific community was, largely, disbelief. Anders Juul, a paediatric endocrinologist at the University of Copenhagen, didn’t see similar figures in Denmark and, with obesity on the rise, he suspected that US physicians had mistaken fat tissue for growing breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, however, a second US study reached a similar conclusion&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Herman-Giddens. And in 2009, Juul and his team reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that the mean age of breast development in Copenhagen had fallen from just under 11 years in the early 1990s to just under 10 in the mid-2000s. The change couldn’t be attributed to increased weight, because the girls’ body mass index (BMI) had not changed. “To our surprise, there were no differences in obesity between the old cohort and the more contemporary cohort,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 meta-analysis of 30 studies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — and the most recent comprehensive review of global trends — revealed that the median age of breast development fell by almost three months each decade between 1977 and 2013. The United States had the earliest onset (a median of 8.8–10.3 years), Africa had the latest (10.1–13.2 years) and Europe and Asia fell in between. An update&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to this study, presented at a 2025 European endocrinology meeting, shows that the trend has continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers don’t know whether puberty will continue occurring even earlier or at what point it might hit a biological floor. Globally, physicians now typically consider puberty onset between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls as in the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puberty puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have been trying to work out why puberty is starting earlier. Of their handful of plausible hypotheses, the worsening obesity epidemic tops the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02983-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02983-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;obesity rates have risen&lt;/a&gt; from around 2% of children and adolescents in 1990 to around 8% in 2022, and from around 11% to more than 20% in the United States, according to the World Health Organization. A 2022 study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of nearly 130,000 US children found a clear association between obesity and earlier puberty in children. “It is beyond any doubt that obesity is a major driver,” says geneticist John Perry, who studies growth and reproduction at the University of Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way in which body weight influences puberty is through leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. This can interact with the brain circuits that control development and reproduction. “We don’t think that leptin initiates puberty,” Kaplowitz says. “But it’s important for puberty to progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_15474102.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Who exactly counts as an adolescent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers, including Juul, suspect that hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment could be at least partly responsible for advancing puberty. They point in particular to chemicals found in plastics, such as phthalates, forever chemicals called PFAS and synthetic fragrances, all of which gained widespread use in the twentieth century. These compounds can interfere with hormones by mimicking them or disrupting their activity. But results are inconsistent, and proving a link to any single substance has been incredibly difficult. “There haven’t been really any good studies that have shown this in a way that everybody says, ‘yep, that’s the answer’,” Kaplowitz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third possible piece of the puzzle is psychological stress. Some research suggests that girls who encounter stressors such as domestic violence, abuse, poverty and discrimination are more likely to start puberty at a younger age than those who do not. One 2022 longitudinal study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that physical or emotional abuse in early life was linked to earlier menarche in US girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress doesn’t necessarily explain the population-wide shift in the timing of puberty — there’s no rise in childhood stressors that clearly matches the downward trend in the onset of puberty. But it might interact with excess body weight, says Lauren Houghton, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York City. Her unpublished research suggests that girls who experience high levels of stress, have elevated stress hormones and a high BMI start developing breasts, on average, seven months earlier than do girls who experience low levels of stress and have a low BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress might also be a reason why more girls entered puberty early during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the years preceding it. Soon after the pandemic began in 2020, paediatric endocrinologists in Italy noticed that the number of referrals for precocious puberty soared. They later reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that 41% of those referred in 2020 met the criteria for the condition, compared with 26% in 2019. Studies from other countries have revealed a similar phenomenon and some suggest that puberty progressed faster too&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We saw “truncated and shorter puberty”, says Louise Greenspan, a paediatric endocrinologist at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

According to Amati, this life stage is when we finish building bones and muscle, and start spending hours studying, working, and socialising – all of which increase nutrient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Adolescence and early adulthood are another big window of opportunity for nutrition," says Amati. "In the 20s, growth slows, but it's still a crucial decade for establishing habits that protect heart and brain health in later life. We see that a lot of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/lifestyle-pattern-during-adolescence-is-associated-with-cardiovascular-risk-markers-in-young-adults-results-from-the-donald-cohort-study/C26C70796BF74B030C5937314CF51725" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;groundwork for cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; is already being laid in this age group, even though symptoms appear much later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188(05)00121-X/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;our teens, the body needs more of several nutrients&lt;/a&gt; compared to later adulthood. This includes calcium, vitamin D and iron – which is especially important for those who menstruate. Protein and B vitamins are also important, Amati says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what does this diet look like? According to Amati, teens and young adults should follow a largely plant-based diet and avoid ultra-processed foods. So lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, beans, nuts, lentils and seeds. It's also important to have an adequate amount of protein for every meal, which can also be plant-based, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Studies show that following such a diet doesn't just benefit the body, it can impact mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNekdXSDcwWUY5NzFxbnQ5NVhGWEtPelFobDIxWW1aWkN6R3JCcFFRcW10eTlGS2dPb0UzbWlHWlNmaHhMMWxVM3YzcWlPSUh4NVBaLW1iSWRBM0FKbGxtc0tGYnBNeGk5S29yNXFxM21PN2IxWjFrMkVSQWNEcUlpWTdpemlsNW1XUEhpcEc0LXhyZ1dIV2UxUExXeGRqUUJ3</guid></item><item><title>我的前列腺癌筛查弊大于利吗？ - statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/21/what-psa-screening-gets-wrong-prostate-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, at age 55, I underwent my first digital rectal exam. The routine check set me on a 15-year path that transformed me from a medical editor on a daily newspaper in Chicago into an international advocate for men navigating the labyrinth of low-risk prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My exam was uneventful. My doctor, after the requisite “finger wave,” remarked, “Your prostate is small.” I also didn’t question that day the accompanying blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein enzyme that liquefies sperm to help ejaculation. My doctor failed to warn me how this simple test placed me at ground zero of a medical firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors began testing PSA levels in the 1980s to monitor diagnosed cancers. By the early 1990s, researchers promoted it for widespread screening to detect prostate cancer in asymptomatic men. Within two years of being implemented, prostate cancer diagnoses doubled, creating a testing-induced “epidemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;American men with lower-risk cancers lined up for prostatectomies, paying a steep price: 15% to 20% developed urinary incontinence, 50% to 60% faced significant erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some general practitioners and urologists elsewhere in the world were slow to adopt PSA testing because of concern about overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In 2012, the same concerns led the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to recommend against using the PSA test as a screening tool in the general population. That debate still continues, even as new prostate cancers are &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/prostate-cancer-surge-in-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;projected to double&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. During the same period, deaths from prostate cancer are predicted to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/prostate-cancer-surge-in-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increase globally by 85%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem? Over half of men treated for prostate cancer have low-risk “autopsy” cancers — silent tumors that would never cause problems and only would have been discovered in an autopsy. About 80% of 80-year-olds harbor such cancers, but die from heart disease, strokes, accidents — almost anything but prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;PSA, it turns out, is a powerful but blunt instrument. It’s sensitive but not specific. Around 20% of men with prostate cancer have normal PSA levels, while only 25% to 30% of those biopsied for elevated PSA actually have cancer. In other words, roughly 70% to 75% of “PSA-positive” screens are false alarms. The test is excellent for tracking known disease, but generally terrible as a standalone cancer detector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My own PSA was 3.9 in 2002, high enough to lead to a biopsy, which found a single core of low-risk, Gleason 6/Grade Group 1 cancer — just under the standard 4.0 threshold. By my second biopsy, my PSA had dropped to 3.6. Yet my first urologist, a private practitioner who had a financial incentive to operate,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tried to rush me into his operating room&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the following week. My second urologist, at the University of Chicago, was paid the same salary whether he operated or not. He told me I didn’t need surgery and could likely live the rest of my life without being treated. He predicted my cancer would not grow in a decade. My PSA has stabilized between 4.8 and 5.2, well below the 6.5 average at my current age, 78.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Actually, within a year of diagnosis, my cancer “disappeared” and has not been seen in four subsequent annual biopsies nor in two prebiopsy MRIs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The doctors disagree on what happened. Some think I had a spontaneous remission. Most think my cancer is just hiding. Whatever the case, I came this close to undergoing surgery I didn’t need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about prostate cancer, the most common solid cancer diagnosed in American men and the second most deadly: Like most cancers, there are few absolutes. Doctors still debate the value of PSAs — some don’t recommend the tests even as many urologists and advocates say a lack of PSA screening has led in recent years to an outbreak of incurable metastatic prostate cancer, the kind President Biden has. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The international urology community still debates the basics of treating prostate cancer: whether low-risk cancer, the kind I was diagnosed with, should even be called a cancer; which type of biopsy is safest; and whether transrectal biopsies, the most common kind in the U.S., are killing men by giving them sepsis. And of course, clinicians and researchers debate how to use the PSA test, which some doctors say is the “best test they have” — even though it is unreliable, and overdiagnoses cancers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International practice diverges sharply from American dogma. U.S. guidelines generally remain stuck at 4.0 nanograms per milliliter as the threshold for starting cancer surveillance for everyone, though many academic centers now use 3.0 ng/mL for younger men. The U.K.’s independent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) takes an age-graded approach: 3.0 for 50-59, 4.0 for 60-69, and 5.0 for men 70+. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;my 3.9 PSA would have been unremarkable in London or Stockholm. In Chicago, it triggered biopsies and anxious conversations.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This international divide reflects deeper philosophical differences. Socialistic European systems treat PSA levels as one data point in a clinical picture; capitalistic American medicine often treats it as the decision point. The result: The U.S. treats about 40% of low-risk prostate cancers, while the U.K. treats under 10%. Same disease, different medical cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial incentives cannot be ignored. A Mayo Clinic study in 2019 found that six years after diagnosis, the &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000000345" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mean costs per patient&lt;/a&gt; were $12,143 for active surveillance, $17,781 for radical prostatectomy, and $29,238 for external beam radiotherapy. When I founded support groups for men choosing surveillance almost 10 years ago, I heard fears from men with low-risk disease who felt their urologists were financially incentivized to push them into surgery. PSA gave urology a major cancer and helped upgrade its image from the specialty of syphilis and kidney stones. Now, urologists are saving lives and earning about $500,000 a year, putting them in the top 10 most lucrative specialists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that greed drives some urologists. Still, I sense that the new generation believes that surveillance is a safe choice for many low-risk patients based on the huge &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2214122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ProtecT trial&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K.&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;which showed that at 15 years, there were no significant mortality differences between men randomized between surveillance, surgery, and radiation. However, the untreated men had a higher risk of metastases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So most men with prostate cancer can live with it and not die from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial incentives and medical cultures partially explain the dramatic gap between academic and community practice. At major U.S. centers, surveillance rates now exceed 80% to 90%. But in community practice — where most men are treated — rates remain stubbornly below 50%. The U.S. system rewards intervention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The psychological burden of living with a cancer that you’re told not to treat is real. PSA anxiety becomes its own disease. MRIs, biopsies, and urology office visits can add emotional distress. We call it “SCANxiety” and “anxious surveillance.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An Italian oncologic psychologist warns these patients: “A prostatectomy doesn’t cure anxiety.” Emotional distress can be so severe that about 10% of U.S. men with low-risk prostate cancer ask for aggressive treatment, even though they are candidates for surveillance, based on a survey I presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, what I’ve learned from 15 years of observation is that stability over time is the most reliable indicator. My decade-long plateau reflects what researchers call “tumor indolence” — a biological equilibrium where low-grade cancer cells remain dormant. No one can explain how that happens, nor can they predict who will have that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;23‑year follow‑up&lt;/a&gt; to the recently published European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer showed it took a major effort in a structured PSA screening program to prevent a single prostate cancer death. The study reported that PSA screening does modestly prevent prostate cancer deaths, but only after a large amount of testing, and with clear collateral harm. In rough terms, about 450 men must be invited into repeated PSA testing to prevent one prostate cancer death. And yet, that testing means several others are overdiagnosed, leading some to live with treatment‑related side effects from cancers that might never otherwise have surfaced. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need better tools to try to screen men without rushing them into aggressive surveillance, let alone aggressive treatment. PSAs could be stratified by family history, ethnicity, and comorbidities to help men make informed decisions. New artificial intelligence-based testing, such as Artera AI, is helping men avoid overtreatment and even predicting who will fare best on active surveillance. Experts around the world are still sorting out how best to screen for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think about whether I should have undergone PSA testing because of the chaos it has caused my family and me over the past decade and a half. Would my life have been better? Could I have avoided the stress and life insurance discrimination I faced because I opted not to treat my cancer?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I were to do it over again, I probably still would have gotten PSA screening because I generally am a compliant patient. But I would have asked more questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon, I hope, we’ll have better testing that shows which prostate cancers don’t need treatment — releasing many of us from this relentless treadmill of testing, scans, and biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;

All of this is a dramatic change from the previous recommendations, which prioritized vegetables, grains and lean proteins over red meat and dairy.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While grains are now relegated to the bottom of the pyramid, our nutrition editor and registered dietitian, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/madeline-peck-11865850" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Madeline Peck, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, noted that eating fiber-rich foods is essential for our overall gut health. “Both legumes and whole grains are a valuable source of fiber, a nutrient the vast majority of Americans &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37711348/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nocaes"&gt;are not consuming enough of&lt;/a&gt;,” she explained. And now that the pyramid has de-prioritized the entire category, the fear is that consumption could drop even more. Luckily, it’s easy to incorporate this overlooked nutrient into your diet if you have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ComSaf-Airtight-Storage-Canister-Container/dp/B09KR7WXJF?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;the right containers&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ComSaf’s glass storage jars are both functional and beautiful. More than 3,900 Amazon shoppers agree, with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J3M9AOKQ5D9B?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;one commenting&lt;/a&gt; that the “glass is high quality and the bamboo lids look stylish.” The four jars in the set are 1.2 quarts each and equipped with airtight lids, meaning they’re perfect for storing nuts, seeds, oats, legumes, brown rice, quinoa and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Access to these ingredients is the first step to incorporating more fiber-rich foods into your diet. If there’s a jar filled with nuts sitting in your pantry instead of candy bars, you’ll default to the nuts. The same goes for breakfast. Fill a jar with oats, and watch how quickly you get used to eating this filling staple instead of sugary cereal. Making little changes here and there is a sure route to feeling full for longer and going to the bathroom more regularly. Such is the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magic of fiber&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the containers are also stackable, your messy pantry will look more organized.

   &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to feel safe during sex these days?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From feeling comfortable with your partner to access to public health and medication, "safety" comes up a lot in sex. But, having the tools you need to feel confident in your own sexual health is an essential part of the pursuit of pleasure.

    &lt;p&gt;Getting enough vitamin D really can help to protect you against the flu, a study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It revealed that people with a severe vitamin D deficiency were 33 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital with a respiratory tract infection than those who were receiving adequate amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/vitamin-d/"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is the only supplement recommended by the NHS for everyone during winter months, when exposure to sunlight, which the body uses to produce the nutrient, is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is already known to help regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which is vital for bone and muscle health, but experts also believe it may have antiviral properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, researchers from the Universities of Surrey, Oxford and Reading analysed data on 36,000 British adults to find out how levels of vitamin D in the body affected the rate of hospital admission with respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included a range of viral and bacterial illnesses such as flu, pneumonia and bronchitis. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/vitamin-d-could-sunshine-supplement-cut-covids-death-rate/"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of severe Covid, another respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this latest study – the largest to date – revealed that people with a severe vitamin D deficiency, classed as having a concentration below 15 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L) in the blood were 33 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory infections than those with optimal levels of more than 75nmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — When a sharp pain developed just behind Corinne Dalton’s ear last September, she feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t turn my head sideways to the right,” she said of the pain. “I could have a little clot that could travel to my brain and cause a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalton drove to the emergency department at LDS Hospital. A doctor ordered an MRI. The thing is, MRIs can cause burns if something conductive touches the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had makeup stickers on my face,” she said. “I had been playing makeup with my granddaughter who is seven years old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalton says she asked the MRI tech if she should remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘No. You should be fine.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still uneasy about those stickers, Dalton wanted to wash them off but says she wasn’t allowed off the gurney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I guess if you’re going to have a brain MRI, they don’t let you walk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the MRI room, Dalton said she again asked to remove the stickers. This time the tech agreed, but she says she was rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was about 90% done removing them, meaning 10% were still on my face, she said, ‘That’s enough Corrine. Let’s go,’” Dalton recalled the tech told her. “And I trusted her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the scan showed nothing seriously wrong with her neck, she says she came out of the procedure with a blistered and burned face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I looked in the mirror and I was horrified,” she said. “Horrified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Known but unfortunate complication”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corinne returned to LDS Hospital to speak with administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She looked at my face and said, ‘Oh my gosh, that happened?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalton says the hospital’s patient relations initially apologized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“’We’ll take care of this. it should not have happened,’” she says she was told. “’Whatever needs to be done we will do.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was referred to a cosmetic surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I can fix your face,’ the surgeon told her. “’It’ll look fine.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that work wasn’t going to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emailed me a quote. He explained in that email what had happened. He agreed that it was due to the MRI and he sent the same quote and email to the patient relations people,” Dalton told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How much?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was $7,000,” she answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dalton says when she followed up, the hospital declined to help. A letter from LDS Hospital clinical relations calls the injuries, “a known but unfortunate complication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before the MRI, I didn’t have this thin skin or bags under my eyes,” she said of her current appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

(Mark Less, KSL)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked me to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a vain person but my face changed a lot,” she said. “And I like my face, the way it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked LDS Hospital about Dalton’s case. In a statement, a spokesperson said, “The wellness and safety of our patients is our top priority,” and that the hospital works “directly with patients whenever they make us aware of a concern or negative experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital did not answer specific questions about MRI screening procedures. Intermountain Health, which operates the hospital, &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/lds-hospital/imaging" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advises patients on its website&lt;/a&gt; to remove metal objects before an MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, I found that Dalton is not alone when it comes to MRI burns. The Journal of the American Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/183664#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warn some adhesive products&lt;/a&gt; can cause burns during MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took her experience to KSL legal analyst Greg Skordas for him to weigh in on MRI burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When a person goes in for medical treatment, they have every reason to believe that the providers will do their job correctly,” Skordas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says the emergency nature of Dalton’s visit could help the hospital in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If somebody needs help right away, maybe you don’t take some of the precautions that you normally would,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if staff were warned of a potential issue and they went forward with the procedure anyhow, that could help Dalton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re on knowledge — on alert at that point,” Skordas said. “And it gives them a heightened sense of responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Dalton, she tells me she is now speaking to lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want my face fixed. I want Intermountain to take responsibility and accountability,” she said. “I want people to know so that this doesn’t happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, nowhere on the packaging of these stickers does it mention anything about metal as an ingredient. But based on Dalton’s experience there’s something in them that doesn’t jibe well with MRI machines.&lt;/p&gt;

He was riding his dirt bike — he's been riding since he was 3 years old — when he was involved in a crash with a truck half a mile from his home in Rigby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was most likely killed on impact," Janice Bell, who is Freeman's aunt, told EastIdahoNews.com. "He had a helmet and all his riding gear on, and it didn't save him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 13, just days before the accident, Freeman turned 21. Bell said her nephew's best friend, who is in his late 60s, told him he needed to get a "big boy license" since he was now 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He took Friday off to go get his new driver's license … and he thought to himself (and told his mom), 'I'm an adult now, I should be a donor.' He wasn't a donor before," Bell explained. "When he went down there (to renew his license), he became a donor. That was Friday, and he was killed Sunday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the accident, Freeman was rushed to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where his family was told he wouldn't survive. The hospital found out he was a donor, and he was taken to the intensive care unit and put on life support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A donor honor walk took place Oct. 22, where Freeman, who had been declared brain dead, was wheeled down to the operating room as family, friends, coworkers and hospital employees lined the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Freeman's decision to become a donor, he helped save the lives of seven other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His heart went to another 21-year-old boy in Utah," said Bell, who said she hopes that person goes on to "do great things." "We don't know much about his other ones (like) his kidneys and lungs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Titus Freeman in the hospital. Freeman died after a dirt bike crash in October, but was able to save seven lives through organ donation. (Photo: Freeman family)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman not only helped others as a donor, but also by giving freely and serving those around him, which he did throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman worked for Knife River in Idaho Falls at the time of his death. Bell mentioned that he led a crew of men twice his age, and he'd get to work at 5 a.m. to start everybody's machines so they'd be warm for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He gave his whole crew lunch money (and gas money) all the time," she said. "When he passed away, they all paid him back in his front loader (that) was his machine. It was full of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman, who was born in Caldwell, has one older and one younger sister. Bell said Freeman had a challenging childhood, but he rose above it. At 19, he decided to buy a house in Rigby for his mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She not only loved him — every parent has a favorite, I don't care what they say. If they say they don't, they lie — but Titus, the reason he was her favorite is he also loved her the most," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman was a gifted baseball player who enjoyed playing disc golf and going fishing. When he was 12, he rebuilt a snowmobile, and most recently, he was rebuilding the engine in his truck. He got his truck running the day of his accident, but he never got a chance to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was such a good boy. Never in trouble in his life," Bell recalled. "He didn't go out drinking. He was in bed by 8 or 9. We call him the old man of the family. He was an anomaly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said losing her nephew was "the worst thing possible," but she is proud of the lives he was able to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to be religious, or you can be, but God — if there is a God — he did this. This must have been part of his plan … of some plan," she said. "I guess he had a plan for my beautiful, sweet nephew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman will be honored in Utah this summer when his name is added to the Celebration of Life Monument. The monument is a memorial and tribute to people both living and deceased who have donated organs, tissue, and eyes for either transplant or research in the Intermountain area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Most men don’t notice anything at first because early prostate cancer often doesn’t cause obvious symptoms. It quietly grows, sometimes for years, before it becomes big enough to bother you. And that’s part of the reason it can sneak up on people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer ranks as the third leading cancer site among males in India, following lung cancer and mouth cancer. Globally, about 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed every year, and those numbers are expected to rise as populations age. A 2024 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/indianjurol/fulltext/2024/07000/descriptive_epidemiology_of_prostate_cancer_in.7.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that “Prostate cancer incidence showed a rise after the age of 50, with a notable acceleration after age 64. The overall annual percentage change for prostate cancer incidence from 1982 to 2016 was 2.6. Around 43.0% of all prostate cancers were diagnosed at the distant metastatic stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d think that when something is becoming more common, people would talk about it more. But that isn’t really the case with prostate cancer in India. Even though prostate cancer is one of the cancers men get most often, a lot of guys either haven’t heard of it or don’t take it seriously until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big reason is that early signs don’t scream “something’s wrong.” Frequent peeing at night or a weak stream, most men just shrug it off as “just aging” or chalk it up to an enlarged prostate (which lots of older men get). The subtlety of symptoms means many folks don’t even think, maybe I should check this out with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the whole talk-about-it problem. In many Indian families, men aren’t used to chatting about urinary issues or anything that feels “private.” Shame or embarrassment kicks in, doctors don’t get a call, and the awareness just stays low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232704210_Awareness_Regarding_Risk_Factors_Symptoms_and_Treatment_Facilities_for_Cancer_in_Selected_States_of_India" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also show that general knowledge about cancers not linked to tobacco, prostate for instance, is very low in many parts of India. Most people might have heard the name but can’t really say what it is, what the risk factors are, or why early detection matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prostate cancer: Common symptoms that get missed easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms at first.

These include a weak urinary stream, not emptying your bladder (urinary retention) and waking up more than 2 times per night to urinate (nocturia). The symptoms of BPH typically progress slowly over time. Prostate Cancer may present in similar ways during early stages but is typically detected by the following signs: blood in urine/sperm, persistent bone or back pain, sudden/unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and rapidly increasing symptoms rather than slow progression over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I wake up several times at night to urinate—how do I know if it’s just age or something serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for men to experience nocturia while they age, and waking up one to two times is considered normal, especially if it is an occasional occurrence. However, increased concern arises if the pattern becomes frequent enough (more than two to three times each night), appears suddenly or increases in severity and if any additional symptom accompanies it, weak urine stream, urinary retention, or blood in urine. Therefore, if the issues of nocturia and/or waking frequently at night are noticed, they should be evaluated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should I see a doctor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a person sees blood in their urine, semen, experiences unexplained weight loss or fatigue, they should contact their physician. Symptoms such as blood, new or increasing urinary symptoms, weak or interrupted stream of urine, or continuing pain in lower back, hips, and/or pelvis are an indication for consulting their physician. Additionally, symptoms disrupting sleep or work would also warrant a visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should men over 40 get checked for prostate issues, even if they feel fine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most physicians will begin routine screening for prostate cancer based on family history when the man reaches 50 years old, while those with a family history of prostate cancer may begin screening at an earlier age, between 40 and 45 years of age. A standard screening for prostate cancer consists of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and a digital rectal examination (DRE). Depending on what the initial PSA test results indicate and how risk factors (family history, ethnicity, etc.) for the individual, the possible frequency of screenings are from once a year to every 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If I have a family history of prostate cancer, how can I tell if minor symptoms are a warning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family history has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, so even mild changes in urinary function should be evaluated by a doctor. During the evaluation, even though the initial thought may be that such changes are due to normal aging or BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia) it is important not to discount them as such. The earlier a person discusses any concerns with their doctor, has a PSA test performed, and follows up regularly, the greater the likelihood that prostate cancer will be detected early enough to allow for successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer doesn’t always announce itself loudly. When symptoms look like “normal aging,” it’s easy to ignore them. Doctors stress that paying attention to changes, and talking about them early, can make the difference between a cancer that’s treatable and one that’s already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>空气污染与更高的ALS风险和更快的下降有关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-linked-to-higher-als-risk-and-faster-decline</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The scientist  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stephen-hawking" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73078" data-postid="189658" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; lived with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common type of motor neurone disease, for 55 years. He was one of the longest-surviving people with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most people with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/motor-neuron-disease-7326"&gt;motor neurone disease&lt;/a&gt; are not as lucky. It often progresses quickly, and many pass away within &lt;a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/about-mnd/mnd-explained/what-is-mnd?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=11242803743&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD2ZVeha5qE2pvcFKA94eGzQYzvCt&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA7LzLBhAgEiwAjMWzCEZ9qe2VjISZU9maKjCbE2cjB-M3CsZpUuVKDSoeh5I6G9sjRDQFABoCsZ4QAvD_BwE"&gt;two to five years&lt;/a&gt; of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still no cure. Genetics account for only about &lt;a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/about-mnd/mnd-explained/inherited-mnd"&gt;10% of cases&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the causes are still largely a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-major-pollutant-in-fossil-fuels-has-been-linked-with-als"&gt;One Major Pollutant in Fossil Fuels Has Been Linked With ALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.5379"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt; showed one possible contributor: air pollution, both for the risk of developing motor neurone disease and for how it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, my colleagues and I examined air pollution levels at each of the 10,000 participants' home addresses for up to ten years before diagnosis. We focused on two common types of outdoor pollutants that are widely linked to health harms: nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter is made up of tiny airborne particles (far thinner than a human hair). It is usually grouped by size: PM2.5 (less than or equal to 2.5 micrometres), PM10 (less than or equal to 10 micrometres), and the in-between fraction PM2.5-10 (between 2.5 and 10 micrometres).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that being exposed to air pollution over the long term, even at the fairly low levels typically seen in Sweden, was linked to a 20–30% higher chance of developing motor neurone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the pattern still held up when we compared siblings, which helps rule out a lot of shared factors like genetics and growing up in the same environment.&lt;br&gt;

Taken together, the results suggest that pollution generated close to home, especially from local vehicle emissions, may have a stronger effect than particulate matter carried in from farther away, which tends to account for much of the broader day-to-day variation in particulate matter levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors regularly keep tabs on how well patients are managing everyday functions across a few key areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include bulbar function (speech, saliva control, and swallowing), fine motor function (handwriting, cutting food, dressing, and personal hygiene), gross motor function (turning in bed and adjusting bedding, walking, and climbing stairs), and breathing (shortness of breath, difficulty breathing when lying flat, and signs of respiratory failure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in our study were assessed about every six months after diagnosis. We then looked at how quickly the disease was getting worse overall and within each of these domains. Patients whose decline was faster than that of 75% of other patients were labelled as having faster progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with higher odds of having faster progression overall, particularly affecting motor and respiratory function, but not bulbar function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189683" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/PersonHoldingMaskToFaceWithTrafficInBackground-642x361.jpg" alt="Young person wearing a mask in a high traffic area" class="size-medium wp-image-189683" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/PersonHoldingMaskToFaceWithTrafficInBackground-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/PersonHoldingMaskToFaceWithTrafficInBackground-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/PersonHoldingMaskToFaceWithTrafficInBackground-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/PersonHoldingMaskToFaceWithTrafficInBackground.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189683" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PM10 and nitrogen dioxide pollutants are typically produced by nearby road traffic. (Microgen/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for these differences are not yet clear. One possibility is that different parts of the nervous system vary in their vulnerability to pollution-related injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also be because air pollution has consistently been linked to chronic lung diseases, reduced lung function, and infections, all of which have been associated with poorer outcomes in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-psychiatric-medications-may-increase-risk-of-als"&gt;Common Psychiatric Medications May Increase Risk of ALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accounted for many factors that could influence both air pollution exposure and motor neurone disease risk, including personal and neighbourhood income, education, occupation, and whether participants lived in urban or rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study did not have data on smoking habits or indoor air pollution exposure. However, there is no evidence suggesting that people with and without motor neurone disease differ significantly in these factors in ways that would explain our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results bring us closer to understanding motor neurone disease and may eventually help with earlier diagnosis and better treatment. But there's a wider message here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're all exposed to air pollution, and the evidence keeps mounting that it harms our health in serious ways. Cleaning up our air could do far more good than we realise.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272457/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
