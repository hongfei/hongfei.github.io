That adds up to over 30 million people and the figure is only expected to rise after a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-15437117/fat-jabs-weight-loss-drug-Wegovy-pill-UK.html"&gt;pill version of Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; secured &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-2a14af10-ef0c-11f0-95c5-2fd97e7ade78"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approval, adding a needle-free option to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have praised the drugs for helping people shed pounds with little more than a weekly injection. And studies show that patients who lose weight slash their risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and dementia, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid the frenzy, some experts are issuing warns over a possible future epidemic, linked to GLP-1 drugs that threatens to save years off otherwise healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Estes, an emergency medicine physician in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-566ce3a0-ebda-11f0-953f-db762ab9609b" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, told Daily Mail: 'One hundred percent of clients on weight loss drugs see at least some muscle loss. I don’t think anyone who is on actual weight loss doses will see zero percent muscle loss.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Douglas Ewing, a bariatric surgeon in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-2a172010-ef0c-11f0-95c5-2fd97e7ade78"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, added to Daily Mail: 'Less than five or 10 percent of patients complain about muscle loss, but it is something that probably more people than that would notice if you dug deeper. Muscle wasting is rarely symptomatic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are warning over a silent epidemic that could be caused by weight loss drugs. The above is a stock image of Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Estes pointed to analyses of eight large US and European studies, which suggest that, on average, 25 to 35 percent of the weight lost on the drugs is muscle, bone or other lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; has warned that the figure could be even higher, with some studies estimating that 40 to 60 percent of total weight loss is lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle is essential for movement, stability and overall health. Losing a significant amount raises the risk of falls and, with them, potentially debilitating injuries, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the average Ozempic user being 50 to 64 years old, according to the same KFF poll, experts fear the drugs could accelerate the muscle loss already experienced around that age and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11673557/Miracle-weight-loss-drug-trending-TikTok-cause-facial-aging.html"&gt;raise the risk of sarcopenia, progressive decline in muscle mass due to aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That increases the risk of falls that lead to head injuries, broken bones and other complications that can reduce lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But muscle loss could also affect younger adults in their 30s and 40s, experts say, if they suffer from falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Will Haas, a weight loss doctor in North Carolina, warned&lt;span&gt; 'I do believe that could be the potential if the trend isn't turned around and the right education and support are not in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If the nation sees people losing weight during their 30s and 40s, and also losing muscle mass, that trend could follow them well into other decades of life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alexandra Collett, 31, from the UK, lost 136lbs on Ozempic, but afterward found herself spending thousands removing loose skin and having a breast reduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that unintentional falls are already the leading cause of injury-related death among adults over the age of 65 years, with more than 41,000 dying from them every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death rate from falls among adults aged 65 years and older is also rising. The CDC said the rate increased 70 percent from 2003 to 2023 among adults aged 65 to 74 years, and more than 75 percent for those aged 75 to 84 years. Among the over-85s, it has more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear why this is happening, but experts have suggested it is down to the use opioids and antidepressants in older adults, which can cause dizziness and leave these adults at greater risk of losing their balance. Weight loss drugs may only add to this trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs are urged to eat a high-protein diet and do strength training at least twice a week to help prevent muscle loss while on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors report trouble getting patients to follow these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what proportion of patients on weight loss drugs may not be following diet or exercise recommendations, but in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC546419/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;comparable paper from 2004&lt;/a&gt;, where scientists tracked 4,000 obese adults taking prescription weight loss drugs, researchers found only 27 percent reported eating fewer calories and following the physical activity recommendations from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing added: 'Compliance, overall, is a difficult problem when you are dealing with diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have continual follow-up in the clinic, if you don't have the educational resources, if you don't have objective criteria, then you are less likely to be able to coax your patients slowly into better habits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Douglas Ewing, who raised concerns about the future because of weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that about 60 to 75 percent of patients at his clinic comply, but that when this does not happen, they provide patients with extra resources to encourage them to follow the diet and exercise recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All weight loss plans lead to at least some muscle loss, doctors say, but add that normally this is only around 15 to 20 percent of total weight lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Haas said that, for now, the benefits of weight loss drugs for obese individuals, when used with diet and exercise, outweigh the risks in his view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'For many patients, the rewards of true weight loss can absolutely outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes can include positive effects on blood sugar levels, blood pressure, sleep apnea, joint pain and quality-of-life changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it is not just a function to promote weight loss but to promote good health. This is best achieved through weight loss coupled with preservation of muscle mass, nutritional support, and lifestyle changes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other doctors disagreed that muscle wasting posed a major risk for users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Lofton, an obesity medicine expert in New York, told Daily Mail: 'There are scientific articles which have demonstrated that there is no excessive muscle wasting in patients taking GLP-1s versus those losing weight without meds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are expecting more people to start using weight loss drugs in the future (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important that the prescriber of GLP1s also provide the support for lifestyle management or refer to someone else skilled in such.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also warned that weight loss drugs may raise the risk of gallstones, or hard deposits, like tiny pebbles, that form from digestive fluid in the gallbladder, a gland near the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted the drugs may raise the risk of these complications because the rapid weight loss they cause can alter bile composition and reduce gallbladder emptying, causing bile to stagnate in the gland and become stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stones are painful, but can be removed with surgery. Patients generally do not suffer long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing told Daily Mail: 'I tell my patients gallstones and gallbladder problems are one thing they should keep in mind. Any time you lose weight, you risk developing these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We do see a lot of patients with gallbladder problems already. I can't really say whether we are seeing an uptick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:10:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRFhzaWMtYmQzd254N015dUNQSjN3bjlPQm9nQVY0UWs4WFZRZ3htOXRkcWczT2lyU0sxaUJRLV9lZF9sQjZhcEVlN2tJSTc2QjJMVnlSSDhVc1l4dGJPSU5mZjk2eUJheFU3aHNHeHdnVFhvMnMzOUlxUjI1bGJMX2ZMcjJzcnB3eWpqV29HUmxUUmxLczhtNzQxcw</guid></item><item><title>我妻子刚刚又生了一个孩子。我想我再也不想做爱了。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2026/01/sex-kids-dad-father-wife-libido-advice.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbt001x3b7awcb9j4lu@published"&gt;My wife and I recently had our second child (and last, we agreed). I am experiencing a totally new feeling: sexual emptiness. I feel like since the reproductive act has been completed, there is very little left to be interested in sexually. We’ve always had an intense but intermittent sex life, with me being the one taking initiative and pushing boundaries and my wife being scarcely available and allowing some of my fantasies to become true. It took a decade for my sexual enthusiasm to slowly fade, however sex always felt fun at least up until now. The new baby is here and I feel like it’s pointless to pursue and engage in sexual activities. I haven’t lost fantasies and desires but it’s all feeling very muffled. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to move past this moment and find a new approach to sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbt00203b7a5no83dqc@published"&gt;It is definitely common for parenthood to derail sex for at least a period of time. If you watched your wife give birth, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/postpartum-sex-advice-childbirth-husband-pregnancy.html"&gt;that could have something to do with your apathy&lt;/a&gt;, as depressing as that is. Also, the burdens of raising an infant can sap people of their will to do … well, just about everything. This may be an issue that you just need to give some time to in order to see improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="194" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00213b7a06j533ts@published"&gt;Beyond that, I think your current task is to attempt to untangle potential personal issues from relationship issues. Some guys’ libidos start to lag in their 40s (or even earlier). Sometimes this seems to be related to hormonal happenings (like decreased testosterone, which could be directly linked to fatherhood, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3182719/"&gt;according to some data&lt;/a&gt;). If I were you, I’d definitely get tests performed to see if there is anything happening on a biological level. You also express a level of grievance regarding your wife and her participation in your sex life. Is there stuff there to work through in counseling/sex therapy? Perhaps it would be helpful to get to the root of what’s happening, whether it’s related to the recent birth of your second child, something physiological, or a cooling off in your sexual relationship with your wife, which is typical of long-term relationships and may require some strategic distancing like that which Esther Perel recommends in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HB4HS1MOVRQP&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9TBgqJH8OXaXJ6KF-p0h2kiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqbntE_NQgtEeQ4z5Xh21yUfQMPho632oSNe9pk1FPgu8WwScI9LBbYConGrWU8sEJYCMm2JrfgmBFsP5NS6e9SxLQ43n-vgDAGtdzv58yXRWR7IYdMjsPx80ZTgKQF3ySydOH1oGpx9R7539r4sTK25qve4cilQVrQnN6griGllIP2KAfBlAYLZz-iJu-5CXXlY.buXEIn7oOzyuCyhuje0NowcjiXYnF1-wD6jG6v5he9w&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1767828185&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+c,aps,382&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it is some or all of these factors in concert. Each one will require different approaches, which is why someone working directly with you and your wife would be especially useful in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00233b7a5rc2g84j@published"&gt;I’ve found myself in love with a new man. Words do not describe how much better this world is with him in it. We are both highly sexual beings and our chemistry is what I’ve dreamed of. What’s interesting though, is that he has a more average-sized dick than what I’m used to (which I’m honestly obsessed with since we can have sex for hours—my previous partners were bigger and it would hurt after too long).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00243b7a8ij3x2f0@published"&gt;That said, I can’t seem to orgasm, either from penetrative sex or from deep clitoral grinding (both of which are tried and true for me). I am deeply at a loss. Is it because of his size? Something else I’m not clocking? We can go for so long and I’m used to having multiple orgasms in short sessions. He is talented with mouth and fingers, so that’s nice but … I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="165" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00273b7abios9eft@published"&gt;There is certainly a possibility that he’s just not hitting your spot the way bigger dicks from your past have. It’s encouraging, though, that you are “honestly obsessed” with his dick and want to have sex with him for hours despite the lack of penetrative orgasms. Maybe you take a note from Bottled Up below and learn to appreciate the journey over the destination. From what it sounds like, you’re well on your way. You say your new guy is talented with his mouth and fingers—does that mean you are orgasming from oral/manual sex? It is not at all uncommon for people to be able to come from one form of sex and not another. I understand your puzzlement over an apparent change potentially related to his dick size, but look: Find orgasms where you can. If he’s getting you off in some ways and you appreciate all the ways that you sexually engage with him, well, it sounds like you have a near-perfect situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbv00283b7alen8k69q@published"&gt;One thing you might try introducing is toys. Perhaps a vibrator would provide more clitoral stimulation during sex that could push you over the edge. A dildo of a size that you’re more accustomed to could theoretically give you the vaginal orgasms you crave. Introducing toys can be a dicey prospect for some partners, who may feel like they are being judged as lacking as a result, but if he’s generally game and his ego is sturdy, you can suggest this merely as a way to spice things up. If you have reliable ways to orgasm when you masturbate, you may want to consider introducing them as well. If you feel free enough to do so in bed without much conversation, that bodes well for your overall connection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkn002f3b7adjaiv5yl@published"&gt;I’m a middle-aged cis man, recently divorced and dating again. A familiar problem has returned: I take &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt; to get off. With my ex, we were able to get to a place where I could reliably orgasm during a healthy session (40 to 60 minutes) because we had figured out what worked and I felt comfortable. With new partners, it’s just not happening. I’m mostly fine with maintaining an erection but can’t get myself over the orgasmic hump. I remember this from my 20s and think it has something to do with a mix of anxiety and physical insensitivity. It’s not a huge deal for me, since I’ve learned to enjoy the journey and not just the destination, but it seems deflating to my partner. It’s worth noting that I’ve abused porn in the past and have basically sworn off both porn and masturbation these days. Any thoughts on ways to bring myself to a quicker orgasm, especially during PIV sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzko002i3b7aap5c97zx@published"&gt;This is tough! Delayed orgasm (DO)—the condition that you seem to be experiencing—is not easily treated. Appreciating the journey and not the   destination would be my primary piece of advice and you’re already there. Perhaps it might be useful to have a discussion with partners assuring them that you actually enjoy your marathons and aren’t nearly as concerned with your orgasm as they are. It’s great to be considerate and care about what your partner cares about, but you might invest a little bit less in what amounts to an irrational concern.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002j3b7at5pee2x5@published"&gt;Another bit of advice usually given here is to reduce porn use/masturbation, but you’re already doing that as well. I showed your letter to my go-to urology source, Charles Welliver, director of men’s health in the department of urology at Albany Medical College, who replied via email that he felt that he’d figured out the issue until the end of your letter, when you mentioned your masturbation/porn abstinence. Foiled again!&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002k3b7aiv3qhrrp@published"&gt;Welliver said that he’d inquire as to whether or not you are on SSRIs, which can cause delayed orgasm, and he’d also potentially prescribe cabergoline, a medicine that works on the brain’s dopamine receptors and is typically prescribed to treat high prolactin levels. It can sometimes speed things up. (In Welliver’s experience, it has around a 50 percent success rate.) He has heard of others using oxytocin intranasal spray, but like the rest of the off-label medicines sometimes used to treat delayed orgasm (bupropion and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine [Adderall], among them), the data is scant. What you’re experiencing isn’t necessarily in need of a medical solution, though—especially considering that, as you said, this isn’t really a problem for you. I’m just letting you know what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002l3b7aksu26owp@published"&gt;You could also take this as an opportunity to explore. Sometimes new stimulation or scenarios can change orgasm time. If there’s anything you find hot but haven’t yet experienced, now’s the time. Prostate stimulation, in particular, can reliably speed up orgasm for some guys, and that can be achieved as easily as wearing a prostate massager (like the kind &lt;a href="https://www.aneros.com/"&gt;Aneros&lt;/a&gt; makes) during sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002m3b7akaab7er3@published"&gt;You can read a more detailed breakdown on the research on DO &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/01/delayed-ejaculation-orgasm-anorgasmia-men-ssri-testosterone-advice.html"&gt;in this past column&lt;/a&gt;. Some other potential paths to consider are getting your thyroid levels checked (hypothyroid patients often experience DO) as well as sex therapy (which may or may not involve penile vibratory stimulation, which has a bit of &lt;a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382163/"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing improvement in anorgasmic men). Delayed orgasm may be difficult to address, but it’s not impossible, so have hope and don’t let your concerns get in the way of the good time you’re already having.&lt;/p&gt;

All of my serious relationships have been long-distance and I am new to the in-person dating and hookup scene. I’ve been having a lot of success and fun, but I still have one problem: I don’t like kissing mouth-to-mouth. Mouth on the body is fine. It just grosses me out and turns me off. People seem really bothered and insulted by this, but I don’t care—I don’t like it, and I don’t want to do it. How can I convince my partners that that’s really all there is to it? &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/kissing-norms-insults-sex-advice.html"&gt;Why is it so hard to opt-out of this particular act?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“How did you sleep?” You might answer that question by weighing how many hours you slept or how often you woke up throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a third, often neglected, element of sleep to consider, experts say. It’s the consistency of your sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep consistency refers to how well you maintain the same bedtime and wake-up time, give or take 30 minutes — and that includes weekends, said Jean-Philippe Chaput, a professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that most adults in the United States do not have a consistent sleep schedule. And that may be harming their health, Chaput said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the research indicates &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the science on the link between inconsistent sleep and poor health is based on observational studies, which can’t prove cause and effect. Their results are also often restricted by various limitations (including if the study was performed on a small number of people, or on people of only certain ages, ethnicities or occupations). It’s also difficult to accurately track people’s sleep patterns over months or years, and some studies define sleep consistency in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, scientists have found some patterns. Those who tend to deviate most from a consistent sleep schedule seem to be at higher risk of certain health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 2,000 adults aged 45 to 84 in the United States. They concluded that those with the most irregular sleep schedules were more than twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those with more regular sleep patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study published in 2024, researchers analyzed sleep data from more than 88,000 adults in the United Kingdom and assigned “sleep regularity” scores to all of them. Those who scored lowest, meaning they had the most irregular sleep schedules, were about 50% more likely to develop dementia than those who scored in the middle of the range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t sure how frequent or how severe your sleep irregularity has to be to increase your health risk, said Soomi Lee, an associate professor of sleep and aging at Penn State. But the more you deviate from your typical sleep time — whether that’s within a 24-hour period or across weeks or months — the more the risks seem to increase, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large review of studies published in 2023, a group of sleep scientists concluded that there was enough evidence to recommend maintaining a regular sleep schedule to help protect metabolic, mental and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why inconsistent sleep may put health at risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still untangling why inconsistent sleep patterns might negatively affect health, but their leading theory has to do with the body’s circadian rhythm, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your circadian rhythm makes up a roughly 24-hour internal clock that governs your sleep-wake cycle as well as the ebbs and flows of your hormones, metabolism, cardiovascular function, immune system, appetite and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stray from your typical sleep schedule, the bodily functions that rely on those rhythms are thrown off, too. For example, staying up late or sleeping in may affect your hormone levels. Cortisol, which regulates stress, could be released at odd times or in more erratic ways. This can increase stress and inflammation throughout the body that, over time, may affect cardiovascular or metabolic health, Chaput said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A misaligned circadian rhythm may also cause you to feel hungry outside of your regular mealtimes, said Dr. Andrew Varga, an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. That could lead you to eat at unusual hours, such as late at night, possibly resulting in digestive issues or, in the long run, weight gain or obesity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to keep sleep consistent &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With work, school, parenting demands and social obligations, it can be challenging to sleep consistently. But experts have some tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting an alarm to go off an hour before your bedtime every night can remind you that it’s time to start getting ready for sleep, Varga said. Doing something relaxing during that hour, such as reading or meditating, can help you wind down for bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to expose yourself to sunlight every morning — ideally for 20 to 30 minutes at the same time every day, said Dr. Nishay Chitkara, director of sleep medicine at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue. While standing in front of a window can be beneficial, he said, it’s best to go outside to do this, even if it’s cloudy. A bright artificial indoor light, like a light therapy box, can help, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light is the main cue that regulates your circadian rhythm. When it hits your eyes in the morning, your body begins its countdown to later that evening — when it releases hormones telling your body it’s time to go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not feel exhausted from inconsistent sleep in the same way you might after a night of tossing and turning, Lee added. But try your best to stick with a sleep routine regardless. The more consistent you are, she said, the better your health will be in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Trump administration announcement was led by prominent vaccine critic and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/07/us-vaccine-schedule-guidelines-change" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK, Australia, and Denmark&lt;/a&gt; only recommend the RSV shot for high-risk newborns because those countries all recommend the vaccine during pregnancy. Additionally, those countries have universal healthcare – which the US does not – which means everyone is able to visit the doctor regularly and receive the vaccines. In the US, where care is much more fragmented, only about a third of pregnant people receive the shot, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Infections and hospitalizations from the virus, which is particularly dangerous for young children, are beginning to ramp up in the US this respiratory season. But in recent years, doctors and parents have seen a major decrease in severe illness among babies who received the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s easy to see in real life. We can really tell that hospitalizations are down,” said Richard Rupp, professor in pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and the interim director of the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, who as a researcher was involved with the trials of RSV shots for newborns. “It’s made a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four studies in Jama confirm these observations, echoing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/rsv-cases-decline-vaccines-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous data&lt;/a&gt; showing a significant decline in hospitalization because of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This time of year, hospitals used be full of babies struggling to breathe because of RSV; sometimes, they would run out of beds for all of them. Doctors like Rupp are now worried restricting the shots will make RSV hospitalizations surge once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vast majority (81%) of babies hospitalized with RSV have no underlying conditions. Giving the shot only to children with existing health issues will “miss a large majority of the potential cases”, says Kevin Ault, an obstetrician-gynecologist and a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/vaccines-rfk-jr-cdc-acip-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now-defunct&lt;/a&gt; RSV working group at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s very concerning, and that’s why a universal recommendation was made,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rupp called RSV “a horrible disease” and described how it can manifest in a patient: “At first, it might seem like a child has a little cold, but then things can change – and quickly. In an hour or two, it can turn the other way,” with the child “fighting for every breath … The fear is always that they’ll just stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;RSV vaccination during pregnancy is 70% effective at preventing hospitalization, and the shot given to newborns to prevent RSV was even better, at 81% effective, one study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2843213?resultClick=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. The newborn shot is more effective at preventing child hospitalization compared to the pregnancy shot, though both worked well, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2843212" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a second study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, the RSV shot for infants appears to prevent hospitalization from all lower-respiratory infections, a third study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2842555" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. That’s likely because RSV can cause lingering effects, such as bacterial infections. And the vaccines are safe to give during pregnancy, a fourth study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2843668?guestAccessKey=c3bd4ace-ce5c-4fcc-9396-5ccc68c7a6ba&amp;amp;utm_source=fbpage&amp;amp;utm_medium=social_jama&amp;amp;utm_term=19181941763&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert&amp;amp;linkId=896361963&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawPM8vpleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFBcU5VcXBjeDNRQ3dyTkJqc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHgy9_vpdB65oedK5MizeO2yRwvTX_Qovh0H0p4r4grK2pXuzDEdSISyAsK4w_aem_j-fF0moK6PnSzGo1lE3Uiw" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. In the clinical trials, there was a statistically insignificant possibility of preterm birth, but this follow-up study found no such relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prior to the shots, which were approved in 2023, 2 to 3% of babies in the US were hospitalized with RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s the most common reason for children under five to be hospitalized,” said Ault. RSV has also been linked with developing asthma, a lifelong condition that can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shots given to infants aren’t typical vaccines; they are monoclonal antibodies, or lab-made antibodies that help the babies fight off the virus for several months, until the protection fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts were surprised when the Trump administration began targeting the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was caught, I’ve got to say, flat-footed on the whole RSV thing,” Rupp said. “I was surprised, because this sort of seems like an attack on monoclonal antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With Covid, even people who were opposed to vaccination have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/21/monoclonal-antibodies-covid-treatment-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eager&lt;/a&gt; to get the monoclonal antibody treatments, Rupp pointed out. Earlier versions of monoclonal antibodies to fight RSV have been given to children for decades without any safety signals emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I could not even imagine that we would be at this spot with anybody even doubting that it was something that should be available for all the kids,” Rupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ault said the decision was “made by political appointees without a scientific basis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tracy Beth Høeg, who was recently named the top drugs regulator at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claimed recently&lt;/a&gt; that babies in the clinical trials had a higher death rate – but she also noted that it was not statistically significant. Even so, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the safety of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were three &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinault.bsky.social/post/3lrl5j52i5k2c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the trials, Ault said, “but they were months and months and months after the vaccine, and they were due to things like dehydration”. The shots have since rolled out to millions of infants with no known safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The limitations on shots will further erode access to them – even for babies who are deemed high risk, Ault said, adding: “If you start having [more] fragmentation of the system, you’re going to see hospitals and offices not stocking it. So even if it’s covered on paper, it might not be available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This decision means hospitals, pediatricians, and state and local governments are now scrambling, during RSV season, to figure out best practices, Ault said, which will likely result in confusion about who should stock and administer the shots. A pediatrician might assume a baby got the shot at the hospital, while hospitalists might believe the parents need to talk to their pediatrician first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s a quick breakdown in coordination and coverage that way,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than half of children in the US receive their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program. While officials have said the restricted shots will still be available through Medicaid and other federal programs, experts worry that could change with the stroke of a pen from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody’s big concern is whether or not it will be covered by insurance and by the Vaccines for Children program,” Rupp said. “Those are the people who really will not be able to afford to have this for their children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s also another complication – though it could work in patients’ favor. It’s not clear exactly which children are now recommended to get the RSV shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s no defined ‘high risk’,” Ault said. Because of the high hospitalization rate for babies with no preexisting conditions, simply being an infant should make them eligible for the shot, Rupp and Ault both said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All babies in the first few months of life are at high risk for RSV,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQNG4xeE9nRFgtZzVCclZMNUdjWVlvMVNZMEtqQ1NEQlpwaXZ4NnphXzB5SGpBbVI1M1Z5RVEyeThnUzlOTlVCdkIycWszYnpKRFJqRnY3bXVkNV8ydFpRakhybkF5azdTUzdVeWRyWGRKdnJ6SnhrNVItcEtnZzQ</guid></item><item><title>您的心脏不在乎您有多年轻：心脏病专家恳求您放弃的神话-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/health/your-heart-doesnt-care-how-young-you-are-the-myths-cardiologists-beg-you-to-drop/articleshow/126462036.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease still carries this strange reputation. Something that happens later. To someone else. To people who didn’t take care of themselves. And yet, cardiologists are seeing younger patients walk into clinics every week with symptoms they ignored because they believed the wrong things for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the deal: your heart doesn’t care how young you are, how busy life is, or how many times you’ve told yourself you’ll “deal with it later.” Heart disease is quietly the world’s number one killer, and it’s not just something that happens to “other people.” Every year, nearly 20 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-%28cvds%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organisation report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), which include heart attacks and strokes, and that’s nearly one-third of all deaths around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes heart disease so sneaky is how it shows up, or doesn’t show up. Lots of damage happens long before anyone feels anything. High blood pressure creeps up quietly. Levels of blood sugar, lipids, and inflammation rise without obvious discomfort. The early signs can be stuff you shrug off: fatigue, breathlessness, weird aches, an off day that just won’t quit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s another part of the puzzle: people often don’t get checked until it’s almost too late. As per a survey by Wockhardt Hospitals, doctors say only about 35 per cent of people go for preventive heart check-ups, the rest show up only after symptoms appear. That means conditions that could have been caught early go undetected until there’s a crisis. Add to that the heartbreaking statistic, as per a 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10442961/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;that only 11 per cent of heart attack patients reach hospitals in what doctors call the “golden hour,” the first hour when treatment makes the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are we up against? Unhealthy diets, cigarettes, stress, inactivity, pollution, these risk factors are everywhere. They stack up over years, quietly making arteries stiffer, blood pressure higher, and the heart’s job heavier. And the worst part? Half the people who die of heart disease never saw it coming. Many young adults think they’re “too young” for a heart problem. They’re not. Rates of heart attacks in people under 40 have risen sharply in recent years, with stress and modern lifestyles being big contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when cardiologists say “forget these myths,” they’re not being dramatic. They’re fighting an epidemic that doesn’t shout, doesn’t wait, and definitely doesn’t care how young you are. Your heart works every second of your life, wouldn’t it make sense to learn how to listen back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bipin Kumar Dubey, HOD, Cardiology and Principal Director, Interventional Cardiology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka, these myths aren’t harmless. Dr. Ranjan Modi, Senior Consultant, Interventional Cardiology at Medanta Hospital, Noida, tells TOI Health many patients don’t miss the signs because they don’t care. They miss them because they believe the wrong stories about how heart disease works. They delay treatment. And sometimes, they cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors have debunked a few common myths around heart disease that stops people from taking medical advice and hence delays treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I’m too young for heart trouble”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most dangerous belief of all. Yes, heart disease becomes more common with age. But today’s lifestyle has changed the timeline. Long work hours, constant stress, smoking, poor sleep, little movement, and processed food have pushed heart risk into the 30s and even 20s. Dr Dubey often sees younger adults shocked by a diagnosis they never thought applied to them. And that shock usually comes after warning signs were brushed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“If it was serious, I’d feel chest pain”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies have done real damage here. Not every heart problem shows up as crushing chest pain. Some people feel breathless for no clear reason. Others feel unusually tired, dizzy, nauseous, or have pain in the jaw, back, or arm. Women, especially, tend to have quieter symptoms. But quiet doesn’t mean harmless. And waiting for dramatic pain can mean waiting too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I’m thin, I exercise sometimes, I should be fine”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being slim doesn’t give your heart a free pass. Cholesterol levels, blood sugar, smoking, stress, and family history matter just as much, sometimes more. Dr Dubey points out that many patients look “healthy” on the outside but have serious issues inside. The heart doesn’t care about appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Exercise is risky once you have heart issues”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth keeps people stuck in fear. While random, intense workouts can be harmful, guided and moderate exercise is often part of recovery. Movement strengthens the heart. Avoiding it completely can actually make things worse. The key is doing it with medical advice, not guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“It’s genetic, so why bother”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes matter, but they’re not the whole story. Lifestyle choices still carry huge weight. Regular check-ups, better food, movement, and stress control can slow or even prevent problems, even if heart disease runs in the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Women don’t need to worry as much”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in women, and symptoms are often missed or misread. That’s why awareness and routine screening matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Treatment means I’m cured”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A procedure or pill isn’t the finish line. It’s the beginning of long-term care. Follow-ups, medication, and lifestyle changes keep the heart stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if there’s one thing Dr Dubey stresses, it’s this: don’t argue with symptoms. Listen to your body. Act early. The heart rarely gives a second warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“My cholesterol is normal, so I’m safe”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol gets all the attention, but heart disease doesn’t work on a single number. Blood pressure, blood sugar, smoking, weight, stress levels, lack of movement, and family history all play a role. Dr. Modi often reminds patients that heart risk is about the full picture. Normal cholesterol is good news, but it’s not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Once I start heart medicines, I’m stuck forever”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not always. Some medications are protective and may be adjusted or reduced if lifestyle changes and medical control improve over time. But stopping medicines on your own is risky. Dr. Modi stresses that changes should always happen under medical guidance. Sudden stops can trigger serious events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“If I don’t feel anything, nothing’s wrong”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most dangerous heart conditions stay silent. High blood pressure, diabetes, and even coronary artery disease can develop without obvious symptoms. Many people only discover them after a heart attack or stroke. Regular checkups catch what feelings can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I exercise, so my diet doesn’t matter much”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise helps. But it doesn’t cancel out poor food choices. Processed foods, excess sugar, and too much salt still strain the heart, even in active people. Heart health is built on daily habits, not just workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the truth is simple. The heart rarely fails overnight. It gives signals. We just need to stop ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国模仿丹麦的疫苗指南—但忘记了社会安全网- Salon.com</title><link>https://www.salon.com/2026/01/11/were-not-denmark-experts-react-to-childhood-vaccine-change/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="article__content page-article"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services changed its recommended childhood vaccine schedule to model that of Denmark. The new recommendation means &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/07/12/bonus-shots-the-benefits-of-vaccines-no-one-tells-you-about/"&gt;fewer vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Health officials will continue to recommend the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and those against polio, chickenpox and HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now they are only recommending vaccinations against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B, and hepatitis A to children who broadly face a higher risk of infections. The move is not a surprise to health officials nationwide, as it was &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/18/health/hhs-childhood-vaccine-changes"&gt;reported by CNN late last month&lt;/a&gt;. But it does reflect a bigger fallacy that has long surrounded the vaccine debate and been a talking point of anti-vaccine campaigns: if they do it in Europe, they can do it in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A major fallacy is assuming that policies that work in one country will automatically work in another,” Josh Michaud, the associate director of global health and public health policy at KFF, told Salon. “European countries differ significantly from the U.S. in terms of demographics, health care systems, social safety nets, and public health infrastructure, all of which shape their policy choices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michaud said the U.S. has its own scientific institutions and experts who are capable of reviewing evidence and developing guidelines specific for the country. “Relying on guidelines developed elsewhere risks overlooking local conditions and realities that matter for effective public health policy,” Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud pointed out that when it comes to European comparisons, there is also “selected use” of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p class="insert-quote"&gt;“Relying on guidelines developed elsewhere risks overlooking local conditions and realities that matter for effective public health policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many European countries have universal health coverage, stronger social welfare programs, and stricter gun laws than the U.S., yet those policies are rarely cited as models by officials here,” he said. “Instead, the focus has been narrowly placed on Denmark’s vaccine recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud said that experts across peer countries generally agree on “the underlying science of vaccine safety and efficacy.” It’s not that Denmark doesn’t recommend some vaccines because they’re not safe, but instead because of differences of the data and how that data is applied within the context of each country and its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-does-denmark-recommend-so-few-childhood-vaccines-danish-scientist-explains"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Jens Lundgren, an infectious disease specialist at the Copenhagen University Hospital, who said vaccine schedules should be based on a population’s needs. For example, when asked about meningococcal diseases, Lundgren said it’s not really a “public health problem” in Denmark. “We feel that there are other vaccines that should be higher on the list at the moment, at least in the Danish context,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s problematic to base U.S. vaccine policy on simply copying another country,” Michaud said. “Vaccine decisions depend on factors that vary widely across nations, including health care delivery systems, insurance coverage, public health capacity, and national priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added Denmark is not a good model for the U.S. to follow because it is “an outlier among peer countries.” Of the countries that the HHS compared the U.S. to, Denmark is the only one to recommend vaccines against as few as 10 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics said the move from the HHS was “dangerous and unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United States is not Denmark, and there is no reason to impose the Danish immunization schedule on America’s families,” Dr. Andrew Racine, AAP’s president, said in a statement. “America is a unique country, and Denmark’s population, public health infrastructure, and disease-risk differ greatly from our own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racine said that the AAP will continue to publish its own childhood vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What concerns many public health experts is the confusion this will cause parents in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reclassifying vaccines for six diseases from routine recommendations to “shared clinical decision-making” adds complexity for both providers and parents,” Michaud said. “Combined with mixed messaging from the CDC, clinicians and other groups, this change risks reducing vaccination rates and increasing cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capsule, built with a zinc-cellulose antenna and an ultra-small &lt;strong&gt;RFID chip&lt;/strong&gt;, emits a radio signal once swallowed, allowing healthcare providers to verify medication intake in real time. Most of the device safely degrades inside the digestive tract, with only the tiny chip passing through the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of system could be especially valuable for patients who require strict medication adherence, such as those recovering from organ transplants or undergoing long-term treatment for infections like HIV or tuberculosis. According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, failure to take medication as prescribed is a widespread issue that contributes to over 125,000 preventable deaths and more than $100 billion in avoidable healthcare costs every year in the United States alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project, led by &lt;em&gt;MIT’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/12957/carlo-traverso-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Giovanni Traverso&lt;/a&gt;, also a gastroenterologist at &lt;em&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/em&gt;, is part of a broader push to develop patient-friendly monitoring tools that don’t rely on wearable devices or invasive procedures. Researchers believe that integrating these capsules into existing treatment plans could help bridge critical gaps in medication adherence, especially in vulnerable or high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bioresorbable System Designed for Patient Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The capsule’s key feature lies in its degradability. The zinc-based antenna is embedded in a cellulose matrix and paired with a micro-RFID chip that does not require a &lt;strong&gt;battery&lt;/strong&gt;. As detailed in the MIT &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111706" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the outer coating (made from gelatin and a biodegradable metal such as molybdenum or tungsten) forms a Faraday cage that initially blocks signal emission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once ingested, the capsule begins to dissolve in the stomach. Within minutes, the shielding layer breaks down, activating the antenna and triggering a signal to an external reader. The signal is detected up to two feet away and can confirm the pill’s ingestion within &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the research team, nearly all components of the system degrade within the body over the course of a few days, except the RFID chip, which is safely excreted. &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JcXKJhsAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mehmet Girayhan Say&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lead authors, emphasized that the materials were selected for their safety profiles and compatibility with medical and environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology is not designed for casual over-the-counter use, but rather for clinical settings where medication adherence is critical. One such population is transplant recipients, who must take immunosuppressants on a strict schedule to prevent organ rejection. Another target group includes people undergoing treatment for chronic infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In swine models, the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/dinosaur-eggs-hold-ultimate-time-capsule/" data-type="post" data-id="100249"&gt;capsule &lt;/a&gt;successfully transmitted its signal from inside the stomach to an external receiver, even when the tag was floating in gastric fluid. As shown in in vivo imaging and tracking tests, the antenna remained operational for long enough to confirm ingestion, and then safely dissolved without causing blockage or harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67551-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SAFARI project&lt;/a&gt; (Smart Adherence via FARaday cage And Resorbable Ingestible) the ultimate goal is to offer a passive, hands-off way to log ingestion events that could then be linked to patient health records. The capsule design is also compatible with existing &lt;strong&gt;gelatin &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;HPMC capsules&lt;/strong&gt;, which streamlines integration into pharmaceutical workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eco-Conscious Materials and Minimal Health Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its clinical usefulness, the MIT capsule addresses growing concerns about &lt;strong&gt;medical waste&lt;/strong&gt; and environmental sustainability. Current ingestible electronics often use non-degradable materials, which accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract or contribute to electronic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the SAFARI capsule uses zinc and cellulose (both biodegradable and already approved for use in healthcare (along with a dissolvable protective coating. The team reports that the zinc antenna degrades at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;120 nanometers per day&lt;/strong&gt;, and Mo-based shielding disintegrates within hours after exposure to gastric fluids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from blood serum tests in animal studies showed no significant increase in zinc or molybdenum levels post-ingestion. According to the MIT researchers, both elements are essential trace nutrients, and their quantities in the device are far below known toxicity thresholds. This makes the capsule not only safe for repeated use but also well-positioned for broader &lt;strong&gt;clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now preparing for human trials and envision wearable or portable receivers that could be integrated into daily routines, offering healthcare providers near-instant feedback on whether a dose was taken, without requiring any extra effort from the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

The data is very, very clear — I mean, like decades of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712342/#:~:text=Introduction,)%2C2%20and%20certain%20cancers." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="large-scale, reputable studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6961173ee4b0120ab25d18a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712342/#:~:text=Introduction,)%2C2%20and%20certain%20cancers." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;large-scale, reputable studies&lt;/a&gt; that show that the higher in meat your diet is, the higher your chances are of getting cancer, of getting diabetes, of all-cause mortality — meaning just basically dying younger. So there really are pretty big health consequences to eating a very meat-heavy diet, especially a very red meat-heavy or processed meat-heavy diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one popular protein-forward snack that especially concerns Dunn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the fastest growing snack categories right now is meat sticks,” she said. “Obviously, the protein trend is driving that, [and though] they also are very delicious, what really surprises me, especially because we’re in this very healthy, nutritious, conscious moment right now, is that people aren’t aware of the fact that processed meats are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="class one carcinogens — Group 1 carcinogens" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6961173ee4b0120ab25d18a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;class one carcinogens — Group 1 carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s a World Health Organization classification, and it means that we know that they cause cancer in humans. So this is really something that I think more people should think about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn noted that the average American doesn’t need to supplement their diet with extra protein because they’re probably already getting the recommended daily allowance in their meals. However, if we are looking for more protein, she urged us to get it from whole foods, rather than processed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that there’s protein in most foods, which means even people who don’t eat meat shouldn’t need to work too hard to get their daily needs met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as you’re making a concerted effort as a vegetarian to eat a lot of different plants, like, you’re gonna get as much protein as you need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelson noted that “a cup of spinach ... has five grams of protein in it, a cup of raw peas has eight grams of protein ... wild rice has six grams of protein in a cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains are also a “huge source of protein,” Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not just talking about quinoa — oats have a lot of protein in them, things like seeds, like hemp seeds and chia seeds, have a lot of protein ...

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best breakfast for high blood pressure is high in protein, fiber and leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein and fiber help keep blood sugar steady, which in turn affects blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach provide dietary nitrates that improve blood flow and circulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast can be an easy way to start the day with nutrients your body needs to feel and function well. A balanced morning meal helps provide fiber, protein and key vitamins and minerals that support steady energy and overall health. Research suggests that people who eat breakfast regularly often have healthier eating habits and may be less likely to have high blood pressure, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-avoid-to-reduce-stroke-risk-11783242" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;major risk factor for heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

He stresses the importance of eating a breakfast rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and dietary nitrates from dark leafy greens. These nutrients help prevent blood glucose spikes and insulin resistance, which both contribute to elevated blood pressure. And this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt; is a smart way to support healthy blood pressure first thing in the day. Protein-rich eggs help you feel satisfied, while fiber from whole-grain toast and raspberries supports steadier blood sugar and appetite control. Spinach adds potassium and other nutrients that play a role in blood vessel function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together, this protein-, fiber- and leafy green-packed breakfast delivers lasting energy without weighing you down, making it easier to stay fueled and make heart-healthy choices all morning.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-building-a-better-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Building a Better Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Blood pressure is a complex interaction of various forces,” says Twyman. Of course, there’s nutrition, but timing matters too. “Most people should eat their largest meal of the day in the morning and ideally within one hour of sunrise,” he says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, here’s Twyman’s easy formula for a blood pressure-lowering breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Protein is important for muscle synthesis, so shoot for at least 30 grams of protein at your first meal of the day,” says Twyman. What does muscle have to do with blood pressure? One study showed that greater lean muscle mass is associated with a lower risk of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you really want to build more muscle, you’ll need to add in resistance training. So, be sure to include a couple of strength-training sessions in your weekly exercise routine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe supplies 18 grams of protein. But if you want to hit that 30-gram target, you can add 2 large eggs. You may be thinking, “Wait! Don’t I need to worry about how many eggs I’m eating if I’m trying to be mindful of heart health?” Yes, eggs contain cholesterol (about 200 milligrams per large egg).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;However, “dietary cholesterol does not raise serum cholesterol, so don't worry about the cholesterol content of eggs,” Twyman explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15803/is-saturated-fat-truly-bad-for-your-heart/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;? “Some people are more sensitive to a diet high in saturated fat, so monitor your lipids with routine blood work to see if you are susceptible,” recommends Twyman. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But most of us don’t need to worry. While eggs contain some saturated fat, they have less than you might expect. In fact, one whole large egg only has 1.6 grams of saturated fat, which isn’t much if your overall diet is pretty low in saturated fat, to begin with.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you’re still concerned, you can use egg whites for protein without the saturated fat or opt to add nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-vs-yogurt-which-is-better-for-gut-health-11797224" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt; instead of additional eggs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that complex interaction of forces that impact blood pressure that Twyman mentioned? Blood glucose is one of them. So, avoiding glucose spikes and preventing insulin resistance is key. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s why: Chronically high blood sugar can cause endothelial damage, meaning your blood vessels cannot function properly. And for people living with diabetes, high blood sugar levels make it difficult for the body to produce nitric oxide, an important vasodilator that opens up the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow easily.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, this may lead to elevated blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is eating a breakfast that’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; slows digestion and helps prevent blood glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing fiber with protein balances your breakfast and makes it even more effective. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Dietary Nitrates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Foods high in dietary nitrates, like dark leafy greens and beets, provide the body with compounds that help produce nitric oxide,” says Twyman. Studies show that loss of nitric oxide production is one of the first steps in the development of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Including spinach in your breakfast scramble is an easy way to increase your intake of dietary nitrates. But if spinach isn’t your thing, you can also get plenty of blood pressure–lowering &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959424/what-are-nitrates-are-they-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates&lt;/a&gt; in your diet from arugula, Swiss chard, basil, parsley, radishes, bok choy and beets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

This winning combo of eggs and black beans delivers 19 grams of protein and 11 grams of fiber. Then spinach provides those dietary nitrates that help open your blood vessels for optimal blood flow. Using leftover cooked brown rice is an easy way to get this breakfast on the table fast. Canned beans and prewashed baby spinach are also huge timesavers.&lt;/li&gt;

A breakfast sandwich is a tasty, convenient way to work nitrate-rich greens into your morning. Here, you’ll get a double shot courtesy of wilted spinach and arugula. This sandwich also provides 15 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. &lt;/li&gt;

A big bowl of greens is a fantastic way to work in those nitrates. But the blood pressure benefits of this breakfast don’t stop there. Smoked salmon provides a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669415/signs-you-might-not-be-eating-enough-omega-3s/#:~:text=Victoria%20Seaver%2C%20M.S.%2C%20R.D.%2C,and%20diastolic%20blood%20pressure%20levels." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, another key nutrient for lower blood pressure. This bowl also boasts 15 grams of protein plus 6 grams of fiber. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

In Costa Rica, this popular breakfast bean dish, called gallo pinto, traditionally calls for rice. For extra fiber, we sub in cooked barley. But feel free to use whatever leftover cooked whole grain you have on hand. In addition to 10 grams of fiber, you’ll also score 16 grams of protein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As rich in protein as these meals are, you may have noticed they don’t hit that magical 30-gram number. Not to worry. Round out your meal with a single-serve container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt for an easy 16 grams of additional high-quality protein, plus calcium and potassium, two minerals that also promote healthy blood pressure.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A healthy, balanced breakfast can do great things for your heart health and your blood pressure. For a cardiologist-approved morning meal, aim for a combo of protein, fiber and leafy greens, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt;. Its protein and fiber prevent blood sugar spikes and support metabolic health. Plus, its protein helps maintain lean muscle mass, which may also reduce your risk of high blood pressure. For an extra dose of protection, leafy green spinach delivers blood pressure–lowering nitrates plus additional fiber. Now, that’s what we call a recipe for heart health!

All you have to do is put on a weighted backpack or rucksack and start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low-impact exercise that is pretty much based on military training — think about how the military trains a lot for endurance, they do a fair amount of running, but they also have to carry a lot of heavy equipment, so that’s kind of how rucking started,” said &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mathew Welch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Mathew Welch&lt;/a&gt;, an exercise physiologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this exercise offers some extra health rewards on top of a regular walking regimen. Here’s what experts say you should know about rucking and how to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rucking adds resistance training to your walk, and has a host of other fitness benefits, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking brings more of a challenge to your daily walk, which is a good thing for someone who is looking to work their body in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physically, walking is awesome, but sometimes we want to amplify that, and the easy way to do that is adding weight,” Cihlar said. “Resistance training is key, especially as we age, in helping our bone health and our muscle growth because that naturally deteriorates as we get older, starting in our 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking takes your walk from a cardio exercise to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cardio plus resistance training. It’s recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="you do 20 minutes of strength training" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;you do 20 minutes of strength training&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research shows that" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; most people do not hit that minimum. Rucking can be one way to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is also good for your cardiovascular endurance, Welch said. Specifically, rucking benefits your “cardiac output, it’s going to help with the efficiency of your heart pumping the blood out,” Welch explained. This can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart rate, so it’s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also good for your posture and back strength. “The ruck is kind of pulling you back, so it really forces you to maintain your posture,” Welch said, who added that it’s a good way to offset the hours and hours and hours of sitting you likely do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Going for a walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack on your back is a good way to add resistance training to your walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus, rucking is good for your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is an exercise you do outdoors, and getting outside in itself is great for your mental health. According to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mental Health America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Mental Health America&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside is linked to lower levels of stress and a better mood overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the body produces vitamin D" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;the body produces vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight, which is important for bone health and can even help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="curb depression and anxiety symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;curb depression and anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to always say you never come back from a ruck in a bad mood. It gives you time to clear your head,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are simple ways you can start rucking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting rucking doesn’t have to be complicated. “What’s nice is you can literally start with a backpack you have in your closet and ... throw some magazines in it ... your water bottle,” Cihlar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a rucksack and rucksack weights if you want to use something that is officially made for the sport. Both experts said a rucksack is preferable because it’s safer. A regular backpack can sit pretty low on your back, which can cause issues if you’re carrying around a heavy bag. If you do decide to opt for a backpack, just make sure it isn’t sagging too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much weight you’ll want to carry on your back, that depends on your strength level and your size. “I always say start low because you can always grow from there,” Cihlar said. “You don’t want to start heavy and get discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t a frequent exerciser or weightlifter, starting with just 5 or 10 pounds and building on that is a good idea, she said. As for distance, start with a mile and see how you feel, Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if you’re someone that is regularly active and you lift weights, you could probably do a 20-pound plate, a 30-pound plate in your ruck,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with a mile is a good idea here, too, said Welch, but you can bump it up to a mile and a half or more if you don’t feel challenged. For an additional challenge, take your workout to hilly terrain, Welch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, you can design your own rucking workout regimen to fit your workout goals and fitness level. You can start small with light weights and a short walk, or, if you’re up for it, take a heavier backpack on an incline walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you listen to your body and know your limits, there’s no wrong way to start incorporating this exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPSVQyb0wzVVFyR1RqV1U0bG9Vbm1kb1VldEd4S2NwVXRvNV9SOTFwQlhyY3ZoVExsRTVCM2RrYjBwdjZyMHhQMmVXSzM0Y1d2MkVRRy1JVW5KTDhwMGVmNGswSlNJWW9BZjlxQmhkSFRKaFgyOWc4aEFtWHQ4UTY3elpuT081LXVyTFdud01hYjRGcENFUzQxatIBngFBVV95cUxPMTVXYVp5bi1nY0RwZlZzbk1mT0FxRDBzbk1MYlk0LXdVZWFCS0pfNHQ3UENOaWJLT3dTMVN0SXZoTDlOd0JYX3RYNzhvb0hkU3RsWmFvWkh2R1dOMFc3aHo1dWozRWRtRjFEb2t1QU5yNGphQXduYzAzQ3NqdExjUFhHcURKNGMyNGM1Q1phOWpKRkNmWUtNcnI0NGZydw</guid></item><item><title>如果您因为走上楼梯而被缠住，这意味着什么- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-does-it-mean-if-you-get-tired-walking-stairs-goog_l_695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ascended a flight or two of stairs, you likely know the feeling of being out of breath once you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common occurrence among folks of all ages and fitness abilities.

While it can be normal, it can also be cause for concern or even a fitness challenge to try and improve. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be perfectly normal — going up stairs is harder on your body than walking on a flat surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs is “what we call a normal physiological response,” said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine and sports medicine doctor at University of Louisville Health. “Because you’ve got this increased demand on your body, you’ve got increased work — you’ve got increased oxygen demand and ventilatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re winded for a minute or so but can easily catch your breath, it’s no cause for concern, said &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Karl Erickson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Karl Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, a performance specialist at Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite normal ... you’re essentially lifting your body. You’re doing a squat or a lunge when you go up the stairs,” said Erickson, “so, definitely more effortful than just walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how winded you are will vary; you’ll be more out of breath if you run up the stairs or walk up with a heavy suitcase than if you leisurely walked up the stairs. Some folks may not even notice the breathlessness as much as others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve got an elite athlete ― like, I doubt Caitlin Clark gets winded going up a flight of stairs ― but for the average middle-aged person, and, unfortunately, especially here in the United States, we tend to live a little bit more sedentary lifestyle, so it can be very normal to get winded just going up one flight of stairs,” Pohlgeers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s a new change or you’re noticing prolonged breathlessness, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be perfectly normal to feel winded after climbing the stairs, there are a few red flags that may signal a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your breathlessness a new issue that’s never happened before? Or is it getting worse? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, you should talk to a doctor about potential underlying issues, according to Pohlgeers. “The biggest thing is for people not to necessarily think, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m dying,’ but also, don’t always just simply dismiss it as, ‘Well, I’m out of shape.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are things that we really take seriously,” Pohlgeers added. “If there is a change in the exercise capacity, just making sure that we as doctors are able to do our due diligence and rule out any underlying conditions, so that we can maximize people’s lifestyles and help them be as healthy as they possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying conditions such as heart failure, obesity, chronic lung disease, being a smoker, COPD and even being &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog_l_68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anemic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anemic&lt;/a&gt; can all make the breathlessness you feel after &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; up stairs worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long it takes you to recover is always a good indicator, too,” Erickson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for your breathing to be faster for a minute or two after walking up a bunch of stairs, Erickson explained. “But if it’s staying elevated past three minutes or a prolonged period of time, that’s when it becomes more concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice chest pain, headache or vision changes along with the breathlessness, that’s worrisome and worth chatting with your doctor about too, Pohlgeers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you're good. That's a very good sign."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can build your stair-climbing endurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less winded after climbing the stairs, start doing it more often (as long as you don’t have any underlying conditions that can put your health at risk). If you have issues such as heart failure or COPD that make climbing stairs a challenge, get those treated first, Pohlgeers stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body adapts to imposed demands on it. So, if you’re practicing going up the stairs, you become more efficient,” Erickson said. The muscles needed to climb the stairs will strengthen the more you use them, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll ask patients, actually, that are getting ready to go into surgery, it’s like a pre-op clearance: ‘Could you carry groceries up three to four flights of stairs?’” Pohlgeers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s OK if you’re out of breath by the top of the three or four flights of stairs. The concern is can you physically do it without having symptoms like chest pain, vision changes or a headache, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you’re good. That’s a very good sign,” Pohlgeers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing your base strength levels — doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lunges" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="squats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, that’s going to give you more power, more strength to go up [stairs],” Erickson added. Improving your cardiovascular fitness can also help decrease the fatigue you feel at the top of the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working on building up your endurance, do so gradually, Pohlgeers suggested. You don’t need to go up and down the stairs five times in a row. Instead, slowly build up your fitness ability in a sustainable and even enjoyable way, whether that’s by doing more yard work, going on walks with your neighbor or taking up gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on your strength and cardiovascular fitness, your stair-climbing endurance should also improve, according to Erickson. You’ll be easily climbing back-to-back flights of stairs in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOQ0NUY3dWXy1Kblg2SllVeFpyXzlVcHEwX0NCa05UTzNNV29MVDJYQlh6ZHJHX0hRbVBTZjNJbG4yY3MxWGRPbWIwU3FYMGV1LS02TVp6U2h1Qkx2eEhGOGZzRERReFB2MW1ZNC1oMkltUHBUTGthVTFWdWNfUm82ZUlHd3B1X1dTa19KOFZTWmdZMHAwcm1nbUNsSURCbkVKb1dFOXNndWpNS3dSU2lwd2p30gG3AUFVX3lxTE05eXUwc3BJcnZYUWZRY1JkNHR1ZGM1UlVsVEhZYlB6QkR5QUNYU2xac0tTaUVGNC11UW1kR0JEblBtdGQzWk1jWkNaYkVHbktZRVJLTzhhQVhaZHhkVVdmVTdFaGFUTkt5U0diVXFwNEJQWXR5S3R6c2NEeDA1NHN4V1JkNnFwZC11Zy1xWUk2LWNIYkxxX3pRZUZja0pBQWNaV3lDMGZoYm5IYWgzWnlhR2todG5NTQ</guid></item><item><title>令人惊讶的心脏病发作症状以及如果您有心脏病发作，该怎么办- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/surprising-heart-attack-symptoms/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;With a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/new-study-weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-could-lower-heart-attack-risk/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which is when the blood flow to the heart is blocked and thus limits the body's oxygen supply, the first symptom that likely comes to mind is chest pain. But that isn't the only way a heart attack can manifest. Also known as a myocardial infarction, a heart attack can affect anyone of any age, so it's best to prepare yourself with the knowledge you need to recognize and address this medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Below, we outline the more surprising symptoms associated with a heart attack, along with what you should do if you or someone you know is experiencing one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1cb2cdbf-9df0-48c1-b25f-3ae09a66fd68" data-ng-block="{"&gt; Heart attack symptoms, both common and unexpected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain isn't the only symptom of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;magicmine/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think "heart attack," classic symptoms such as chest discomfort might first come to mind. Heart attacks can present differently in men and women and in people with certain diseases, like diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attack symptoms could include:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-ng-block="{" id&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest discomfort, pain or pressure that radiates up to your jaw, your back and/or your left shoulder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad indigestion or nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extreme fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling generally unwell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially anything from the belly button up," says Dr. Khadijah Breathett, a heart failure transplant cardiologist and tenured associate professor of medicine at Indiana University. "Constant pressure should raise concern that you should see your doctor, and it's OK if it's something else. We'd rather have an individual come see a health care professional and get evaluated rather than toughing it out at home, because that is what contributes to the escalating risk of death."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c33faa9d-361f-42a3-94d3-7e948ee2970f" data-ng-block="{"&gt;What to do during a heart attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is experiencing any of the above symptoms, these are the steps you should follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a3d7146c-2f7d-4869-bd03-fbb53e0870e3" data-ng-block="{"&gt;1. Call 911, no matter what &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel any of the above symptoms, even if you aren't sure it's a heart attack, you should call 911 immediately, doctors recommend.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you feel unwell, or you're starting to have chest discomfort, seek medical attention quickly, because the sooner you get treated, the better," says Dr. Grant Reed, an interventional cardiologist and director of Cleveland Clinic's STEMI program. "A lot of patients ignore their symptoms, and by the time they come in, their heart muscle has already died."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call 911 immediately if you notice any potential heart attack symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Richard T.

There's a strong relationship between when you start to have your heart attack (which is generally when symptoms start) and how fast doctors can open up the blocked coronary artery that's causing it -- the shorter the time, the &lt;a target="_self" data-id="4e82eff0-a8d7-49ae-9096-5846b0bdc320" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16750682/"&gt;better the outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, not just regarding survival but also the likelihood of heart failure or needing to be readmitted to the hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get to the hospital, medical professionals will likely perform an electrocardiogram, which will determine the diagnosis of a heart attack. If it is a heart attack, you'll be taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a coronary angiography will be performed. If you have a blockage in your coronary artery, the doctors will offer treatment with a balloon and a stent to keep the artery open.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are hesitant to seek emergency medical care due to a lack of insurance or immigration status. In the US, hospitals are required to treat all people who come in with life-threatening emergencies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a lot better to be treated and deal with the financial ramifications after the fact," Reed says, adding that, in most cases, the costs can be sorted out with the hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of driving yourself to the hospital, call an ambulance to keep yourself and others safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="34548bba-aafa-4f87-a59a-303d1a35b4e6" data-ng-block="{"&gt;2. Have an ambulance take you to the hospital   &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't drive yourself to the hospital: Call an ambulance. You could lose consciousness and hurt yourself or others on the road, says Dr. Joel Beachey, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The same goes for having a loved one drive you -- if your symptoms worsen, they won't be able to help you while they're driving, and may be distracted.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramedics can provide the best and fastest care while you're on the way to the hospital, including giving you an assessment and providing some treatment, Beachey says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're with someone who is having heart attack symptoms and becomes unconscious, you should first call 911 and then engage in CPR, Breathett says. (You can find free CPR training at your local &lt;a target="_self" data-id="f3f14a6e-afad-4864-b515-89fbb81d888a" href="https://www.heart.org/"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; branch and many other places.)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1dd5fa33-32e9-40db-87ca-6654b5690b20" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Take aspirin, if you have it &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're having heart attack symptoms and have access to aspirin, take a full dose of 325 mg after calling the ambulance, says Beachey. (If you have baby aspirin, which comes in an 81 mg dose, take four of those.) He recommends chewing it instead of swallowing, so it gets into your system faster.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? When you're having a heart attack, a plaque inside your arteries becomes unstable and ruptures, which forms a blood clot that can close off the supply to that artery. Taking aspirin can help break down some of that blood clot.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;ER Productions Limited/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="d6ee91cc-a544-458e-87a6-ebfa304cc304" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4. Advocate for yourself   &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, healthcare providers would take all patient concerns seriously when it comes to heart attack symptoms, but studies show women and people of color are less likely to receive adequate treatment for heart attacks and heart disease. For example, older Black women were 50% less likely to be treated when they arrived at a hospital with a heart attack or coronary artery disease symptoms than white women, including after accounting for education, income, insurance status and other heart health complications like diabetes and high blood pressure, a &lt;a target="_self" data-id="a77d7532-0b90-4fce-982f-40d0d9b0c5c8" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/racial-disparities-continue-for-black-women-seeking-heart-health-care?preview=b3de"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been very clear over most of our history in the US that women and people of color are not heard," Breathett says. "Their symptoms get dismissed, and they have worse outcomes. As a health care system, we have a lot more work to do to change that system so that each person can get equitable care irrespective of their demographic."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that time comes, patients need to be their own advocates and speak up for themselves, she adds. If they aren't being heard, they have the right to seek care elsewhere.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One tip recommended by a resident on TikTok: If you feel a provider isn't taking your symptoms seriously, for heart health or otherwise, you can ask the provider, "What is your differential diagnosis?"   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A differential diagnosis is a term to describe the different diseases that could be contributing to your symptoms. You're basically asking the provider to explain why they've ruled out a heart attack and what else it could be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That might help a person realize, 'Oh, I haven't effectively tested to make sure this is not cardiac disease,'" Breathett says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also bring a family member or friend to help ask questions on your behalf. Write down questions in advance if possible, so you can have them addressed during your brief visit. And call back with any questions that weren't answered. If you're not satisfied or feel that you're not being heard, seek out another care team.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="dcf2c828-5e90-4023-8e3f-16992608bbf0" data-ng-block="{"&gt;5.

You should get regular physical exams with your primary care provider to assess your risk and make lifestyle changes that can help with prevention. Some people might also benefit from taking a baby aspirin every day as a preventative measure, but you'll need to talk to your care provider about that.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is important even if you have a history of heart trouble, says Beachey.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to do to prevent and respond to a heart attack is just one of the many important elements of your health you should know about.

			&lt;p&gt;There is no strong evidence that replenishing hormones after menopause is linked to dementia, according to a sweeping  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review is the most rigorous investigation to date of the link between cognitive health and menopause hormone therapy (MHT), also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which seeks to replenish ovarian hormones after the cessation of menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which covers the health data of more than a million women, was commissioned by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), which currently provides no specific guidance on dementia and MHT, despite &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/study-linking-hrt-with-dementia-risk-unhelpful"&gt;recent controversy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-drug-reduces-breast-cancer-growth-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Menopause Drug Reduces Breast Cancer Growth In Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This review will help to inform the upcoming WHO guidelines on reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which are expected to be released in 2026," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/menopause-hormone-therapy-does-not-appear-impact-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; senior author Aimee Spector, a clinical psychologist from University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/hormone-replacement-therapy/"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that when prescribed properly, hormone replacement therapy is safe and very effective at treating symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, poor sleep, low libido, and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of life benefits for the average healthy person &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;generally outweigh&lt;/a&gt; the potential risks of MHT, which can include a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/benefits-and-risks-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;very small increased risk of blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/risk/risk-factors/using-hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;slightly increased chance of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; for those with specific risk factors. But these risk increases still depend on the timing, hormone mix and even delivery method of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-symptoms-may-be-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-study-shows"&gt;menopause is linked to dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and that hormone changes in life &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-goes-through-5-distinct-epochs-massive-study-finds"&gt;are associated with changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, it is not yet clear if MHT helps or hinders cognition as a person ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Menopause hormone therapy is widely used to manage menopausal symptoms, yet its impact on memory, cognition, and dementia risk remains one of the most debated issues in women's health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/menopause-hormone-therapy-does-not-appear-impact-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and aging cognition researcher Melissa Melville from UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones"&gt;Conflicting research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/benefits-and-risks-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about potential harms have fueled public and clinical debate, leaving women and clinicians unsure whether menopause hormone therapy might raise or reduce their risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the current analysis was unable to find any &lt;span&gt;strong evidence that MHT impacts the risk of dementia, either for better or worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most studies were &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/study-linking-hrt-with-dementia-risk-unhelpful"&gt;observational only&lt;/a&gt;, which means they can't prove cause or effect. Their results show inconsistent and slight associations with dementia, some positive and some negative, but all with very low certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these studies, MHT formulations, doses, and prescription timing varied considerably, making comparisons difficult. Women who start MHT formulations after the age of 60, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/when-to-take-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;may face more risks&lt;/a&gt;, and the medication may not be as advisable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/198994"&gt;one randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that estrogen-only MHT products may increase the risk of dementia in women over the age of 65. But the certainty of those results, the authors of the review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, is "low due to serious imprecision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absolute risk difference was 6.27 additional cases per 1000 women, indicating little to no difference in dementia risk when initiated after age 65 years," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt; Melville and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;2024 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; Commission on dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which also found insufficient evidence to suggest MHT increases or decreases the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also align with a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-to-remove-black-box-warnings-from-menopause-hormone-therapy-heres-why"&gt;November announcement&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detailing plans to remove the 'black box' warnings on MHT products, which had previously cautioned about an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this same announcement, the FDA cited &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1996.00440180075009"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested HRT products might actually &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. But this new review suggests that claim is not supported by robust evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dew027"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; also recommend MHT for the prevention of dementia if someone has experienced premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, available evidence to date does not support MHT solely for risk reduction of dementia nor does MHT increase dementia risk," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; Melville and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a need for further high-quality research &lt;span&gt;to clarify the role of MHT in relation to dementia.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review research team specifically calls for further data on those who enter menopause prematurely, either because of a hysterectomy, where the uterus is surgically removed, or an &lt;span&gt;oophorectomy&lt;/span&gt;, where one or both of the ovaries are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-both-ovaries-could-come-at-a-serious-cost-to-the-brain-researchers-find"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that having an &lt;span&gt;oophorectomy&lt;/span&gt; under the age of 50 can come with a serious risk to the brain. A hysterectomy, meanwhile, is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hysterectomy-significantly-raises-risk-of-stroke-new-evidence-suggests"&gt;tied to a higher risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;.

		&lt;p&gt;Flu cases continue to rise in western Maine, causing more emergency room and acute care visits as doctors stretch to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/11/25/california-nonprofit-can-acquire-central-maine-healthcare-in-lewiston-state-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Central Maine Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, which owns Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston as well as a variety of care facilities and physician practices, said Friday that the system is experiencing more hospital admissions and emergency and outpatient visits amid &lt;a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/24/flu-cases-spiking-in-maine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the season’s earlier-than-usual surge&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say the region’s most common strain, Influenza A, H3N2, is typically more contagious and severe than other strains.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;Statewide, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2553.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2553.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;8% of doctor’s office visits&lt;/a&gt; last week were for influenza-like symptoms, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This time last year, it was &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2501.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2501.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;less than 4%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine’s doctors are experiencing the increased demand through appointment waitlists, call delays and staffing shortages, said Michael Stadnicki, a doctor at Central Maine Family Medicine in Lewiston.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone that works in health care also has the ability to get sick,” Stadnicki said. “There’s more people on the team that are out, so less hands to answer phones, less people to get patients in rooms and be seen, and providers that may succumb to this as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Androscoggin County had 102 positive cases and 17 flu-related hospitalizations last week — the fourth highest in the state. York County had the most positive cases at 246, and Kennebec County had 82 cases but only one hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 10 deaths statewide from flu this season, including three in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike COVID-19, experts say the flu comes on abruptly. A patient might feel fine one hour and be overcome with exhaustion and chills the next, making it easier for the virus to spread undetected in the day before symptoms start and the days after they end. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s typical to see an increase in the flu after the holidays, but this year’s spike began in the middle of December, causing “missed school time and holiday plan interruptions for our pediatric patients,” said Lara Walsh, medical director of MaineGeneral Pediatrics in Augusta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While younger residents ages 5 to 24 are reporting the most positive cases, those 65 and older have had the most hospitalizations due to flu. Three long-term care facilities in Androscoggin County have reported outbreaks this season, and Stadnicki said that number could rise into February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu seems to be more intense for people this year, especially for folks that have underlying vulnerabilities like heart disease or COPD, or are taking some medications that might suppress their immune system,” said Amy Madden, medical director for HealthReach, which operates community health clinics across central Maine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not a great time,” she added. “Get your flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s vaccine protects against three main seasonal flu viruses. While there’s a slight mismatch in the vaccine due to viral mutation, experts say it still offers strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, vaccine fatigue and hesitancy are on the rise nationwide. Coupled with less exposure to common colds during the pandemic, Stadnicki says it’s become more difficult for people to naturally fight the flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “I think this really is one of those culmination of perfect storms: ‘I haven’t had natural colds and flu in a handful of years,’ maybe someone’s skipping the vaccine this year or last year or both, and now we’re starting to finally mix more and more,” he said. “So you’re definitely getting hit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Express care facilities in central and western Maine report high numbers of patients with flu or flu-like symptoms. Jason Brown, senior medical director of MaineGeneral Primary Care, said staff is working to meet increased demand for same-day visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madden said HealthReach clinics are seeing more patients with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and those who say they have been sick at home for a week and are “just not getting better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients who already have the flu are advised to rest, hydrate, stay home and speak to their primary care doctor about medication to treat symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But prevention is the best tool to fight the flu, experts say. People should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their faces and support their immune systems through adequate sleep, exercise and a balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to miss living your life,” Stadnicki said. “So whether it’s a vacation, a get-together, a night out, anything that anyone’s looking forward to — if you don’t do the right things to mitigate your risk, you might miss something that you actually want to do because you don’t feel well enough to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

As cases rise, a newly released study offers surprising insight into how influenza spreads and how people may better protect themselves from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how flu moves from person to person, researchers from the University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore designed an unusual experiment. College students who were already infected with influenza were placed in a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. Despite close contact, none of the healthy participants became infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission -- what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the Flu Did Not Spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published on January 7 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;, represents the first controlled clinical trial to closely examine airborne flu transmission between people who were naturally infected, rather than intentionally infected in a laboratory, and people who were not infected. Milton and his colleague Dr. Jianyu Lai explored several reasons why none of the volunteers became ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission -- coughing is a major one," said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the infected students carried high levels of virus in their noses, Lai explained that they rarely coughed. As a result, only small amounts of virus were released into the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventilation also played a key role. "The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. The air in our study room was continually mixed rapidly by a heater and dehumidifier and so the small amounts of virus in the air were diluted," Lai said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age may have been another protective factor. According to Lai, middle-aged adults tend to be less vulnerable to influenza than younger adults, which likely contributed to the absence of infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What This Means for Flu Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists believe that airborne transmission is a major driver of flu spread. However, Milton emphasized that changes to global infection-control guidelines require strong evidence from randomized clinical trials like this one. The research team is continuing its work to better understand how flu spreads through inhalation and under what conditions that transmission is most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of transmission observed in this study provides valuable clues about how people can reduce their risk during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing -- and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95," said Milton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the Flu Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research took place on a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel and included five participants with confirmed influenza symptoms and 11 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted across two groups during 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine design had been used in earlier research, along with specialized testing of exhaled breath developed by Milton and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants lived on the isolated hotel floor for two weeks and followed daily routines designed to mimic real-life social interactions. These included casual conversations and physical activities such as yoga, stretching, and dancing. Infected participants also handled shared items like a pen, tablet computer, and microphone, which were then passed around the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers closely tracked symptoms and collected daily nasal swabs, saliva samples, and blood samples to monitor infection and antibody development. They measured viral exposure both in the air participants breathed and in the room itself. Exhaled breath samples were collected daily using the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Flu Research Still Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding better ways to limit flu outbreaks remains a major public health priority, according to Milton. Influenza continues to place a heavy burden on health systems worldwide. Each year, up to 1 billion people globally become infected with seasonal flu. In the United States alone this season, there have already been at least 7.5 million cases, leading to 81,000 hospitalizations and more than 3,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included contributions from researchers at UMD's interdisciplinary Public Health Aerobiology Lab, including Kristen Coleman, Yi Esparza, Filbert Hong, Isabel Sierra Maldonado, Kathleen McPhaul and S.H. Sheldon Tai, as well as collaborators from the UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research came from the NIAID Cooperative agreement U19 grant (5U19AI162130), the University of Maryland Baltimore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower), and gifts from The Flu Lab and Balvi Filantropic Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I’ve been through surgery and radiation treatments. According to the oncologists, I should now consider myself a “survivor.” Since I have scars, I’m taking medication for the next 10 years that has potentially really bad side effects, and the chance of reoccurrence is a definite possibility, I don’t feel like a “survivor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XD4BJ2HF3FBZ5J2CPP5JQHI7O4"&gt; I readily admit that I’m depressed. I maintain that this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to something bad that has upended and changed my whole life for the foreseeable future. I’m not suicidal, and although some mornings are hard, I get up every day, shower, brush my hair and teeth and maintain my usual schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XERLV72NB5EBJH7PYWHXBBWHNQ"&gt; The worst thing to me about cancer is that I can’t talk to anyone because I’ve gone from an actual person with thoughts and interests to people only wanting to know about the cancer. It’s all anyone asks about. That being the case, I tried to talk to people about how I feel, but the word “depressed” freaks people out more than “cancer.” Now I just say I’m fine or OK to make others feel comfortable, which applies to my doctors as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EVCETBQZUBDAVCVRLFHY22F5KE"&gt; I don’t need medication, and I tried online and in-person group discussions a few times, and they aren’t for me. I’ve noticed the same thing with people who lose a loved one or have something else bad happen -- they aren’t allowed to be depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4KTRIQBNONECLLFFZOFPZ2XSEA"&gt; When did it become shameful and something that needs to be fixed when people have a true human emotion to events? Sad things should understandably make us sad -- and maybe depressed? Please note, I’m not talking about people with real diagnosed clinical depression or other mental issues. -- Sad “Survivor”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NSUUG75AIVF2RC2CHTH3J7C6CE"&gt; Dear Sad “Survivor”: The word “survivor” may sound triumphant, yes, but it doesn’t cancel out the fear, pain and lifelong change you’ve endured to get here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XBLJEFBKRFHXZCPE2QWRGL3XAE"&gt; It is a victory to be where you are today, and there’s nothing troubling about feeling conflicted. What is troubling is feeling you have to hide it -- especially from your doctors, who need the full picture, whether it’s pretty or not. You’re allowed to say, “I’m getting through it, but it’s still hard,” and you deserve people in your corner who can hear that without panicking or minimizing it, no matter how uncomfortable it may make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AKRN73MG2VE67LXA5ZZLBRXBWA"&gt; Healing doesn’t happen overnight. Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes and ask honestly for the support you need. A survivor isn’t someone who feels strong all the time; it’s someone who keeps going despite hardship. By that measure, you absolutely are one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY" data-fusion-component="SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY" data-fusion-component="SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KBS5BB2UAFFXZAS3VFHZOZ5FEI"&gt;Dear Annie: After 15 years, my wife says she is filing for divorce. I’m disabled and don’t drive. I work part time and receive disability money.

From what you describe, your wife has carried a lot of the day-to-day -- transportation, paying bills, keeping everything afloat -- which can wear a person down. That doesn’t mean this is your fault, but it might explain some of the “bitterness” you’ve picked up on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7SMOALE6JECLG2L3WDDCOEMCU"&gt; If she’s willing, ask for an honest conversation. You might not be able to change her mind or salvage the relationship, but getting some answers can help you at least make sense of its ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4CW6RMWCIVCHPAVGLW7QR4VF5Q"&gt; In the meantime, focus on building independence where you can -- transportation alternatives, financial management, legal advice.

What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled. "And an image of a cluster became more clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. "There's all these different levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called "original 48".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps," Lucas recalled. "We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. "He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important," Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was "the only one listening to them," said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He's an incredible human and physician," said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough," Nicholson said. "But he was such a pillar of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's like reading a movie script," emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We are all in the movie!", a senior federal scientist replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. "I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying," he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it "one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all owe you a debt of gratitude," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"All available evidence and logic" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was "not expected to pose risks" to human health or the environment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. "I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said. "Full stop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero declined to discuss it. "Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. "Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations," wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. "When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum," Lucas said. "And I choose him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, "What now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email," said Lucas. "He just has so many patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that," Strickland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. "I think I waited four months for that letter," Strickland recalled. "I kept phoning and asking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero "did nothing for April," Strickland said. "I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she recalled. "Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. "Those were the words he used," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. "As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND," Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. "And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me," she said. "I hit every single marker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. "The stigma is difficult," she said, "but I've accepted it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she "just needed to find a boyfriend", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. "I've done nothing with my life since I got sick," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans.

Marrero had never crossed "any kind of line," Stacie said. "He's pristine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"That's why all his patients like him," Andre said. "Love him, maybe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said, dejectedly. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. "As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly," he said. "But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Marrero in his home office. "I was part of it, but I was not it," he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It has to be a patient complaint," they said. "And all his patients love him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. "She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom," her stepmother said. "It's a very limited life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero "deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people." But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. "The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas in her back garden. "I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became "choked up", she said. "It eats him up, he's fighting back tears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he "took the utmost care to abide by" the laws around Maid and had "never proposed it" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control.

What experts are seeing, however, is that it easily transmits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It appears that it's probably going to have an ability to at least be slightly less sensitive to antibody or vaccine-mediated protection," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deakin University epidemiology professor Catherine Bennett told SBS News: "This new subvariant of the H3N2 is that bit more immune evasive with these latest mutations in the part of the virus that allows it to invade our cells, making us more susceptible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bennett said the 2025 flu vaccine included H3N2, but not this specific class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Flu vaccines wane in effectiveness, so people vaccinated back in April-May and only getting infected now won't have the same benefit," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the 2026 flu vaccine for the southern hemisphere has already been updated to include this variant, and will likely be available around April, Bennett said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said the flu vaccine remains worthwhile and provides important protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It still significantly reduces the risk of severe disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;What does a typical flu season look like in Australia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we get seasonal influenza every year in Australia, or anywhere, it's a combination of three viruses," said Reading. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two influenza A viruses — a H3N2 and H1N1 — and one influenza B virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Australian Centre for Disease Control, there were 365,261 reports of the flu in 2024. Cases spiked between May and August, and drastically dropped following the winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As we move into spring, flu generally comes down in Australia, and then it's very low during summer," said Reading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year there were 502,493 reports of influenza, with cases clearly continuing until the end of the year following those winter months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to GISAID, H3N2 subclade-K is driving an estimated 90 per cent of cases in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What we saw around September [in Australia] onwards is the H1N1s and B viruses decreased, but we saw an increase in H3N2 viruses," Reading said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;How can I avoid catching the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"People who are unwell should consider testing and should avoid mixing with other people as much as possible," Bennett said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Keep homes well-ventilated, hold gatherings outdoor if possible, and wear a mask in busy public indoor spaces if susceptible to more severe respiratory infections."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NSW Health advises getting the annual flu vaccine, as well as practising good hand hygiene — including handwashing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SBS Australia</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:13:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQLXl5ZzdBT2hYWkVncFVCanlhVEw4M25RRHYwYnlWNDZvRjlxS1B6TUxoc2NyZUFnOWwzM0lRZEotYjdCdjFFbHowRlFfOXVtazJ0LXVuenZLWUFJeDJUdDZPcGFFV1cyYjhIZWJCc24tVzBzUktPT0NYY0MtZWRCN0JOUGxtVUJCQ1UycW55VE9MUlNrVWozV2lsMTlkUQ</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州确认2026年首例麻疹病例，公众敦促审查疫苗接种- KATU</title><link>https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-confirms-first-measles-cases-of-2026-public-urged-to-review-vaccinations-rfk-jr-hhs-us-donald-trump-disease-cdc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;LINN COUNTY, Ore. (KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;Health officials in Oregon have confirmed the state's first measles cases of 2026, with two people diagnosed in Linn County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Linn County public health officials are investigating the cases and have identified two locations where the public may have been exposed to the virus: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lebanon Community Hospital Emergency Department on Jan. 6 from 8:53 p.m. to 7 a.m. on Jan. 7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Albany General Hospital Emergency Department on Jan. 7 from 4:59 a.m. to 8:15 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Howard Chiou, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at OHA’s Public Health Division, emphasized the importance of vaccination, stating, "Measles is here in Oregon and rates are increasing nationally, which is why we encourage everyone to make sure they’re protected by talking with their providers about being up to date on vaccinations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oregon's 2025 cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon's&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-confirms-first-measles-case-of-2025-in-multnomah-county-cdc-washington-disease-vaccination-health-authority-sickness-illness-infection-rash-symptoms-unvaccinated" target="_blank"&gt; first measles case in 2025 &lt;/a&gt;was confirmed in June, when a person was hospitalized in the Portland area with a rash and conjunctivitis after they contracted the disease during international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May, the OHA reported that Oregon had a record-high nonmedical vaccine exemption for kindergartners, but most families continued to vaccinate their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonMeaslesImmunizationData/StateRates" target="_blank"&gt;record &lt;/a&gt;9.7% of kindergartners in the state have claimed nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements for the 2024-2025 school year, marking the highest rate ever recorded in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase continues an upward trend from 8.8% in 2024, when Oregon had the fourth-highest nonmedical exemption rate in the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; United States&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms and 'immune amnesia'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, with the virus lingering for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically start with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, followed by a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"&gt;rash&lt;/a&gt;. Complications can include ear infections, lung infections, and, rarely, brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, and is known to cause a dangerous and unique phenomenon called "&lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;," in which the infected patient's immune system goes through a reset, effectively "forgetting" any immunity it had towards other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to studies, in a room full of people exposed to measles, 90% who are unvaccinated will develop the disease. In addition, it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in healthy people, measles can cause the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioral and intellectual deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise those experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms &lt;/a&gt;not to visit medical offices unannounced. Instead, they should call ahead to arrange a safe entry plan to prevent exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically appear seven to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can be particularly dangerous for infants, young children, adults over 20, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Push for vaccinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March of 2025, U.S. Senators of Oregon &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" target="_blank"&gt;Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley &lt;/a&gt;called on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take immediate action to curb the spread of measles in the United States. The plea followed the first measles-related deaths in the country in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Secretary Kennedy, the senators highlighted the urgency of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Secretary Kennedy chaired the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense from 2015 to 2023, he wrote an&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt; op-ed last year for Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in which he called MMR vaccines "crucial" to avoiding deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles outbreak is call to action for all of us," the op-ed is titled. "Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, with two doses of the MMR vaccine providing 97% protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/us-has-twice-as-many-measles-cases-so-far-this-year-than-in-all-of-2024-04-06-2025" target="_blank"&gt; resurgence of measles&lt;/a&gt; is linked to global spikes in cases, increasing the likelihood of unvaccinated travelers bringing the virus back to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was once a major health threat in the U.S., especially for children, with hundreds of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths annually before the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963 led to a dramatic decline in cases, deaths, and serious complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1981, less than 1% of the previous number of cases were reported, and only 10% of U.S. counties saw any cases at all, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxOUEx4dWhLNGRiU184VDhxUUFYVEJKVEJYeVpBQ3pReDYtWU5WaThCcnhuVXhqdThvY1FfZVpTUkhyYlM0MjdUY04tbFc4TTBUOXA3aVZ6N1lZbUphdFcxUTNUZ2N2M3RNWkM2bS1CLW1yQWxpdEtCYlhfNDZzdG9ORW1GMjA0dU9RdWxQTHVuek5tV214ZWxOQzlnZWpFdUdocmIzTDdIWGhJR3l3dVFZc3VtN0dZMVBIb2QyMGdnMjdlb01QM01YOTJOV0ptVmxpOWdUb0VUM1hTUDNaQXo0</guid></item><item><title>60年代和70年代的7种常见做法今天是非法的（或可耻的） - VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-t-7-common-practices-from-the-60s-and-70s-that-would-be-illegal-or-scandalous-today/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;The 1960s and 70s are often remembered as decades of freedom, rebellion, and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were loud, expressive, and full of cultural shifts that still influence how we live today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they were also surprisingly casual about things we now see as dangerous, unethical, or flat-out unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back isn’t about moral superiority, it’s about noticing how quickly norms change once we understand the consequences of our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you zoom out, it becomes a lesson in psychology more than history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we tolerate says less about right and wrong, and more about what we’ve collectively agreed not to question yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven everyday practices from that era that would never make it past today’s laws or social standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Smoking everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to overstate how normal smoking once was. Cigarettes weren’t just common, they were embedded into the physical design of public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could smoke on airplanes, in offices, in restaurants, and in hospital waiting rooms. Ashtrays were built into desks and armrests, and nobody thought twice about lighting up indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s striking is that the issue wasn’t just people choosing to smoke. It was everyone else being forced to participate whether they wanted to or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10644-secondhand-smoke-dangers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Secondhand smoke&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t widely discussed, and the idea that it could seriously harm others hadn’t yet entered the mainstream conversation. If you didn’t like it, that was your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-bt-9-things-boomers-did-in-their-30s-that-would-get-someone-fired-arrested-or-divorced-today/"&gt;smoking indoors&lt;/a&gt; in most public places is illegal, and socially it’s often frowned upon even outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift feels obvious now, but at the time it required a complete reframing of what personal choice actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of how cultural blindness works. When a behavior is everywhere, it fades into the background and stops registering as harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Corporal punishment in schools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when physical punishment in schools wasn’t controversial. It was policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers openly hit students with paddles, rulers, or straps as a form of discipline. Parents often supported it, believing it built character and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we now understand about child psychology tells a very different story. Fear may produce compliance, but it also produces &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, shame, and long-term stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most schools today ban &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-you-survived-these-9-parenting-styles-from-the-70s-youre-either-incredibly-resilient-or-deeply-traumatized/"&gt;corporal punishment&lt;/a&gt; outright, and where it still exists, it’s heavily criticized. The idea of striking a child in the name of education now feels deeply unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s uncomfortable is realizing how confident adults once were that this was the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authority plus tradition created a shield that protected the practice from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a reminder that just because something is common doesn’t mean it’s healthy, especially when the people affected have no voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Drinking and driving as a social norm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 60s and early 70s, drunk driving wasn’t treated as a serious crime. It was often brushed off as bad judgment or even a funny story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies played it for laughs, and police responses were inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, officers would simply follow a driver home to make sure they got there safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that you should not drive after drinking simply hadn’t solidified yet. Alcohol and cars coexisted with little friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, this behavior is both illegal and socially condemned. DUI laws are strict, and public awareness campaigns have made the risks impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed wasn’t just legislation. It was perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once society collectively agreed that drunk driving wasn’t normal or funny, behavior shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-bt-if-youve-ever-said-no-to-these-5-types-of-invites-psychology-says-youre-mentally-stronger-than-most/"&gt;Social pressure&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be just as powerful as legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Casual prescribing of powerful drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-78422" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical culture of the 60s and 70s was shockingly relaxed by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors regularly prescribed amphetamines, tranquilizers, and sedatives with minimal oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulants were given to boost productivity. Sedatives were handed out to help people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-lc-7-behaviors-that-seem-normal-but-are-secretly-stress-responses-according-to-psychology/"&gt;cope with stress&lt;/a&gt; or boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was enormous trust in medical authority, and very little emphasis on informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients rarely questioned prescriptions, and doctors rarely explained long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that level of casual prescribing would raise serious red flags. We now require clinical trials, disclosures, and ongoing monitoring for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a decision-making perspective, this shows how power imbalances work. When one side holds all the knowledge, the other side is unlikely to push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows how good intentions can still lead to harm when systems lack accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Workplace behavior with no boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office culture in the 60s and 70s operated under rules that would be unacceptable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual &lt;a href="https://thinkhumanrights.ca/know-your-rights/what-is-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; laws were minimal or nonexistent, and power dynamics were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwanted comments, inappropriate touching, and relationships between bosses and employees were often dismissed as normal office life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints, if they were voiced at all, were rarely taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, much of that behavior would result in immediate disciplinary action or legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift didn’t happen overnight, but it happened once language caught up to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once people had words for harassment and coercion, they could finally name what felt wrong. And once something is named, it becomes much harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, this matters because &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-8-signs-youre-intelligent-enough-to-see-problems-everywhere-but-not-emotionally-equipped-to-enjoy-anything/"&gt;naming a problem&lt;/a&gt; is often the first step toward dismantling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Children roaming freely without supervision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people feel nostalgic about how free childhood once was. In the 60s and 70s, kids often left the house in the morning and came back at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played far from home, rode public transportation alone, and sometimes hitchhiked. Parents trusted that things would work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that level of freedom would likely trigger concern or even legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents can now be accused of negligence for situations that were once routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perception of risk has shifted dramatically. We are far more aware of worst-case scenarios, and that awareness shapes how we parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an ongoing debate about whether we’ve &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-8-quiet-behaviors-that-suggest-you-dont-trust-easily-no-matter-what-you-say/"&gt;become too cautious&lt;/a&gt;. But regardless of where you land, the contrast between eras is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows how fear and safety evolve alongside information, media, and cultural narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Advertising that openly manipulated or lied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising in the 60s and 70s played fast and loose with the truth. Cigarettes were marketed as healthy, and sugary foods were framed as essential to a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender stereotypes were blatant, and &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-8-signs-someone-is-emotionally-manipulative-but-doesnt-realize-it-according-to-psychology/"&gt;emotional manipulation&lt;/a&gt; was unapologetic. Regulations were limited, and accountability was rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, advertising laws are stricter, and consumers are more skeptical. Companies are still persuasive, but outright false claims are more likely to be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really changed was media literacy. People slowly learned how persuasion works and how easily emotions can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand framing and repetition, you don’t consume messages the same way. That awareness has forced brands to evolve, even if reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the 60s and 70s isn’t about shaming the past. It’s about understanding how flexible our sense of normal really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels obvious today once required decades of debate, research, and resistance. And what feels acceptable now may one day be questioned just as intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real takeaway is simple. Staying curious and willing to reexamine our assumptions is one of the most practical skills we can develop.&lt;/p&gt;

counted 23,548 residents aged 100 or older on January 1, 2025, and almost 83% were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mix lets researchers test whether one ancient lineage shows up more often in people who reach extreme old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity studies work best when scientists define the outcome clearly, because vague age cutoffs blur genetic signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited centenarians, people who reach age 100 or more, and compared their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dna-extracted-from-ancient-egyptian-skeleton-is-genetic-mixture-of-two-distinct-worlds/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; with younger adults from similar regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strict focus reduces noise from normal aging, but it cannot remove differences in childhood hardship, work, or pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-historical-genomes"&gt;Comparing historical genomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New lab methods now recover usable DNA from old bones, letting scientists compare past people with living genomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers use paleogenomics, which is genome research using DNA from ancient remains, to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954285/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;compare&lt;/a&gt; prehistoric genomes with modern ones and map population history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient samples remain scarce, so any link between an old lineage and long life must be tested again elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-western-hunter-gatherers"&gt;Western Hunter-Gatherers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Hunter-Gatherers, Ice Age Europeans living before farming, left DNA that still appears in many people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4943878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; describes the Villabruna cluster in Italy about 14,000 years ago, tied to this ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The label marks a genetic pattern, not a named tribe, and it cannot trace any one person’s family story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns across the genome let scientists estimate how much ancestry comes from different ancient sources within one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancestry study modeled each participant’s DNA as a blend of four components, including farmers, steppe herders, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-population-discovered-latnija-malta-crossing-sea-no-outside-contact-with-world/"&gt;hunter-gatherers&lt;/a&gt;, and Iranian-Caucasus groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These estimates carry uncertainty, and small differences may reflect geography or sampling, so researchers used several tests for confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hunter-gatherer-dna-and-longevity"&gt;Hunter-gatherer DNA and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across multiple analyses, centenarians showed a stronger pull toward Western Hunter-Gatherer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/science-revives-the-face-of-a-hunter-gatherer-mosanne-from-10500-years-ago/"&gt;ancestry&lt;/a&gt; than the younger comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancestry study analyzed 333 centenarians and 690 controls, compared them with 103 genomes, and linked this ancestry to 38% higher odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the present study, we demonstrate the contribution of ancient genetic components to the longevity phenotype.” wrote Prof. Giuliani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome scans can spot where inherited segments cluster, revealing whether certain DNA changes track with extreme age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/superagers-have-brains-that-dont-seem-to-age-now-scientists-say-they-know-why/"&gt;Centenarians&lt;/a&gt; carried more Western Hunter-Gatherer variants, small DNA changes that can alter protein signals, at several longevity-linked spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern suggests specific biology matters, but only lab experiments can show how these variants influence metabolism, immunity, or repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-and-harsh-winters"&gt;Women and harsh winters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women often outnumber men among people who reach 100, and the ancestry study saw the effect most clearly there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smaller male sample limits power, so researchers could not test whether the same pattern holds for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future datasets with more long-lived men could confirm whether this signal reflects biology, history, or simple sampling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh winters and scarce food once rewarded bodies that stored energy well and fought infections quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest peak of the last Ice Age, some immune and metabolism variants may have aided survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same changes might now support healthier aging, yet modern diets and medicine differ greatly from Ice Age pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inflammation-and-aging-risks"&gt;Inflammation and aging risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging often brings low-grade inflammation that damages tissues, raising the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this inflammaging, long-lasting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; activation that rises with age, and it can speed cellular wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Western Hunter-Gatherer variants dampen that process, they could help later-life health, but any tradeoff needs direct tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-longevity-and-human-aging"&gt;DNA, longevity, and human aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human longevity involves many biological pathways, linked steps that control cell maintenance and stress responses, not a single gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37941149/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; notes that only five main pathways have been consistently linked to longevity in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancestry signal may point to one of those pathways, but no one should treat ancestry alone as a forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancestry research can mislead when hidden factors move with genetics, especially in countries with strong regional structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A confounder, a hidden factor that distorts a result, could be local diet, income, or healthcare tied to region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancestry study adjusted for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rare-genetic-mutation-has-given-rise-to-a-new-blood-group-mal-system/"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; structure, but it still cannot prove cause and effect without deeper biological follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the ancestry study links deep European history to modern aging, using ancient genomes to spotlight a longevity-related signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can now test whether those inherited variants change immune balance or energy use, while keeping lifestyle advice firmly separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;
