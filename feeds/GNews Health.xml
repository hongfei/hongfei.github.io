According to Amati, this life stage is when we finish building bones and muscle, and start spending hours studying, working, and socialising – all of which increase nutrient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Adolescence and early adulthood are another big window of opportunity for nutrition," says Amati. "In the 20s, growth slows, but it's still a crucial decade for establishing habits that protect heart and brain health in later life. We see that a lot of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/lifestyle-pattern-during-adolescence-is-associated-with-cardiovascular-risk-markers-in-young-adults-results-from-the-donald-cohort-study/C26C70796BF74B030C5937314CF51725" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;groundwork for cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; is already being laid in this age group, even though symptoms appear much later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188(05)00121-X/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;our teens, the body needs more of several nutrients&lt;/a&gt; compared to later adulthood. This includes calcium, vitamin D and iron – which is especially important for those who menstruate. Protein and B vitamins are also important, Amati says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what does this diet look like? According to Amati, teens and young adults should follow a largely plant-based diet and avoid ultra-processed foods. So lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, beans, nuts, lentils and seeds. It's also important to have an adequate amount of protein for every meal, which can also be plant-based, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Studies show that following such a diet doesn't just benefit the body, it can impact mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNekdXSDcwWUY5NzFxbnQ5NVhGWEtPelFobDIxWW1aWkN6R3JCcFFRcW10eTlGS2dPb0UzbWlHWlNmaHhMMWxVM3YzcWlPSUh4NVBaLW1iSWRBM0FKbGxtc0tGYnBNeGk5S29yNXFxM21PN2IxWjFrMkVSQWNEcUlpWTdpemlsNW1XUEhpcEc0LXhyZ1dIV2UxUExXeGRqUUJ3</guid></item><item><title>拥有“黄金之心”的21岁爱达荷州男子在意外死亡后继续祝福他人- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51435967/21-year-old-idaho-man-who-had-a-heart-of-gold-continues-to-bless-others-after-unexpected-death</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIGBY — A Rigby man, remembered for the selfless life he lived, was able to bless others through organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noel Rios, who went by the name Titus Freeman, died on the evening of Oct. 19, 2025, at the age of 21. He was riding his dirt bike — he's been riding since he was 3 years old — when he was involved in a crash with a truck half a mile from his home in Rigby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was most likely killed on impact," Janice Bell, who is Freeman's aunt, told EastIdahoNews.com. "He had a helmet and all his riding gear on, and it didn't save him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 13, just days before the accident, Freeman turned 21. Bell said her nephew's best friend, who is in his late 60s, told him he needed to get a "big boy license" since he was now 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He took Friday off to go get his new driver's license … and he thought to himself (and told his mom), 'I'm an adult now, I should be a donor.' He wasn't a donor before," Bell explained. "When he went down there (to renew his license), he became a donor. That was Friday, and he was killed Sunday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the accident, Freeman was rushed to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where his family was told he wouldn't survive. The hospital found out he was a donor, and he was taken to the intensive care unit and put on life support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A donor honor walk took place Oct. 22, where Freeman, who had been declared brain dead, was wheeled down to the operating room as family, friends, coworkers and hospital employees lined the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Freeman's decision to become a donor, he helped save the lives of seven other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His heart went to another 21-year-old boy in Utah," said Bell, who said she hopes that person goes on to "do great things." "We don't know much about his other ones (like) his kidneys and lungs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Titus Freeman in the hospital. Freeman died after a dirt bike crash in October, but was able to save seven lives through organ donation. (Photo: Freeman family)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman not only helped others as a donor, but also by giving freely and serving those around him, which he did throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman worked for Knife River in Idaho Falls at the time of his death. Bell mentioned that he led a crew of men twice his age, and he'd get to work at 5 a.m. to start everybody's machines so they'd be warm for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He gave his whole crew lunch money (and gas money) all the time," she said. "When he passed away, they all paid him back in his front loader (that) was his machine. It was full of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman, who was born in Caldwell, has one older and one younger sister. Bell said Freeman had a challenging childhood, but he rose above it. At 19, he decided to buy a house in Rigby for his mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She not only loved him — every parent has a favorite, I don't care what they say. If they say they don't, they lie — but Titus, the reason he was her favorite is he also loved her the most," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman was a gifted baseball player who enjoyed playing disc golf and going fishing. When he was 12, he rebuilt a snowmobile, and most recently, he was rebuilding the engine in his truck. He got his truck running the day of his accident, but he never got a chance to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was such a good boy. Never in trouble in his life," Bell recalled. "He didn't go out drinking. He was in bed by 8 or 9. We call him the old man of the family. He was an anomaly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said losing her nephew was "the worst thing possible," but she is proud of the lives he was able to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to be religious, or you can be, but God — if there is a God — he did this. This must have been part of his plan … of some plan," she said. "I guess he had a plan for my beautiful, sweet nephew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman will be honored in Utah this summer when his name is added to the Celebration of Life Monument. The monument is a memorial and tribute to people both living and deceased who have donated organs, tissue, and eyes for either transplant or research in the Intermountain area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Most men don’t notice anything at first because early prostate cancer often doesn’t cause obvious symptoms. It quietly grows, sometimes for years, before it becomes big enough to bother you. And that’s part of the reason it can sneak up on people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer ranks as the third leading cancer site among males in India, following lung cancer and mouth cancer. Globally, about 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed every year, and those numbers are expected to rise as populations age. A 2024 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/indianjurol/fulltext/2024/07000/descriptive_epidemiology_of_prostate_cancer_in.7.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that “Prostate cancer incidence showed a rise after the age of 50, with a notable acceleration after age 64. The overall annual percentage change for prostate cancer incidence from 1982 to 2016 was 2.6. Around 43.0% of all prostate cancers were diagnosed at the distant metastatic stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d think that when something is becoming more common, people would talk about it more. But that isn’t really the case with prostate cancer in India. Even though prostate cancer is one of the cancers men get most often, a lot of guys either haven’t heard of it or don’t take it seriously until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big reason is that early signs don’t scream “something’s wrong.” Frequent peeing at night or a weak stream, most men just shrug it off as “just aging” or chalk it up to an enlarged prostate (which lots of older men get). The subtlety of symptoms means many folks don’t even think, maybe I should check this out with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the whole talk-about-it problem. In many Indian families, men aren’t used to chatting about urinary issues or anything that feels “private.” Shame or embarrassment kicks in, doctors don’t get a call, and the awareness just stays low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232704210_Awareness_Regarding_Risk_Factors_Symptoms_and_Treatment_Facilities_for_Cancer_in_Selected_States_of_India" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also show that general knowledge about cancers not linked to tobacco, prostate for instance, is very low in many parts of India. Most people might have heard the name but can’t really say what it is, what the risk factors are, or why early detection matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prostate cancer: Common symptoms that get missed easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms at first.

These include a weak urinary stream, not emptying your bladder (urinary retention) and waking up more than 2 times per night to urinate (nocturia). The symptoms of BPH typically progress slowly over time. Prostate Cancer may present in similar ways during early stages but is typically detected by the following signs: blood in urine/sperm, persistent bone or back pain, sudden/unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and rapidly increasing symptoms rather than slow progression over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I wake up several times at night to urinate—how do I know if it’s just age or something serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for men to experience nocturia while they age, and waking up one to two times is considered normal, especially if it is an occasional occurrence. However, increased concern arises if the pattern becomes frequent enough (more than two to three times each night), appears suddenly or increases in severity and if any additional symptom accompanies it, weak urine stream, urinary retention, or blood in urine. Therefore, if the issues of nocturia and/or waking frequently at night are noticed, they should be evaluated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should I see a doctor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a person sees blood in their urine, semen, experiences unexplained weight loss or fatigue, they should contact their physician. Symptoms such as blood, new or increasing urinary symptoms, weak or interrupted stream of urine, or continuing pain in lower back, hips, and/or pelvis are an indication for consulting their physician. Additionally, symptoms disrupting sleep or work would also warrant a visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should men over 40 get checked for prostate issues, even if they feel fine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most physicians will begin routine screening for prostate cancer based on family history when the man reaches 50 years old, while those with a family history of prostate cancer may begin screening at an earlier age, between 40 and 45 years of age. A standard screening for prostate cancer consists of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and a digital rectal examination (DRE). Depending on what the initial PSA test results indicate and how risk factors (family history, ethnicity, etc.) for the individual, the possible frequency of screenings are from once a year to every 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If I have a family history of prostate cancer, how can I tell if minor symptoms are a warning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family history has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, so even mild changes in urinary function should be evaluated by a doctor. During the evaluation, even though the initial thought may be that such changes are due to normal aging or BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia) it is important not to discount them as such. The earlier a person discusses any concerns with their doctor, has a PSA test performed, and follows up regularly, the greater the likelihood that prostate cancer will be detected early enough to allow for successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer doesn’t always announce itself loudly. When symptoms look like “normal aging,” it’s easy to ignore them. Doctors stress that paying attention to changes, and talking about them early, can make the difference between a cancer that’s treatable and one that’s already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>另一名弗吉尼亚州儿童在国外旅行后患上麻疹-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/01/20/measles-virginia-child-travel-contagious/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G7KH5SE2MVD5LHD3A6IYUKV37M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A week after reporting &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/01/12/virginia-child-measles-dc-maryland-exposure/" target="_blank"&gt;a child with measles&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the region while contagious, Virginia public health officials on Tuesday reported the case of another young child with the illness and warned of possible public exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:52:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNclZheUVTMUJ4Y0gzNHZqTmVMcEItSk11eDU0RGNyV2U5Tm10WXZjTVFINmhWVy1FYXVZRXVBRS1wQ2tYM1hINkNNNGp3LWhjOUhIX2k2c1d4ejZjRkNzNTg3YzBZam5hb3Y1dG9JQnB5bTJidEpVRXZtQk1fR3AxRzY3Wi0zNzhaQlBZSjJGbDU5cXRGS1Jv</guid></item><item><title>为什么混合运动可能是延长寿命的关键- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0y9pqe2zro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Why doing a mix of exercise could be the key to longer life&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-3adb3607-0 fkltMW"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-3adb3607-12 csUdlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-3adb3607-5 iMnQuR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-3adb3607-7 echTHp"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-3adb3607-8 dcphMW"&gt;Philippa Roxby and Joe McFadden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-3adb3607-9 dRohlg"&gt;Health reporters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A young woman wearing black leggings and a sleeveless top, with dark hair tied up, pulls hard on a tug-of-war rope in a gym with a grey floor.

Examples are running, swimming, football, hockey, gymnastics or walking up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Exercises which strengthen the muscles include yoga, lifting weights, tai chi, sit-ups, energetic gardening and carrying heavy shopping bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For the research, more than 70,000 nurses aged 30-55 and 40,000 health professionals aged 40-75 were asked to provide information on activities they did every week, like walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, rowing, tennis and squash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They filled in questionnaires every two years, and included how much weight training exercise they did, we well as lower intensity exercise like yoga, and other activities such as gardening and climbing stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After crunching the numbers, the researchers found that most individual types of exercise reduced the risk of death from any cause. But people who took part in the widest mix of activities fared even better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Their risk of death from cancer, heart disease, lung illnesses and other causes was 13-41% lower than other people's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The research also found six hours of moderate activity or three hours of vigorous exercise was the optimum amount of exercise each week, after which the benefits levelled off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Although the study is large and physical activity was measured repeatedly, the research does have limitations.

            Ongoing measles outbreaks in multiple parts of the country are threatening the United States’ status as a nation that has eliminated the virus’ spread, but a CDC leader said Tuesday that the potential change is not a big concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Tuesday’s briefing was federal officials’ first on a continuing South Carolina outbreak that has totaled at least 646 cases, according to the state’s health department. There were roughly 760 cases in the West Texas outbreak&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;last year, making it one of the largest and deadliest measles outbreaks that the US has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

But he also said that the US losing elimination status would not be a grave concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000c3b6suqnc97am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Losing elimination status … does not mean that the measles would be widespread, nor would it alter any key measles elimination strategies,” said Abraham, who joined CDC this month. He added that “vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles” but that he supports personal freedom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Asked during the briefing whether he would see that as a significant loss, Abraham said, “not really.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000f3b6s2rpklxsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000g3b6suq6s7v5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He added that the CDC’s role is to support those communities and help minimize effects of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000h3b6simnp023b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The message that I certainly want to send as the deputy director here is, we’re open for business. We’re here to help, we understand concerns that those communities may have, and we’re willing to listen to alternatives” for treatment and prevention, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Ninety-three percent of cases recorded in the US last year, and 95% so far in 2026, had not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or had an unknown vaccination status, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000j3b6sacdxhiy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina’s outbreak, centered in the upstate region, is quickly on track to outpace last year’s outbreak in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000k3b6sms3bcjju@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the hundreds of confirmed cases, more than 500 people in South Carolina are in quarantine after they were exposed to a known measles case without the protection of vaccination, the state health department said, and more cases are expected to come from that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000l3b6srcea4xh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated students are in quarantine after exposures in more than a dozen schools — including elementary, middle and high schools. Exposures were also identified at Clemson University and Anderson University, both in the upstate region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000m3b6sonim9e8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who resigned in protest last year, said in another briefing Tuesday that trends suggest that the measles outbreak in South Carolina is “very, very active.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000n3b6si46ddbbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is in a growth phase, and it is in a very aggressively fast growth phase,” he said. “We are nowhere close to the place that we would need to be able to say that this is coming under control.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000o3b6s2ebphvq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of measles cases in the South Carolina outbreak  — nearly 90% — have been among children, and nearly all have been unvaccinated. Only about 2% of cases have been in people known to have been fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to data from the South Carolina state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000p3b6sso5a4rqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daskalakis, along with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and Dr. Annie Andrews from South Carolina, blamed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for a rising distrust of vaccinations that has allowed measles to spread so rapidly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000q3b6s4s5ru66v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What’s happening today with measles is absolutely public health malpractice, and it’s completely preventable,” said Green, who is also a physician. “It is public health malpractice to have thwarted confidence in vaccinations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000r3b6s54nvwbd6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000s3b6s9iy8pczy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The worst part of it is, is it’s being encouraged by our public health leaders. It’s exactly the wrong thing to do,” Green said. “Let’s be clear: Kids will die.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not really,” said Ralph Abraham, a physician who formerly served as Louisiana’s surgeon general. “You know, it’s just the cost of doing business, with our borders being somewhat porous [and] global and international travel.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A country does not lose measles elimination status by having imported cases of the disease. With the virus circulating globally, such introductions will occur. Elimination status is lost if, after an introduction, a country is unable to stop ongoing transmission of the virus and circulation continues for a year or longer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abraham, who began his tenure at the CDC earlier this month, said that while the agency is helping states quell outbreaks however it can, some transmission is happening within communities where parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children and “that’s their personal freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You know, the president, the [health] secretary, we talk all the time about religious freedom, health freedom, personal freedom, and I think we have to respect those communities that choose to go somewhat of a different route,” Abraham said during a press conference called to discuss the ongoing measles outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As CDC, it is also our responsibility and our goal to support these communities in any way that we can to minimize the effects that measles would have, especially on the pediatric population,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In addition to assisting states, Abraham said he and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been promoting measles vaccination. “We are saying publicly and do believe that the MMR vaccine is a good vaccine to prevent the measles,” he said. (Measles vaccine is administered in a combination vaccine that also protects against mumps and rubella.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine advocates say Kennedy has not been publicly forceful about the importance of vaccination and has fanned anxieties about supposed vaccine risks that scientific evidence has shown to be unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The press conference was held on the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed measles case from the large West Texas outbreak that spread across multiple states and led to three deaths in 2025. As of Jan. 14, a total of 2,242 confirmed measles cases had been reported to the CDC in 2025, the highest single-year total since 1991. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Johns Hopkins University’s &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles tracker&lt;/a&gt; — which posts numbers more quickly than the CDC does — there have already been 336 confirmed cases in 2026. That is more cases in three weeks than the country recorded in most years in the period from 1993 to 2025. The number of measles cases in the U.S. started to decline in the early ’90s, a few years after health officials began recommending two doses of the MMR vaccine instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is currently unclear if some of the  present transmission traces back to the West Texas outbreak. A CDC scientist who also took part in the press conference said the agency is working to generate and study whole genome sequences of viruses from a variety of locations to try to determine if more recent cases signal ongoing spread or were triggered by new introductions of measles virus from abroad. Reporters were told the CDC scientist could not be identified by name as a condition of participating in the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was said to have eliminated measles in 2000, a status that meant the virus was no longer endemic — not spreading in an ongoing fashion — within the country’s borders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canada, which has been in the grips of a large measles outbreak that has spanned most of the country, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/10/measles-canada-americas-paho-who-elimination-status/"&gt;lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Pan American Health Organization announced that its regional verification commission, which is responsible for determining if countries in the region have eliminated measles, will meet on April 13 to study whether the United States and Mexico have lost their elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC scientist noted that the agency is working to compare whole genome sequences of a variety of viruses from across the country to try to determine if spread is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need time to be able to do that comprehensive analysis,” the official said, noting that the agency is working with academic and state labs on a new way of analyzing measles genetic data. “We’ve not had to use whole genome sequencing routinely in the past for measles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firing rates in the motor and somatosensory cortex, on the other hand, looked radically different. This suggests there is a dynamic neural code defined by rapidly changing firing rate relationships amongst the neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks this means that the cingulate cortex manages the social purpose and context of the facial gesture, which is relatively stable. This may be where the brain integrates sensory cues—like the look of another monkey’s expression—with its own internal state to produce the right facial gesture for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic code areas implement this expression by driving individual muscles. “They’re driving the kinematics like ‘move this lip a millimeter to the left, now a millimeter to the right,’” Ianni explains. These constant miniscule movements of muscles are necessary because facial expressions are usually dynamic—macaques’ eyelids, lips, cheeks, and ears are constantly twitching and changing their position even if the end effect looks still from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The journey begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just the beginning of a long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There have been such fabulous, impressive advances in the field of assistive communication devices even since I started this project,” Ianni says, and points to neural prostheses developed by Maitreyee Wairagkar’s team Ars &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-neural-brain-implant-provides-near-instantaneous-speech/"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 as one of the examples. Building a similar neural prosthesis for decoding facial gestures is unlikely to happen overnight, though. We’re a rather long way away from truly restoring the ability to communicate through facial gestures to patients who lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ianni’s study is the first that recorded neurons producing facial gestures with multi-electrode arrays. This means we’ve only just begun to build up base science on the neural mechanism behind making faces. This is the point where neural speech decoding technology was in the late 1990s, and we still can’t make that reliable enough for regular clinical products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ianni remains hopeful. “I hope our work goes towards enabling the field, even the tiniest bit, towards more naturalistic and rich communication designs that will improve lives of patients after brain injury,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="189181d7-60c4-4480-b2d5-e81a672fcd0f"&gt;A 47-year Swedish study published in 2026 can tell us when fitness and strength begin declining — and I’m very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed adults for almost five decades to uncover when physical decline &lt;em&gt;truly &lt;/em&gt;begins. They looked at fitness, strength and muscle endurance, and how this evolves in adulthood. Here’s everything you need to know about the mammoth study and what age your physical fitness really starts to fade out (plus, how to fix it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-531259a1-68cc-4005-8105-23c2f2f7fb5b" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-study-3"&gt;What is the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="4f3894db-c4a3-48c2-a517-a8369aa84f7b"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="08e02e9c-e700-41f6-b451-01e1864c2603"&gt;I came across the study in&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035336.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035336.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;, but it was conducted at the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.ki.se/long-term-study-reveals-physical-ability-peaks-at-age-35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://news.ki.se/long-term-study-reveals-physical-ability-peaks-at-age-35" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s rare for studies to follow people for such a long period, so this offers a unique insight into how the body changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any age, exercise boosts physical ability and slows the inevitable decline in strength and fitness as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2d35bc3a-ca34-4a5d-82f5-133c01f81ddb" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-research-mean-3"&gt;What does the research mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="519c616f-6aaa-4b04-bb01-c272db00599f"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="3cf3d433-344e-4ffb-8a78-3a79790c3afa"&gt;Interestingly, the decline occurred regardless of how well-trained people were before 35. But, post-35, decline continues gradually, says researchers, which then speeds up with advancing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “encouraging evidence” tells us that exercise can slow this process down and help increase physical capacity by 5-10%, which also slows decline in performance, but doesn’t completely prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means it’s never too late to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body"&gt;start a yoga routine&lt;/a&gt;, take up &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner"&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, or even head to your local gym to lift weights.

&lt;p id="d3b386eb-c5a2-42ab-a72e-eb20bda93d05"&gt;Small changes in exercise, sleep and dietary habits could do wonders for people's health and possibly extend their overall lifespan, a large U.K. study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Jan. 13 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sought to find the smallest possible lifestyle improvements that could measurably lengthen people's lifespans. The researchers searched within data collected from almost 60,000 people in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cohort, a repository of medical and lifestyle data from hundreds of thousands of U.K. adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="d3b386eb-c5a2-42ab-a72e-eb20bda93d05-2"&gt;The team linked the participants' documented habits to their theoretical overall longevity and health, as calculated using statistical modelling. They found that people who slept as little as five extra minutes daily, engaged in just two extra minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, and added a half serving of vegetables per day tended to live significantly longer than the worst performers — meaning those whose sleep habits, exercise, and nutrition patterns put them in the bottom 5% of the overall cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="24284f69-459c-4a89-b5d1-263a993cbfcf"&gt;The former group had an extra year of overall lifespan compared with the latter, according to the statistical model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that adding a few minutes of exercise or sleep and making small changes to diet will guarantee an extra year of life, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/stephen-burgess" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/stephen-burgess" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stephen Burgess&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a statistician at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By itself, this study does not prove that these habits improve health," he cautioned. "They model what might happen to our life span if changing these factors does improve health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the data suggested that improvements across several aspects of well-being are "greater than the sum of their parts," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-koemel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-koemel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicholas Koemel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and research fellow at The University of Sydney, told Live Science. For instance, to gain one additional year of lifespan through sleep alone, the study suggested a person would have to sleep an extra 25 minutes per night — a luxury many cannot afford. But very small improvements in sleep, exercise and diet may have a significant combined effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zKdfeaCtxC2MVDRdMiNnph" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zKdfeaCtxC2MVDRdMiNnph slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koemel said the findings suggest that "healthy habits work better as a package."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each one of our behaviors has an interlinking impact on what we do," he said. "If we have a poor night's sleep, we oftentimes eat differently, we move differently. And we see that across all of these different behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the model, the study participants with the most optimal combination of these behaviors — at least 40 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, seven to eight hours of sleep per day, and an overall healthy diet — were predicted to live an extra nine years, overall, and live nine extra years in good health, compared with the poorest 3% of performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By their very design, studies like these, known as cohort studies, need to be taken with a grain of salt. They compare two groups retroactively rather than asking people to change their habits and seeing how that change affects their health. As such, they can never conclusively prove that one particular change caused an associated effect; they can only draw a link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, sleep and exercise habits were measured for only up to a week in the UK Biobank cohort, and the data assume that people kept up those same habits in the long run. Similarly, diet was assessed only at the beginning of the study, rather than monitored over time. So it's possible that the participants changed their habits after these assessments were taken, which would weaken the possibility that their habits improved their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this leaves room for the possibility that it was not these lifestyle differences, but rather some other factor that wasn't measured, that caused the improvement in lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a5ba22b1-000d-4420-a033-cfa5f2452dc1"&gt;It may be, for instance, that one group is wealthier, and it so happens that this makes it easier for that group to exercise, sleep well and eat well. But ultimately, that difference is partially explained by the wealth, not only the behaviors, Burgess explained. It is also possible wealthy people might live in a less polluted area than poorer people, which could contribute to the difference in lifespan. There's no way of telling from this study alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overall message that small changes in these factors are likely to be beneficial is probably correct," Burgess said. "But whether the exact numbers are accurate or not is less clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koemel agreed, saying that more research is needed to confirm the findings. Still, the idea that even tiny changes in lifestyle could have large effects could offer an interesting alternative for those looking to improve their overall well-being, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New Year's resolutions oftentimes fail because we're pushing too hard," he argued. "We're trying to go to the gym every day. We're trying to be perfect." This research suggests there may be a "different path to get from A to Z," by making smaller changes across several areas of well-being that can build up to healthier habits while improving overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="2fe1ecc1-bfc2-4414-bd87-12c99c35e585"&gt;

A shy boy who was bullied in school, he found that liquor helped him to become outgoing and the life of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His drinking escapades, which often resulted in vomiting, were dismissed in his early years as just part of being young. But later, when friends got careers and slipped into adult lives, his close relationship with alcohol continued, and sometimes got out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Charles Knowles, author of Why We Drink, is a professor of surgery at universities in London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles was never focused on how much he drank, although at college he said he could easily sink 15 pints a night. But he found it impossible to stop drinking once he started, and would wake up the next morning craving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There would, however, be periods of abstinence. He said he never drank at, or just before, work, taking his responsibility to patients very seriously. But for at least seven years before his vacation to Florida, he had been trying, and failing, to quit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the book, Knowles described how he was finally able to quit, and detailed the impact alcohol has on our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, he added that he is not against alcohol. Knowles said it had benefitted his life in many ways, including helping him socialize with band mates and meet his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His book comes amid a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15442877/alcohol-dietary-guidelines-consume-less.html"&gt;shift in guidance on alcohol consumption &lt;/a&gt;in the US after federal officials said Americans should 'consume less alcohol for better overall health.' The previous guidelines said men should not consume more than two drinks per day, while women should not consume more than one drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are Knowles's findings on how the drug impacts the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Heart and circulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles, similar to many drinkers, experienced a rapid heart rate while drinking alcohol, an effect triggered when the drug dilates blood vessels and forces the heart to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 17 years on from his last drink, however, he feels he is 'out of the woods' when it comes to suffering the heart health drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have linked drinking to a higher risk of stroke or heart failure. But some say it's not permanent. Research suggests that the heart health risks associated with drinking decline after abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also exacerbate high blood pressure, the most common health condition in the US, by boosting levels of a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there's bad news for those who believe a glass or two of red wine is beneficial: Resveratrol, the compound in red wine once believed to be heart-healthy, is not actually shown to have any benefits, Knowles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have linked drinking to a higher risk of stroke or heart failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Liver and pancreas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a few days of heavy drinking, fats can build up in the liver - the organ that works to filter alcohol out of the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, and if drinking continues, these can cause fatty liver disease, raising the risk of scarring to the liver, which reduces its ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more serious cases, the condition has also been linked to liver cancer and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles underlined, however, that someone would need to consume three alcohol drinks a day to cause these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Stomach and intestines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol consumption can also irritate the stomach lining, causing vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while binge drinking - consuming more than five drinks on the same occasion for men or more than four for women - alcohol can also enter the bowels rapidly and irritate the lining, causing indigestion, constipation and, possibly, incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Obesity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor diet, little exercise and poor sleep can cause obesity, but Knowles warned that drinking alcohol can, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has a high calorie content. A pint of beer contains around 200 calories - the same as a KitKat or two chocolate chip cookies - while a bottle of wine has 700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can disrupt sleep too, causing hunger hormones to go haywire and prompting someone to eat more food the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-8690485/People-drink-just-ONE-bottle-beer-small-wine-day-25-likely-obese.html"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found people who drank a bottle of beer or a small glass of wine every day are up to 25 percent more likely to be obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who drink a bottle of beer or small glass of wine each day are up to 25 percent more likely to be obese, a study of 26 million people found (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1988, the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared alcohol a group 1 carcinogen, putting it on a par with asbestos, radiation and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has now been linked to at least seven cancers. This includes cancer in organs that come into direct contact with alcohol, such as the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus and colon, and those impacted by its effects, including the pancreas, liver and breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12664783/"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt;, the US Surgeon General warned that women who drank two alcoholic beverages per day had a 15 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For colon cancer, which is currently surging among young adults, a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coloncancerfoundation.org/alcohol-destroying-your-liver-and-colon-increasing-your-risk-of-early-crc/"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; warned women who were moderate drinkers - equivalent to one drink per day - had a 47 percent higher risk of colon cancer than those who do not drink. Among men, moderate drinkers had a 26 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Fertility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking has also been linked to problems with male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immediately after drinking, men may struggle to get an erection. The alcohol can disrupt testosterone and cortisol levels in men, which can cause the low libido or erection issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, alcohol can damage sperm production, leading to fewer and lower quality sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew university students who, back in the day, had tried to donate sperm to make some additional money and had failed because of their lifestyle involving alcohol and smoking,' Knowles told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol has been associated with several cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Why We Drink Too Much: The Impact of Alcohol on Our Bodies and Culture by Dr Charles Knowles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Brain and spinal cord&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles warned that alcohol is toxic to nerves and could even shrink the size of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220304090349.htm"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on 36,600 people found that even those drinking relatively modestly, about one or two drinks per day, had reductions in grey matter, used for processing information, and fewer connections in white matter, which allows for communication between different areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it wasn't clear whether this has a serious effect on function. Knowles doesn't believe so, citing his own study that suggests people are still able to function normally even with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did note that there is a risk that drinking large amounts of alcohol could lead to a condition called alcoholic dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He emphasized that this required a lot (three or more drinks per day) of alcohol consumption over the course of at least 40 years. It is not clear exactly how much based on reports, but alcoholic dementia has been detected in homeless communities among those who rely heavily on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drinking, alcohol causes spikes in the feel-good hormones in the brain. But afterward, it causes them to crash, leaving people feeling anxious or depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles struggles with depression himself and takes antidepressants, but said he did not believe his was linked to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said depression runs &lt;span&gt;in his family and that his mood normally was negative (noting that this may have been something that drove him to drink in the first place).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Knowles said that there is a risk that drinking large amounts of alcohol could lead to a condition called alcoholic dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Are there any benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his personal experience with drinking, Knowles insisted that he is not anti-alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you look back on my life, would I change the first 10 years of drinking? No,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I mean, a friend of mine wrote to me, and he said, "think of all the experiences we had." And then listed a number of crazy things that had happened. None of this would have happened without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I mean, I also met my wife drinking, and we have two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I look back, it is difficult because, for many people, alcohol is fun and, provided it is kept in check, it can lead to beneficial outcomes in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why we've been manufacturing alcohol for 15,000 years and continue to consume it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Why We Drink Too Much: The Impact of Alcohol on Our Bodies and Culture by Dr Charles Knowles is published by Celadon Books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;South Carolina's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/south-carolina-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-as-cases-rise-in-the-state/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; continues to grow, with officials on Tuesday announcing an additional 88 cases in the state. There have been 646 cases of measles reported there since October, according to the &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-88-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-646" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;South Carolina Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of measles cases in the United States has led to concern that the U.S. will lose its &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-risks-losing-measles-elimination-status-for-first-time-in-over-2-decades/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A country is considered as having eliminated measles if there are "no locally transmitted measles infections or outbreaks lasting 12 months or longer," according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina outbreak is centered around Spartanburg County. Recent public exposure locations include multiple schools, a Publix supermarket and the South Carolina State Museum, according to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of the cases [are] occurring in the under-vaccinated, close-knit community in the Spartanburg area," Dr. Ralph Lee Abraham, the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a phone briefing. He said the CDC "continues to investigate transmission patterns and is working closely with South Carolina health officials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. In some cases, it can cause severe infections that lead to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hospitalization and death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and health officials say the measles vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination MMR vaccine in childhood, is highly effective and safe. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccination-rates-us-counties-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vaccination rates for measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have dropped in recent years, with many areas falling below the herd immunity threshold experts say is necessary to keep the disease from circulating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the United States saw over 2,240 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — the most in 30 years, according to the CDC. Many of those cases were connected to an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-texas-trump-administration-cdc-response/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Jan. 13, the U.S. has recorded 171 measles nationwide in 2026, the CDC said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;agency plans&lt;/a&gt; to release new numbers for measles cases on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have faith that we're in a place where we can say that we're handling measles very well. Texas was an example. South Carolina is now the new example," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former leader of immunization and respiratory disease strategy at the CDC. "South Carolina is another example of what we see when there's low vaccination rates and a public health system that's not really able to robustly address what's happening." &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles elimination status at risk  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization, the regional office for the World Health Organization in the Americas, will meet in April to review measles elimination status for the United States and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada lost its measles elimination status in November, 27 years after it was considered eliminated in that country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. officially eliminated measles in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles elimination status is a milestone for a country," Daskalakis said. "It indicates that its public health system is healthy and able to respond to measles, which is the most infectious virus that we know. If you can handle measles, the implication is that you have the infrastructure to be able to handle a lot of other infectious diseases as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis said he was skeptical that the U.S. will maintain its elimination status in 2026, which could open the door for further outbreaks of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-vaccine-mandates-united-states-measles-polio-mmr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously eliminated or rare diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this is our vital sign, we're in the ICU," he said. "The future could be that we are going to be looking at measles becoming part of every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Staying safe amid measles outbreaks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing a person can do to prevent getting the measles is get vaccinated, Daskalakis said. One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles. The complete two-dose series is 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond getting vaccinated, people should follow recommendations from public health officials, stay home if they are feeling unwell and stay away from people who have the measles to prevent further transmission of the disease, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in an area where measles is prevalent and you have symptoms, seek medical attention, Daskalakis said. Early signs of measles include a cough, fever and runny nose, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Always talk to your doctor," Daskalakis said. "This is what they live for: Preventing preventable disease." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Last week, we broke down a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-rfk-africa-vaccines"&gt;major debacle&lt;/a&gt; unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to the trial protocols, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the &lt;a href="https://arkansasworker.com/racism-imperialism-and-medical-practices-the-tuskegee-and-guatemalan-syphilis-studies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “It is wretched.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;At the time of our writing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; had reported&lt;/a&gt; that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2021/on-background-is-common-journalism-lingo-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;no such arrangement&lt;/a&gt; — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200430225749/https://africacdc.org/about-us/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;official health agency&lt;/a&gt; of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-coming-of-age-of-the-africa-centers-for-disease-control/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 testing hub&lt;/a&gt; for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11474706/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/joint-press-release-vaccine-doses-allocated-to-9-african-countries-hardest-hit-by-mpox-surge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/ethiopia/news/who-and-africa-cdc-consolidate-ties-advance-public-health-africa" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;collaboration agreement&lt;/a&gt; to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a &lt;a href="https://ask.un.org/faq/140935" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specialized agency&lt;/a&gt; of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to remember your first birthday party. You can probably conjure up a vague image based on a photograph your parents showed you a thousand times. That mental image is most likely false. The truth is that most people barely remember anything before their 3rd birthday. It’s a phenomenon called infantile amnesia, and it’s one of the great paradoxes of being human. We spend our early years soaking up information like sponges, yet our brains seem determined to hit the “delete” button on almost all of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a long time, neuroscientists treated this forgetting as a cognitive glitch or a simple lack of brainware maturity. But a new study suggests that infantile amnesia is actually a feature, not a bug—and it’s being run by an unexpected crew of cellular janitors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out that microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, might be actively scrubbing away our earliest memories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically think of the immune system as our body’s defense force, hunting down pathogens and clearing out debris. But in the brain, immune cells have a day job that looks a lot more like IT management. Microglia are specialized macrophages that account for about 10-15% of cells found within the brain. During the rapid development of infancy, they are busy pruning synapses—the connections between neurons—to refine brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Trinity College Dublin wanted to know if this pruning process was responsible for the loss of early memories. They worked with infant mice, which, like humans, naturally forget fearful experiences they learned as babies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Erika Stewart and Tomás Ryan, trained 17-day-old mice to associate a specific box with a mild foot shock. Under normal conditions, these mice would forget this scary experience by the time they were 25 days old. Essentially, they would grow out of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when the scientists fed the mice minocycline—an antibiotic that inhibits microglial activity—something remarkable happened. The mice didn’t forget. Even eight days later, a lifetime in mouse infancy, the treated mice froze in fear when placed back in the box. By telling the immune system to take a break, the researchers had effectively stopped infantile amnesia in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glowing-traces-of-the-past"&gt;Glowing Traces of the Past&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prove that the memories were physically still there, the team used a technique called genetic “tagging” to make the specific neurons holding the memory—known as &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/memories-stored-in-specific-brain-cells-22032012/"&gt;“engrams”&lt;/a&gt;—glow with a fluorescent protein (EYFP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ml-form-align-center"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ml-form-embedWrapper embedForm"&gt;
            
            &lt;div class="zme-signup-container" id="zme-main-container"&gt;
                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Thank you! One more thing...&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;This allowed them to literally see the memory trace in the brain. They focused on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a hub for context memory, and the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the mice with active microglia (the ones that forgot), the memory engrams were less active during recall. But in the mice treated with the inhibitor, the memory engrams in the amygdala lit up with activity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The memory files hadn’t been corrupted; they had just been protected from the shredder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked closer at the cellular level, they saw that inhibiting the microglia changed how these immune cells interacted with the memory neurons. In the treated mice, there were fewer contact points between the microglia and the engram cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Essentially, by keeping the “memory managers” at arm’s length, the memory was preserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, can be considered the ‘memory managers’ in the brain. Our paper highlights their role in infantile amnesia specifically, and indicates that common mechanisms may exist between infantile amnesia and other forms of forgetting – both in everyday life and in disease,” explained Dr. Stewart, now a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-autism-connection"&gt;The Autism Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t stop at just blocking forgetting. The researchers also looked at the flip side: what happens when the brain’s immune system is primed too early?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a known link between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental conditions like autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). In previous work, this same team discovered that male mouse offspring born to mothers with activated immune systems (a model called MIA, or maternal immune activation) don’t experience infantile amnesia. They remember things they should forget. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this new study, they found that these MIA mice had microglia that looked “blunted,” with reduced phagocytic (eating) activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was as if their cellular janitors were on strike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the twist: When the researchers gave these MIA mice minocycline very early in life (from birth to day 14), it seemingly “reset” their microglia. The treatment restored their ability to forget. It suggests that for the brain to develop typical forgetting patterns, the immune system needs to be functioning within a “Goldilocks” zone—not too active, but not too dormant either. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-feature-not-a-bug"&gt;A Feature, Not a Bug&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why would evolution design a brain that deletes its own data? Senior author Prof. Tomás Ryan suggests that forgetting is a crucial part of how we learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infantile amnesia is possibly the most ubiquitous form of memory loss in the human population,” Ryan notes. “Most of us remember nothing from our early years of life, despite having so many novel experiences during these formative years. This is an overlooked topic in memory research, precisely because we all accept it as a fact of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ryan adds, “But what if those memories are still present in the brain? Increasingly, the memory field views forgetting as a ‘feature’ of the brain rather than a ‘bug’. It seems that the brain is filing away the neuronal units that store memory, the engrams, for later use. Microglia seem to be functioning in the brain to help organise how engrams are stored and expressed across the lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications here are huge. If we can chemically toggle the ability to access early memories in mice, we are one step closer to understanding how memory persistence works in humans. It also raises fascinating questions about neurodiversity. Ryan notes, “It will be interesting and important to identify humans that don’t experience infantile amnesia. To learn how their brains work, and understand their experience of early childhood education.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, if you can’t remember your second birthday, don’t worry. It just means your microglia were doing their job, diligently sculpting your brain to be ready for the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But the label has been enthusiastically adopted by conservative, right-leaning women across the country. Crunchy content of today is more likely to feature calls to prayer, protecting arms and patriotism than to progressivism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/2026/01/20/crunchy-moms-maha-photos/88266029007/" data-t-l="⚑g:l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - 'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_i_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="18"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_rightArrow"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" aria-label="Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio. See a day in their life."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And one topic, more than any other, has come to define the new crunchy moms movement: vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the crunchy moms movement swells, it is emblematic of an increasingly mainstream embrace of vaccine skepticism and a broader lack of trust in established medical science that is alarming scientists and experts in public health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and author of “The Deadly Rise of Anti Science,” decries what he calls a convergence of “snake oil salesmen” from the health and wellness industry with the Trump Administration and Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement. This alliance, Hotez says, is wreaking immeasurable damage to Americans’ trust in science and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rate of diseases once considered essentially under control, if not eradicated, has been climbing in recent years in the United States as vaccine rates have fallen. Measles, for example, has reached its &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2026/01/07/us-sees-highest-measles-case-count-in-decades-as-outbreaks-grow/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;highest rate of infection in decades&lt;/a&gt;, as outbreaks sicken and kill children across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activism is now a leading lethal force in the United States,” Hotez said. “And now it’s spilling over into childhood immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A movement builds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Within the crunchy moms are women who say they or their children have suffered legitimate harm from vaccines. But also flocking to the movement, and in far greater numbers, are women who question everything from the established benefits of vaccines, to how they are approved and tested, to their reported side effects, without their own personal experiences of harm resulting from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio just outside Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Homeschool lessons are given at the LoConti residence, Oct. 14, 2025, in Westlake, Ohio.

Bright says childhood vaccines made her daughter sick, pushing her towards “alternative” research on the vaccine industry. LoConti’s children never suffered such a fate, but nevertheless she’s been pulled in by Bright’s experiences, and stories from moms like her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Over several interviews, Bright and LoConti spoke passionately about the research they have conducted into everything from seed oils to colloidal silver, to double-blind placebo-controlled trials for vaccines. They laid out their reasoning for not trusting vaccines specifically, and the medical and pharmaceutical industries more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For us, it's hard to know who to trust because everything's so intertwined and there's so much money and there's so much behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's nobody asking these questions until now,” LoConti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's a sentiment echoed from the very top of the American government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perhaps the most well-known critic of vaccines, &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-autotag="1eef402e-8d6b-4ca9-ae4b-46a1674522c3" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F.

It started with carefully reading the labels on the products they had long enjoyed, from cereals, to cookies, to milk.

Today’s crunchy universe has its own lexicon, myriad complicated theories and counter-theories, and a legion of skeptics and soothsayers, many with scientific or pseudoscientific backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I look back at the food that I used to feed my teenagers and I'm like, ‘Oh my gosh, I would never feed that to my child now,’” Bright said. “And the amount of moms that reach out to us on social media when we talk about this that are like, ‘I had no clue those ingredients that were in this food I was buying for my kids.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the moms investigated the products they and their children were putting in their bodies, their research quickly took them into the subculture of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine research and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That world was primed to receive crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;‘Just asking questions’ about vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For decades before Bright and LoConti found it, the anti-vaccine movement had been going from strength to strength, picking up millions of followers while developing its pitch and public relations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic supercharged the anti-vaccine rhetoric machine, pulling in millions more Americans angry about masking mandates and social distancing rules.

Concerns about their children’s food and other consumption led to concerns and skepticism about what had been injected into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the large corporations had lied to them about food and drink being healthy, they reasoned, the monolithic pharmaceutical companies were probably doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I've never been anti-vaccine'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In an attempt to understand what future changes may be coming to America's vaccine landscape, USA TODAY sat down for an exclusive interview with Kennedy at the Health and Human Services office in downtown Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In a wide-ranging conversation, Kennedy clarified his stance on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I've never been anti-vaccine," Kennedy said. "I've said that thousands and thousands of times. "My concern is that we should set proper safety tests for vaccines so that people understand, and we are able to understand, the risk profile for these products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts like Hotez consider statements like this misleading. Vaccines have already proven their worth because billions of people have taken them and side effects remain vanishingly rare, they argue. Vaccines that have been around for decades were tested originally, and have essentially been tested ever since, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's not good enough for Kennedy and his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy&lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/rfk-jr-flu-shot-vaccine/88220106007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; told USA TODAY that he questions whether he, himself, was injured by annual flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which he took until the mid 1990s and then later stopped entirely in 2005. The health secretary has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological voice disorder, that he says may have resulted from his vaccines, although the &lt;a href="https://dystonia-foundation.org/what-is-dystonia/common-misunderstandings/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has said vaccines don't cause the condition and can actually protect against some forms of dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Do I know that it was caused by my annual flu shot? I have no idea," he said. "It's a potential culprit that I cannot rule out, but I can't prove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy pledged to keep delving into the concerns of mothers like Bright and LoConti, who have lost their faith in the government to tell the truth about complicated medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"My job as HHS secretary is to tell the truth to people and then to let them to make up their own minds," he said. "And so we've implemented new policies here where we don't tell 'noble lies.' We tell the truth, whatever the impacts are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Trusting science, but only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a fundamental contradiction in the logic employed by crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to established science, and what the experts believe, the scientific community largely has their back when it comes to their views on &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/seed-oils-are-they-actually-toxic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, or trans fats, or how much screen time their kids should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But when it comes to vaccines, that support from the established scientific community all but evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and Lo Conti like to say they are simply asking questions – questions they need to ask about everything from the nutritional benefits of Oreos to the value of the measles vaccine – because nobody has ever really questioned these things before, at least not with real, honest American skepticism, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that’s not really true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Select a few “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” videos about nutrition – whether raising concerns about heavy metals in foods, or questioning the value of food dyes that are legal in the United States but banned in Europe – and it soon becomes clear that there are actually legitimate scientific concerns underpinning those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti question these things precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they can quickly and easily look up research from large, established scientific institutions that have also asked the same questions many times before. There are dozens of published scientific papers digging into the same concerns the crunchy moms have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to vaccines, however, the body of research is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Howard, an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at New York University who has written two books on the anti-vaccine movement, summed up one inherent challenge in researching vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One problem with vaccines is the good that they do is invisible, right?” Howard told USA TODAY. “No one ever comes home and says, ‘Boy, my kid didn't get measles today because of the vaccine,’ or ‘My kid didn't get polio today because of the vaccine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There exist vast troves of data showing how many lives vaccines have saved across the world, Howard said. Study after study has concluded that vaccines have helped eradicate certain diseases while controlling and mitigating others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio." data-c-credit="Andrew Dolph, Akron Beacon Journal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But for almost every legitimate study that concludes vaccines are beneficial, there are now counterparts that concerned mothers like Bright and LoConti can find online that raise concerns and fear about vaccines, Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The key difference, however, is that the vaccine-skeptical studies Bright and LoConti and other crunchy moms point to do not come from the same established sources that provide much of the fear and skepticism that drive their concerns about food and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Traditionally, scientists and doctors who have questioned vaccine safety, and even the benefits of vaccines, have quickly become pariahs. Their studies, documentaries and papers are often debunked, ridiculed and dismissed by experts on vaccines and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, Howard said, to become an anti-vaxxer, or even a vaccine-skeptic, one has to tangibly choose to believe a largely discredited subset of research that is not academically or scientifically sound, over what the vast majority of scientists have long established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s more than just skepticism, Howard said, it’s a form of wilful denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Nothing is wrong with being skeptical and there's nothing wrong with asking questions; the problem is when you don't accept the answers,” Howard said. “Anyone who now says that they are just asking questions about this sort of thing is not doing that.

			&lt;p&gt;Many people across cultures grow up hearing that cold weather makes you sick. Going outside without a coat, breathing in cold air, sleeping in a chilly room, getting caught in cold rain or snow, or simply feeling chilled are often blamed for causing colds or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief feels true to many people because illness often follows cold exposure. However, modern research shows that the connection between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cold-weather-49689"&gt;cold weather&lt;/a&gt; and illness is more nuanced than the idea that cold directly causes disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold temperatures themselves &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-winter-makes-you-more-vulnerable-to-colds-a-public-health-nurse-explains-the-science-behind-the-season-244803#"&gt;do not cause&lt;/a&gt; infections. Instead, they influence a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors that make people more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, especially &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17705968/"&gt;during the winter months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-cold-weather-cause-colds-heres-why-you-really-get-sick-in-winter"&gt;Does Cold Weather Cause Colds? Here's Why You Really Get Sick in Winter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colds and flu are caused by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, not by cold air. Viruses such as rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses spread from person to person through respiratory droplets or physical contact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33753932/"&gt;regardless of the temperature outside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg" alt="illustration of a virus" class="wp-image-189500 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Seasonal illnesses are typically caused by viruses. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD4GJySqjs/"&gt;Shutter2U/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, rates of respiratory infections consistently increase during colder seasons in many parts of the world – a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-people-get-more-colds-in-winter/"&gt;pattern that has been observed globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seasonal pattern is partly due to the way that cold temperatures and low humidity affect viruses in the environment. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2034399/"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that many respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, survive longer and remain infectious for extended periods in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7454058/"&gt;cold, dry conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air also causes tiny droplets released when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze to evaporate quickly. This creates smaller particles that stay suspended in the air longer, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/coronavirus-why-cold-winter-weather-makes-it-harder-to-fight-respiratory-infections"&gt;increasing the chance&lt;/a&gt; that others will inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, cold, dry air helps viruses persist in the environment and improves their chances of reaching another person's respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold air also &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;affects how the body defends itself&lt;/a&gt; against infection. Breathing in cold air lowers the temperature inside the nose and airways, which can trigger vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction means the narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lining of the nose and airways, this reduced blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036013232400221X#:%7E:text=The%20respiratory%20tract%20is%20mainly%20innervated%20by,nasal%20mucosa%20and%20adenoids%20%5B%2064%2C%2065%5D"&gt;can weaken local immune responses&lt;/a&gt; that normally help detect and eliminate viruses before they cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure and cold-related stress can also interfere with the normal function of the airways, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031196/#:%7E:text=For%20chronic%20patients%20with%20precarious%20respiratory%20balances,are%20both%20able%20to%20destabilize%20the%20patient"&gt;particularly in people&lt;/a&gt; with sensitive respiratory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these effects can suppress the body's first lines of defence in the nose and throat. Cold air does not create viruses, but it can make it easier for viruses to gain a foothold once exposure occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crowds and close contact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal changes in human behaviour and indoor environments &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323431"&gt;also play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Cold weather encourages people to spend more time indoors, often in close contact with others. Crowded spaces with poor ventilation allow virus-containing droplets to build up in the air, making transmission between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876"&gt;people more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During winter, reduced sunlight exposure leads to lower production of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D in the skin. Vitamin D is involved in regulating immune function, and low levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3074219/"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; weaker immune responses. Indoor heating, while essential for comfort, dries out the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air can dry the lining of the nose and throat, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8664457/"&gt;reducing the effectiveness of mucus&lt;/a&gt;. Mucus normally traps viruses and helps move them out of the airways, a process known as mucociliary clearance. When this system is impaired, viruses have an easier time infecting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold weather can be especially challenging for people with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis, which is commonly known as hay  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031646/"&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; (research that examines patterns of disease in populations) show that cold conditions can worsen symptoms and increase functional impairment in these people. This can intensify the effects of respiratory infections when they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the evidence paints a clear picture of what cold weather does and does not do. Cold temperatures are linked with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.15252/emmm.202115352"&gt;higher rates of respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;, including influenza and coronaviruses, particularly in temperate regions during winter. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151"&gt;Laboratory and environmental studies&lt;/a&gt; show that viruses survive longer and spread more easily in cold, dry air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;can also weaken immune defences&lt;/a&gt; in the nose and airways, including reduced mucus movement and decreased antiviral activity in nasal tissues. Behavioural and environmental factors typical of winter, such as indoor crowding, poor ventilation, and reduced sunlight, leading to lower vitamin D levels, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/17/3842"&gt;further increase the risk of viral spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the evidence does not support is the idea that simply being cold, such as stepping outside without a coat, directly causes a cold or flu. Instead, cold weather acts as a risk amplifier. It creates conditions that help viruses survive, spread, and overcome the body's defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this distinction has practical value. Improving indoor ventilation and maintaining adequate humidity during winter can reduce transmission risk. Supporting immune health, including maintaining adequate vitamin D levels, may also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health messages are most effective when they focus on how viruses spread through contact and respiratory droplets, rather than reinforcing the myth that cold exposure alone causes illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, cold weather and illness are linked, but not in the way many people assume. Cold temperatures do not cause infections by themselves. Instead, they shape the biological, environmental, and social conditions that allow respiratory viruses to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this complexity helps explain why colds and flu peak in winter and supports more effective strategies for prevention, while dispelling a simple but misleading belief about cold weather and sickness.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272935/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since a measles outbreak began in West Texas, and international health authorities say they will meet in April to determine if the U.S. has lost its measles-free designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the vaccine-preventable virus has regained a foothold and that the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;may soon follow Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in losing the achievement of having eliminated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reevaluation is largely symbolic and hinges on whether a single measles chain has spread uninterrupted within the U.S. for at least 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists around the country are investigating whether the now-ended Texas outbreak is linked to active ones in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina. But doctors and scientists say the U.S. — and North America overall — has a measles problem, regardless of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really a question of semantics,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, a Wisconsin family physician who helped certify the U.S. was measles-free in 2000. “The bottom line is the conditions are sufficient to allow this many cases to occur. And that gets back to de-emphasizing a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the most since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and nearly 50 separate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem has been years in the making, as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;fewer kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get routine vaccines due to parental waivers, health care access issues and rampant disinformation. More recently, Trump administration health officials have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-safety-mmr-autism-rfk-hepatitis-20d3122d7a9a339cd8447a347bd49928"&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;sown doubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the established safety of vaccines at an unprecedented level while also &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;defunding local efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to improve vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing that we can do is to make sure the people who aren’t vaccinated get vaccinated,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center. “We have not issued a clear enough message about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said Thursday that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has consistently emphasized vaccines as the best way to prevent measles, adding that the CDC is responding to outbreaks and working to increase vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the department said it doesn’t have evidence that a single chain of measles has spread for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Measles finds the unv&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;accinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little room for error in trying to stop measles. The virus is one of the most contagious, infecting 9 out of every 10 unvaccinated people exposed. Community-level protection takes a 95% vaccination rate. The current rate nationally is 92.5%, according to CDC data, but many communities fall far below that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in Texas’ first known case developed the telltale rash on Jan. 20, 2025, according to state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the outbreak exploded. Officially, 762 people fell ill, most of them in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;rural Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and two children died. Many more got sick and were never diagnosed: 182 potential measles cases among children in Gaines County went unconfirmed in March 2025 alone, state health officials said, a possible undercount of 44% in that county.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Such data gaps are common, though, making it especially hard to track outbreaks. Many people living in communities where the virus is spreading face health care barriers and distrust the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing so many cases is also expensive, said behavioral scientist Noel Brewer, who chairs the U.S. committee that will finalize the data for international health officials. Research shows &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-health-departments-723baa2b92828b04092475f4763585a6"&gt;a single measles case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cost public health departments &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data on measles is still among the best worldwide, Brewer said, but “the U.S. has changed its investment in public health, so we’re less able to do the case tracking that we used to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic sequencing can fill some gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always enough to say the outbreaks are connected. Genetically, the measles virus doesn’t change as often as, say, flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within an outbreak, everybody is going to look the same,” said Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question may then be how PAHO experts will navigate final data gaps, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a Utah physician and longtime CDC consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“My best guess is we will lose elimination status,” Pavia said. “The case for this not being continuous transmission is tenuous, and I think they are likely to err on the side of declaring it a loss of elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have confirmed the same measles strain in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, Canada, Mexico and several other North American countries, said Sebastian Oliel, a spokesperson for the Pan American Health Organization, which will make the final decision on U.S. measles elimination at an April 13 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliel said when there is a case of unknown origin in a country with ongoing local spread, “the most conservative approach is to consider the case part of the existing national transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Mexico also up for review&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO will review Mexico’s measles-free status alongside the U.S., Oliel said. That country’s largest outbreak has roots in Texas. It started when an 8-year-old boy from Chihuahua state got sick after visiting family in Seminole, Texas. Since last February, 6,000 people have gotten sick in Mexico, and 21 have died in Chihuahua state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under PAHO’s definition of elimination, borders matter. If, for example, the chain of measles that started in the U.S. spread to Mexico and then returned to the U.S. anew, it would be considered a new chain, experts said. Still, many experts call that standard outdated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that measles found ample fertile ground in the U.S. in 2025, infiltrating &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-school-attendance-absences-0384199ace95b4088f60864ce9ec8315"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and day cares, churches, hospital waiting rooms and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-new-mexico-detention-facility-migrants-outbreak-c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea"&gt;a detention center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. New Mexico logged 100 cases and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299"&gt;one adult died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Kansas officials spent seven months trying to control an outbreak that sickened nearly 90 people across 10 counties. Ohio confirmed 40 cases. Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin each had 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than 800 people have gotten sick across Utah, Arizona and South Carolina since late summer, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;with no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2025 was the year of measles,” Brewer said. “Will 2026 be the year of rising or falling measles cases? Does it get worse or does it get better? No one knows the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

across 27 U.S. states, including California, according to federal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus — called &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; — is considered an “&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25152-candida-auris"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emerging infectious disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” as health care providers have seen an increase in cases since 2019, Cleveland Clinic experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 20, California had reported 1, 524 cases of the fungal infection in 2025, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/251634"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt;

of 34%, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How do people get deadly fungal infection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. auris usually affects patients with severe underlying medical conditions and people with invasive medical devices such as breathing tubes, feeding tubes and catheters, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection spreads through surfaces and objects and can live on a patient’s skin or body sites even if they don’t have symptoms, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="12" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and visitors aren’t at risk of becoming infected, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What are symptoms of Candida auris?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While symptoms of &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called ticking biological clock has been framed largely as a concern for women. We talk about egg freezing, ovarian reserve, and the ticking timeline of maternal fertility. Meanwhile, the male timeline has often been treated as a flat line — men, the story goes, can father children well into their twilight years with little consequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is it that simple, though? For one, we know that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10909733/"&gt;children of older fathers face higher statistical risks&lt;/a&gt; for neurodevelopmental disorders, stillbirth, and metabolic issues. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the British Andrology Society, and the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society have advised that the upper limit for sperm donors for assisted conception should be 40 years old as a precautionary measure, “so that the potential hazards related to aging are diminished” on the basis of increased risk of genetic abnormalities in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mechanism, however, has remained a black box. Is it just about accumulating DNA mutations and epigenetics, or is there something else hitching a ride into the egg?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;suggests the answer lies in a hidden world of genetic instructions that science has largely missed. By peeling back the layers of sperm biology, researchers have discovered a molecular “aging cliff” — a dramatic, sudden shift in the RNA profile of sperm that occurs in mid-life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like finding a molecular clock that ticks with age in both mice and humans, suggesting a fundamental, conserved molecular signature of sperm aging,” says Qi Chen, MD, PhD, associate professor of urology and human genetics at U of U Health and one of the senior authors of the research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, though by no means definitive, represent a fundamental rethinking of what fathers pass down to their children, and how the aging process rewrites the code of life before conception even happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decoding-sperm-degradation"&gt;Decoding Sperm Degradation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand this discovery, you have to understand why we missed it for so long. For years, scientists focused on the DNA package inside the sperm head. We knew that, as men age, this DNA could become fragmented. But sperm also carry RNA, a molecule usually tasked with carrying out DNA’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem was that standard sequencing tools couldn’t see the whole picture. Sperm RNAs are often heavily modified chemically, which makes them invisible to traditional sequencing machines, almost like writing a message in invisible ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ml-form-align-center"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ml-form-embedWrapper embedForm"&gt;
            
            &lt;div class="zme-signup-container" id="zme-main-container"&gt;
                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Thank you! One more thing...&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;To solve this, Chen’s team utilized a technique they developed called PANDORA-seq. This method treats the RNA with enzymes that remove those chemical disguises, allowing the sequencer to read previously “unsequencable” molecules. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was a massive, previously hidden population of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), specifically those derived from transfer RNA (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA (rsRNAs)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These aren’t junk; they are regulatory elements that can control gene expression in the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied this “night vision” goggles approach to mouse sperm, the results were startling. They didn’t see a slow, linear decline. Instead, they saw a precipitous drop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 50 and 70 weeks of age in mice — roughly equivalent to mid-life in humans — the sperm RNA profile underwent a radical transformation. The researchers call it an “aging cliff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe this progressive length shift accumulates quietly, until it triggers the ‘cliff’ change at mid-life,” Chen suggests&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-paradox-of-length"&gt;The Paradox of Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most surprising aspect of this new data contradicts almost everything we thought we knew about aging and cellular decay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, when biological molecules age, they break down. DNA fragments, proteins degrade, and so on. You would expect the RNA in older sperm to be shorter, chopped up by the wear and tear of time. But the molecular clock in sperm runs backward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as the mice aged, specific ribosomal RNAs (rsRNAs) in the sperm head actually became &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt;. The ratio shifted: the abundance of longer RNA fragments increased, while the shorter ones decreased. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first glance, this finding seems counterintuitive,” Chen says. “For decades, we have known that as sperm age, their DNA becomes more fragmented and broken. One might expect RNA to follow this pattern. Instead, we found the opposite: specific sperm RNAs actually become longer with age”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? The study suggests that the machinery responsible for chopping these RNAs into precise, functional sizes might be getting “rusty.” The enzymes that process these molecules may lose efficiency due to oxidative stress, leaving the RNAs unprocessed and overly long.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a quirk of mouse biology. The team validated these findings in two human cohorts. They looked at sperm samples from the same donors collected years apart and found the exact same phenomenon: the rsRNAs in the sperm heads of older men were consistently longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Validating this finding from mice to humans was really exciting,” says Kenneth Aston, PhD, director of the Andrology &amp;amp; IVF Lab at the University of Utah and co-senior author on the paper. “Our sperm bank resources at the University of Utah made this cross-species validation possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-signal-in-the-noise"&gt;The Signal in the Noise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One reason this “aging cliff” remained elusive for so long is that sperm are complex structures. They have a head, which contains the genetic payload, and a long tail packed with mitochondria to power their swim to the egg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers sequenced whole sperm in the past, the RNA from the tail drowned out the signal from the head. Yet by physically separating the sperm heads and sequencing them in isolation, the team clarified the signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This rsRNA length shift was a unique signal, specific to the sperm heads. It was obscured by the ‘noisier’ profile of the whole sperm,” explains co-corresponding author Tong Zhou, PhD, associate professor of physiology and cell biology in the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. “Sequencing the sperm head sample is what made this discovery possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction is crucial because it is the sperm head that fuses with the egg and delivers the genetic material. The finding that these shifted RNAs are locked inside the nucleus suggests they are poised to influence the embryo immediately after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even though the sperm heads were stripped of their tails (and thus their main power plants), the researchers still found traces of mitochondrial RNA inside the head. These mitochondrial RNAs mirrored the aging patterns of the genomic RNAs, suggesting a coordinated system where the sperm nucleus and mitochondria communicate about the aging state of the cell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hacking-the-embryo"&gt;Hacking the Embryo&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question, of course, is: “So what?” Does it matter if a father’s sperm carries slightly longer bits of RNA?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers created a synthetic “cocktail” of RNAs that mimicked the profile of an older father — high in long rsRNAs, low in short ones. They injected this “old RNA” cocktail into mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a model for the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results provided a potential mechanism for the health issues seen in children of older fathers. The “old” RNA cocktail reprogrammed the stem cells. It triggered significant changes in gene expression, specifically ramping up pathways involved in metabolism and turning on genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies show that advanced paternal age is l&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443922000187"&gt;inked to metabolic disorders and behavioral anomalies&lt;/a&gt; in offspring. This study provides a molecular smoking gun: the “old” sperm RNA alone was enough to induce these changes in cellular programming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This discovery, made possible by PANDORA-seq, could lay the groundwork for future diagnostics to help guide informed reproductive decisions and improve fertility outcomes,” says James M. Hotaling, MD, Chief Innovation Officer at University of Utah Health and an author on the study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fertility testing for men is fairly rudimentary relative to the requirements mandated by the new findings. Clinics count sperm, check if they are swimming, and look at their shape. But at the moment, they rarely look under the hood at the molecular instructions they carry. This research suggests that in the future, men might screen their “sperm RNA age” to understand the risks they might pass on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is now hunting for the specific enzymes that control this RNA processing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can understand the enzymes driving this shift, they could become actionable targets for interventions to potentially improve sperm quality in aging males,” Chen says. “Stay tuned”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s plan to blame autism on women using acetaminophen (a.k.a. Tylenol) during pregnancy is getting more pushback from actual scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past weekend, researchers in Europe published a review of the scientific evidence on autism and acetaminophen. After accounting for known biases in past studies, they failed to find a connection between maternal acetaminophen use and a greater risk of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions in children. The findings indicate that women can continue to safely take the over-the-counter pain and fever medication as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Current evidence does not indicate a clinically important increase in the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or intellectual disability in children of pregnant individuals who use paracetamol as directed, supporting existing recommendations on its safety,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynecology, &amp;amp; Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No causative link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last September, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a supposed breakthrough: they found evidence of a potential link between autism and acetaminophen during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though RFK Jr. and other White House officials were somewhat more cautious in their tone, noting that further research would be needed to confirm a causative relationship, Trump was not. At the press conference announcing the findings, he repeatedly told women to immediately stop using acetaminophen. Despite the lack of a smoking gun, the administration also stated it would take regulatory action, such as adding a warning label to acetaminophen products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time, however, rebuffed the administration’s claims. While some studies have suggested a possible link, many others haven’t, including studies explicitly designed to address limitations of observational research. Following Trump’s announcement, the UK and many other countries have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000663086"&gt;continued to endorse&lt;/a&gt; the use of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol in much of the world) during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is the only widely recommended painkiller for pregnant women, since other drugs can have serious side effects, including a &lt;a href="https://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/September2022/Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory%20drugs-NSAIDs-avoid-use%20in-pregnancy.html#:~:text=NSAID%20use%20in%20early%20pregnancy,some%20cases%2C%20neonatal%20renal%20impairment."&gt;higher risk of miscarriages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and elsewhere analyzed data from 43 high-quality studies. Some of these studies compared the outcomes of siblings born to the same mother who reported using acetaminophen during one pregnancy but not the other. Since siblings share many genetic and environmental factors in common, these studies can better account for potential noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, when the researchers included sibling studies in their analysis, they found no significant link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and a greater risk of children developing autism, intellectual disability, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also failed to find a link when they only included studies judged to be at low risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself,” said study author Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at City St George’s, University of London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2026/january2/taking-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-does-not-increase-risk-of-autism-adhd-or-intellectual-disabilities"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings echo those of a similar review &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/science-keeps-dismantling-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000683647"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last November, which also failed to find convincing evidence of a causative link between acetaminophen and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The major takeaway&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though no drug should be used more than needed, the authors are unequivocal about the implications of their research: Pregnant women shouldn’t be overly stressed about using acetaminophen/paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The message is clear—paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,” Khalil said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that this study, or any other independent research, will deter the Trump administration from moving forward with its attempt to scapegoat Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-makes-bizarre-connection-between-circumcision-tylenol-and-autism-2000670971"&gt;White House Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; discussing the report in early October, RFK Jr. acknowledged that the government did not have proof that acetaminophen can cause autism. Immediately after, however, he stated, “We’re doing the studies to make the proof.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s gnasty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scourge of mosquitoes has been terrorizing residents of El Segundo for the past two months — and the situation is only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say they are covered in bites and welts despite trying to eliminate the infestation, &lt;a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/el-segundo-mosquito-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fox 11 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many describe the infestation as overwhelming, saying mosquitoes have overrun yards and made their way inside homes, disrupting sleep and daily routines. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents in El Segundo say they have been locked in a relentless fight against mosquitoes for nearly two months, swatting and spraying at all hours of the day and night, with little sign of improvement. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Locals have been swatting and spraying for months, sometimes for hours at a time. But the mosquitoes continue to overrun their yards and homes, and are making it hard to carry out daily routines or even sleep at night, they said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sounds are constant,” resident Truman Hedding told Fox 11, referring to the repeated zap of electric mosquito swatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you get them, it’s the best, most satisfying thing in the world — but it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say the mosquito surge began nearly two months ago and has only intensified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are covered in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/health/ivermectin-could-be-the-key-to-curbing-malaria/"&gt;mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt; every night,” Samantha Hedding told Fox 11. “My kids have welts. We’re late to school because we’re up until 4 or 5 in the morning killing mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;She said the insects are getting inside homes despite residents taking extreme precautions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many describe the infestation as overwhelming, saying mosquitoes have overrun yards and made their way inside homes, disrupting sleep and daily routines. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are in our house. Every door is locked, every window is sealed,” Hedding said. “If a door opens, we all freak out. The weather has been beautiful, but we can’t enjoy it. We can’t open our windows or doors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city said it has been working to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“El Segundo is working aggressively with the City of Los Angeles and Vector Control to find the sources of this &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/lifestyle/mosquitoes-takes-over-entire-plane/"&gt;massive infestation&lt;/a&gt;,” El Segundo Mayor Chris Pimentel told Fox 11. “We are making progress in the northern part of the outbreak and are focused on the six blocks that are still under siege.”&lt;/p&gt;

If these symptoms persist or worsen, it’s best to check with a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He emphasises the importance of accurate diagnosis during this season: “With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/winter-illnesses-tips-to-protect-yourself-from-norovirus-covid-19-flu-and-rsv-101736599352339.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="winter illnesses"&gt;winter illnesses&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, getting the right diagnosis is key to recovery and avoiding complications.

Get tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what’s making you sick is the first step to getting better. If you have symptoms of a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-polymicrobial-respiratory-infection-that-pope-francis-is-battling-101739876996097.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="respiratory infection"&gt;respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt;, talk to your doctor and consider a quick test. Rapid tests help give fast answers, empowering your doctor to choose the right treatment so you can recover sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Monitor your condition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on your symptoms and their intensity. If your fever is rising or any symptoms are worsening, consult your doctor immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Seek treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With early diagnosis, you can promptly seek treatment. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Make sure to properly adhere to the full course of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-20-years-of-experience-explains-why-blood-sugar-rises-despite-strict-diets-and-regular-medication-101768897795335.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="medication"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; and guidelines your doctor may have prescribed, to help relieve symptoms and fight the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Take care of yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get plenty of rest and sleep. Take it easy, stay well hydrated (such as with water, broths, coconut water, or fresh juice), and eat healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;5. Stay home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you are experiencing symptoms of illness, you should isolate yourself so you can take time to recuperate, while also ensuring the infection is not spread further to other people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;“With winter in full swing, it’s important to stay ahead and protect your health. If you’re feeling well, keep up simple preventive habits, like washing hands, wearing a mask in crowded places, and maintaining distance. Vaccines for flu and pneumonia are one of the best ways to stay protected. By taking these steps, you can enjoy the season safely and keep your loved ones healthy,” concludes Dr Sonu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

                &lt;p&gt;We’ve got great news for everyone who’s ever been kept awake until the wee hours of the morning by a family member or housemate screaming obscenities at their monitor while playing video games. Your lectures about how playing video games for so long isn’t healthy now have new scientific justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in the journal Nutrition found an association between gaming more than 10 hours a week and poor diet quality, higher body mass, and lower sleep quality. The research suggests that playing video games isn’t the main problem, but overdoing the amount of time dedicated to it, according to Mario Siervo, a co-author of the study from the Curtin School of Population Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Hardcore gaming might impact health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep and body weight,” he said in a Curtin University &lt;a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/news/media-release/study-reveals-how-many-hours-of-video-games-per-week-might-be-too-many/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Siervo and his coworkers worked with over 300 students from Australian universities who self-reported how much time they spent gaming per week. Based on this information, the team organized them into three categories—low gamers (0 to 5 hours of gaming per week), moderate gamers (5 to 10 hours per week), and high gamers (more than 10 hours per week).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Low and moderate gamers described similar health statuses, which were significantly worse for high gamers. For example, the researchers noted lower diet quality for high gamers. Heavy gamers were more likely to be obese, with a median BMI of 26.3. By comparison, low and moderate gamers had healthier averages of 22.2 and 22.8, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity and other lifestyle factors,” Siervo explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Poor sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to argue against your household gamer logging 10 hours a week, sleep quality might be your strongest case. In the study, all three categories reported poor sleep quality overall, though moderate and high gamers had lower scores than low gamers. The study found an important association between gaming hours and sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This study doesn’t prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors,” Siervo clarified. “Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly and staying active.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which he added: “Because university habits often follow people into adulthood, healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-sleep-switch-triggers-a-sudden-tipping-point-in-the-brain/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, mood, and quality of life were tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruitment took place in Granada and Pamplona, and participants kept their normal routines while the study team tracked daily timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists led by Antonio Clavero-Jimeno, MSc at the University of Granada (&lt;a href="https://www.ugr.es/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UGR&lt;/a&gt;) coordinated the work with partners, and everyone received classes based on the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assignments split people into usual care alone or three schedules that limited daily eating hours, letting timing be the only real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-restricted-eating"&gt;Time-restricted eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting meals to set hours each day is called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-finally-answer-the-question-of-when-is-the-best-time-to-shower/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;-restricted eating (TRE), meals confined to a daily window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12-week &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12199060/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, participants kept eating over at least 12 hours or chose an eight-hour window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early TRE started before 10 a.m., late TRE after 1 p.m., and the self-selected group picked its own window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because calorie targets stayed flexible, the schedule mainly changed when food arrived, which can influence hormones and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-earlier-dinner-seemed-key"&gt;Why earlier dinner seemed key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers expected meal timing might matter because &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/early-sleep-times-linked-to-enhanced-activity-during-the-day/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; depends on when the body switches from daytime metabolism to nighttime repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That switch follows circadian rhythms – internal clocks that guide daily body functions – and late dinners can push signals later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher evening &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4418873/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that signals biological night, can reduce insulin release after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If late eating raises blood sugar near bedtime, some people may feel more wired, but this pathway may differ widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exact-sleep-measurements"&gt;Exact sleep measurements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying only on memory-based surveys, the team monitored sleep in a way that captures real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore accelerometry, wrist sensors that measure tiny movements, for two weeks before the program and again at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those data let researchers estimate sleep onset, wake time, and how often people woke up during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because wrist movement cannot map sleep stages, the findings speak to overall sleep timing and continuity, not brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-changed-and-what-did-not"&gt;What changed and what did not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, sleep outcomes looked much alike across all four groups, whether meals started early or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 197 participants, early TRE differed from usual care by about 0.2 hours, or 12 minutes, of total sleep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-leisure-time-hobbies-can-improve-your-work-life/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures like sleep efficiency, awakenings, and perceived sleep quality also showed overlaps when early, late, and self-selected TRE were compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people hoping earlier dinner will lengthen sleep, the data suggest timing alone is unlikely to deliver that change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-daily-functioning"&gt;Mood and daily functioning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood and quality of life were tracked with standard questionnaires because diet changes can affect stress and daily energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, anxiety, and stress scores moved little, and broader health ratings on the SF-36, a survey of daily health and function, stayed similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TRE appeared to be a well-tolerated nutritional strategy for managing body weight without apparent adverse effects on overall sleep health and psychological well-being in both men and women regardless of the fasting-eating window implemented,” wrote Clavero-Jimeno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern suggests an eight-hour eating window does not automatically trigger emotional strain, at least during a supervised program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-closer-look-at-limits"&gt;A closer look at limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was designed first to track abdominal fat, so it may miss smaller changes in sleep or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also entered with only mild sleep complaints, which can make improvement harder to spot over a short program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis did not adjust for chronotype, a person’s natural preference for sleep timing, and timing effects can depend on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because coffee and tea were allowed during fasting, caffeine could have blurred differences, and one author reported industry ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-these-results-apply-to"&gt;Who these results apply to&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were adults ages 30 to 60 with overweight or obesity, not people with severe sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with overnight or rotating work hours and diagnosed sleep or eating disorders were excluded, so the findings may not fit those routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-selected TRE may resemble how many people try this approach, but the program still included regular nutrition education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside a structured setting, stress from work schedules, family meals, or medication timing could lead to different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meal-timing-sleep-and-human-health"&gt;Meal timing, sleep, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weight management, the bigger question is whether a restricted window is sustainable, not whether it boosts sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, adherence ran about 85 percent to 88 percent, and no serious adverse events occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That safety profile may ease concerns that longer fasting will backfire by worsening sleep or making people feel tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since timing did not alter well-being, choosing early or late TRE can be guided by work, family, and hunger patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings show that moving a daily eating window earlier or later did not meaningfully change sleep or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies can test longer programs in people with rotating hours and insomnia patients, using polysomnography, an overnight test that records brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While some studies have found that whey protein may help lower cholesterol, results are mixed, and more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whey protein can pose health risks, including contamination, gastrointestinal side effects, and stress on the liver and kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speak with your healthcare provider before taking whey protein supplements and discuss ways to lower your cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whey protein may have health benefits, primarily for athletes and those looking to increase muscle mass. Some studies suggest that whey protein supplementation may help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels, particularly when combined with exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The effects of consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/whey-protein-uses-side-effects-and-more-7498855" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whey protein&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-cholesterol-5188323" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; are not well-established. Some studies have shown promising results, while others have found no change in cholesterol levels or a detrimental effect:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 2020 meta-analysis found that whey protein may help lower &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-high-triglycerides-697535" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-causes-high-ldl-bad-cholesterol-5185421" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-a-total-cholesterol-level-698073" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;total cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and increase beneficial &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/raising-your-hdl-levels-1745267" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;high-density lipoprotein (HDL)&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol. However, the meta-analysis's results were mixed due to differences in study methods and participant types.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other studies have also found that whey protein may improve cholesterol levels in specific groups, such as those with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/metabolic-syndrome-1745266" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More research is needed to determine the optimal amount and timing of whey protein consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some potential benefits of whey protein include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a complete protein&lt;/strong&gt;: Whey protein contains sufficient amounts of all nine &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/amino-acids-8660561" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential amino acids&lt;/a&gt;, which must be acquired through diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps meet protein needs&lt;/strong&gt;: Whey protein supplements may help specific groups, such as vegetarian athletes, those with medical conditions, and those who are underweight and do not take in enough protein through diet alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help with muscle building and recovery after exercise&lt;/strong&gt;: Some athletes use whey protein to help with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/body-composition-5509458" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;body composition&lt;/a&gt; and promote muscle recovery. Dosage and timing are essential for efficacy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help contribute to prevention and improvement of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases&lt;/strong&gt;: When combined with nutritious diets, physical activity, and other healthy lifestyle practices, whey protein may help with factors associated with these conditions. These include insulin resistance, increased blood sugar after eating, oxidative stress, and blood lipid profiles (more long-term research is needed).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May be helpful for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&lt;/strong&gt;: Some research has found that whey protein may help improve symptoms and lower the risk of complications for people with IBD. However, more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help with weight management:&lt;/strong&gt; High-protein diets may help with weight loss by boosting satiety and metabolic rate and decreasing appetite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whey protein also has some &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/side-effects-of-protein-powder-11788276" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potential downsides and risks&lt;/a&gt;, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may be unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt;: Most people can get enough &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/are-egg-whites-healthy-8779493" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein from foods&lt;/a&gt; in their diet, without the added costs and risks of supplementing with whey protein. It may benefit some people with increased protein needs, such as trained professional athletes, older adults with a limited appetite, and those on a restricted diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein powder is not rigorously regulated&lt;/strong&gt;: It is classified as a supplement and not regulated in the same way as food or medicine, which could lead to safety and quality concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra protein doesn't mean extra strength&lt;/strong&gt;: Many factors go into building muscle mass and strength, including hormones and physical training. Just upping protein intake won't lead to desired results.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much protein can cause health risks&lt;/strong&gt;: Consuming too much protein could lead to increased fat (extra protein is eventually converted into fat), stress on your kidneys and liver, and side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, cramping, flatulence, and loss of appetite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May contain heavy metals and toxins&lt;/strong&gt;: Some whey protein products have been found to contain heavy metal contaminants, such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury. Other toxins, such as &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;bisphenol-A&lt;/span&gt; (BPA), pesticides, or other contaminants linked to health conditions such as cancer, have also been found, sometimes in high quantities.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term effects are unknown&lt;/strong&gt;: Limited information exists on the possible side effects and complications of consuming a high-protein supplement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some products contain additives&lt;/strong&gt;: Some protein powders may be high in sugar, sometimes approaching the daily recommended sugar limit with one scoop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May increase acne&lt;/strong&gt;: Some research has found that whey protein consumption was associated with increased acne severity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

But new research suggests that there could be a specific culprit to blame: certain preservatives—and these show up in more foods than just processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The BMJ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is opening up more questions about associations between processed foods and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA; Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;; Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group &lt;/a&gt;and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at diet and health data from more than 105,000 people between 2009 and 2023. On the dietary front, researchers specifically looked at the impact of 17 different preservatives on a range of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found there wasn’t a link between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; types of preservatives and a higher risk of cancer, they found clear associations between some preservatives and specific types of cancer. Those included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium sorbate and breast cancer, overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium metabisulfite and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium nitrite and prostate cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium nitrate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetic acid and overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium erythorbate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of preservatives (11 out of 17) were not linked with a higher risk of cancer. So, what’s behind this and, more importantly, what should you take away from the latest research? Here’s what the data found, plus what experts suggest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods do these preservatives show up in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get surprising. While plenty of people were exposed to these preservatives through processed meats, there were other, less obvious sources. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might these preservatives be linked to cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found a link between certain preservatives and cancer, they didn’t dive into why this association exists. Still, this is “likely to be a combination of factors,” including the composition of the foods these preservatives are used in, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik points out that the exact way these preservatives impact the body and affect cancer risk isn’t well known. “Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166445X22002065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that preservatives like nitrates and nitrites change the immune environment and can change the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10915207/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in genetic alterations of cells,” he says. “But there’s a lot more work to better understand the exact relationship of these preservatives and the development of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center—James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, agrees, and says it’s important not to panic. "We cannot say that the preservatives caused the cancer—there may be many other factors that led to that diagnosis,” she says. But in addition to impacting the gut bacteria, Champion points out that some preservatives may promote inflammation in the body. (Inflammation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious diseases, including cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for why some of these preservatives were linked to cancer and others weren’t, Champion says it may come down to their chemical structure and how our bodies metabolize preservatives. “Some are broken down and eliminated easily, while others may undergo chemical changes in the body that could be more problematic,” Champion says. “The bottom line is that some preservatives appear more concerning than others based on this research, which is actually helpful information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important to remember that the study didn’t find that foods that contained these preservatives &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; cancer. “We have to remember correlation does not always equal causation,” says Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “Preservatives are most abundant in foods that have excess added sugar, saturated fat, and other ingredients that can drive up cancer risk,” she says. Moskovitz also points out that it’s possible that people who eat a lot of foods with preservatives may not be eating a sufficient amount of cancer-fighting foods, like fresh fruit, veggies, and other antioxidant-rich, plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reason, the study’s authors call for more investigation into the link. “These findings may have important public health implications given the ubiquitous use of these additives in a wide range of foods and beverages,” they wrote in the study. They also noted that the findings present “new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to entirely avoid preservatives in food, but you can make a conscious decision to minimize how much preservatives you take in, points out Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;. “In general, a lot of the foods that [preservatives] are added to are not very nutrient-dense,” she says. “Regardless of the specific preservative, you’re not getting much in the way of protective benefits from those foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik agrees. “We really need to think carefully about what we order, what we eat,” he says. That includes focusing on shopping the outer sections of the grocery store first (these tend to feature fresh produce, dairy, and meats), before making your way to the center aisles. “These are foods that are not necessarily processed to last for long periods of time,” Dr. Bilchik says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just another reason to encourage people to eat more minimally-processed foods that have a lot of nutrients that have been shown to help protect against cancer,” Cording says. “Does that mean you can’t enjoy the occasional deli sandwich or ketchup on your burger with a glass of wine? Absolutely not,” Moskovitz says. “Not only is that unrealistic, but unnecessary if you have an otherwise healthy lifestyle and balanced diet. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Bilchik notes that there’s more to cancer risk than preservatives, making this just one part of cancer prevention. “Genetic factors are certainly one part, and we cannot control those,” he says. “In terms of lifestyle, exercise, avoiding smoking, stress reduction...there are so many other factors involved in cancer reduction other than what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOWEZIeVZ6dnVWdTF0dkt5ZFEwRkktc1B6V1ZhbE5IU1EwVHNtb2dQSE80SkZsOVFnNDFwYlo5Y095WVpWeVRwQ24yWUNqZjFWazdSLWtxenhZdEYzYVUza013bENpVWVWSmdBcWswOTdZTm5PZ3U5NHJKbVF3TjJJeldYcjM4TWV0aC1Z</guid></item><item><title>增强免疫系统无效的5种方法（浪费$ 100s ） -金钱谈话新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/ways-to-boost-your-immune-system-that-dont-work-and-waste-s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:29:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeElLLVVRZWsxcWRsdWpxbDhOano0VkRwYXc4aElLQ1N3aXZ3TTVpQW5Ob1RuaUlBQTUzMklEem5odFBCdTZzZTkyNzdVSTNEVjN6WVI3VVNWVGg3T2tMbjdINjB1dlh6QTV0NXQxLUZTOUQ2cGlOYnZtVUhfNGtERHFXeUtpcFhzMXJVMER5Vm5XZl9vZmc</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情创纪录的一年。这可能是致命卷土重来的开始- KSL新闻</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51435585/us-had-record-breaking-year-for-measles-it-may-be-the-start-of-a-deadly-comeback</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Tuesday marks one year since a measles outbreak started in west Texas, and there have been new cases in the United States each week since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas reported more than 760 cases — and the deaths of two children – before declaring the outbreak over in August. It was the largest outbreak the US had seen in decades, and since then, other large outbreaks — one in the upstate region of South Carolina and another on the border of Utah and Arizona — have amassed hundreds of cases each and continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of 2026 have been some of the worst yet, with exposures reported at schools, churches, restaurants, shops, airports and more. The continuous spread of measles over the past year leaves the US at risk of losing elimination status, which the country has held since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is startling, because just a few years ago, measles was very rare in the United States," said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, ​an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we're seeing in a single week what we might have seen in an average year," she said. "There's been a real shift in the presence of this preventable disease in our life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that balance can shift back depends on how quickly the US can improve vaccination coverage, experts say – which, in many ways, has become an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, which is nearly as many as the average annual total in those 25 years since elimination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of cases — more than 95% — have been in people who had not been vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear that the situation may have to get much worse before it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's particularly devastating, they say, because the illnesses and deaths they foresee are almost entirely preventable with the help of vaccines — but lagging coverage has left many vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear yet whether the US will maintain its measles elimination status. In April, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, will formally make the determination. The decision will require a detailed review of epidemiological and laboratory evidence to understand patterns of measles spread over the past year — including whether more recent outbreaks are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts say that formally losing measles elimination status would be a symptom of more deeply rooted issues, particularly challenges with vaccination that have been building for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's face it, whether we lose elimination status or not in spring, is our public health system actually doing well?" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who resigned in protest last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles elimination is a vital sign of our public health system. That public health system is blue in the ICU," he said. "I don't need to check its pulse to know [it's not doing well]. I know the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record share of U.S. kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination last school year, according to data from the CDC, marking the fifth year in a row that coverage with the MMR vaccine was below the federal target of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that the increase in vaccine exemptions may be "due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy." A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a "medical" reason to request an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines are a victim of their own success. It's not just that we eliminated measles. I think we eliminated the memory of measles," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit remembers speaking with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC557162/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maurice Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist who developed the MMR vaccine and dozens of others, just months before Hilleman's death in 2005. Measles cases had reached a record low in 2004 but were starting to trend up again, just a few years after the US had achieved elimination following a long and hard-fought battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I asked him, 'Do you think that we can educate people about the importance of the vaccine, about the serious nature of this disease, or does the virus have to come back?" Offit said. He said there was a tear in his eye when he replied that the virus was going to have to come back to teach that lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was an enormous defeat for him," Offit said. "It's an enormous defeat for us to once again see children be exposed to something that could kill them — and did kill them – in this country, when that was completely unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems more and more that the virus isn't necessarily doing that, educating either, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three deaths from measles last year — as many as there had been over the past 25 years combined — yet it's been a struggle to increase vaccination rates, even in communities that experienced outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina health department has offered a mobile vaccination clinic since the early weeks of the outbreak in the upstate region of the state, but state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell has said that uptake has been "disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks tend to occur in under-vaccinated pockets of the U.S., often in tight-knit communities, such as those with certain religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;When Gwyn Bateman accidentally fell into a fire pit late last year, she thought receiving medical care in Clark County would be a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trip to the emergency room, the lifelong Salmon Creek resident went to get her wounds treated at a local clinic under her insurance. However, not long after, she was referred to Portland’s Legacy Emanuel Medical Center to see a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once she was able to see a doctor there, she discovered her burns were more severe than she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process took about a month and ended with Bateman undergoing skin graft surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“I’m surprised that I couldn’t get that quality of care here on this side of the river,” Bateman said. “Having to go to Portland can be time consuming. I prefer to do all my business here in Clark County.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Columbian spoke to several Clark County residents who sought specialty care in Portland. Many described the process as frustrating and isolating but also said the experience was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Kauffman, a specialized nurse practitioner and owner of Vancouver Direct Primary Care, said it’s common for communities, big and small, not to have specialists. Before starting his private practice, he worked at critical access hospitals, which had no specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he believes what patients in Clark County are experiencing is the result of an ongoing national physician shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Data shows the health care workforce is not growing at the same rate needed to provide for growing populations, like Clark County, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Surveys by the health nonprofit suggest COVID-19 could have accelerated the shortage with physicians quitting or planning to quit their jobs at even higher rates due to burnout, according to a 2024 report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections outline a worst-case potential shortfall of 5,500 specialists by 2036, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patients right now in Vancouver are really struggling being seen by specialty care, and it’s because of the shortage,” Kauffman said. “I send a lot of patients to Portland, but it’s always based on where I can get people in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illana Cour of Battle Ground said she’s familiar with the medical limbo patients face when waiting for a spot at a Portland hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her 2-year-old daughter was struggling with chronic ear infections and in and out of urgent care until she was referred to ear, nose and throat specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Both referrals were to Portland hospitals because the infection became too complex to address through her local clinic, Cour said. Treatment included a sleep study at Randall Children’s Hospital and surgery at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a year to address her daughter’s health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was quite serious,” Cour said. “The whole time I’m thinking ‘I wish this was closer.’ At the end of the day, when we are experiencing the frustration of having to cancel plans because she’s sick or canceled travel because of an ear infection, that part got really isolating and really frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Sanchez, CEO of The Oregon Clinic, the largest private multispecialty physician practice in Oregon, said thousands of Clark County residents seek specialty care across the clinic’s locations in the Portland metro area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Clark County resident himself, Sanchez said he understands patients’ frustration. Because The Oregon Clinic offers harder-to-access subspecialties, even patients from Alaska and Idaho go to Portland to seek care.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“I think the deep expertise patients often need for more complex medical issues — that drive, that commute, that inconvenience may be worth it,” Sanchez said. “I think we would love to see better access closer to patients’ homes, and sometimes that’s not always possible just based on the supply of physicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Vancouver’s Martha Wiley, seeking care in Portland is worth the commute. She previously lived in Hawaii, where there weren’t specialists near her to care for her multiple sclerosis at the time. When deciding where to live next, she chose Clark County to be near Portland, known for its wide access to neurology care. Every three months, she takes paratransit to OHSU Hospital to receive specialty treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, we’ve lived in places where it’s been a lot harder to access specialty care than here,” Wiley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez said he would like to see health care improve when it comes to getting patients to the right provider at the right time. Developing a strong relationship with a primary care provider helps.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, there’s the relationship between the primary care provider and the specialist so they can really collaborate together on taking the best care of the patient,” Sanchez said. “It’s so important. That collaboration is not the same as it used to be. From my perspective, that’s such an important part of our health care ecosystem.”
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But interpreting what those markers mean for an individual remains a major challenge, and different labs vary in their methodology, leading to differing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are still in the infancy of understanding how to interpret them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Crunch time: are freeze-dried fruit and veg actually healthy to eat or just chips in a different form? | Antiviral","elementId":"bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/freeze-dried-fruit-veg-healthy-food-nutrition-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a gut microbiome test is ordered by a specialist doctor or accredited dietitian with a clear clinical reason, sent to a reputable lab, and interpreted by someone trained to make sense of the results, it can be genuinely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong recently saw a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and rectal bleeding who had already undergone standard medical tests. The microbiome results, in that case, helped confirm dietary issues and guide further treatment once simple and important issues had been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But these cases are the exception, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy mix of organisms in one person could be problematic in another; “The same organism has different species and acts differently in different individuals,” Leong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It means for the vast majority of people who order these tests online, and who may be curious about their gut health or wondering about their symptoms or foods to avoid, “there are no translatable benefits” to ordering a test, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Temporary dietary changes, medications or illness could all affect the results, and what those results actually mean for an individual’s health outcomes isn’t well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="false-alarms-can-cause-distress" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;False alarms can cause distress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of Leong’s patients who took a commercial home test came to him panicking about bowel cancer after the report suggested she had certain inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong said a colonoscopy remains the definitive test to investigate bowel polyps and cancers. The free home bowel screening test issued by the Australian government, which looks for hidden blood in stool, is an evidence-based way to detect early warning signs of bowel cancer and may prompt follow-up testing, including a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And while some home gut microbiome tests claim to offer insights into metabolism or inflammation, “very few experts can use these results appropriately at present,” Leong said, including gastroenterologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is because clinicians aren’t trained to interpret the complex outputs the tests generate, the science is still developing, and there aren’t clear guidelines on what to do with the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-illusion-of-control" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;The illusion of control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At-home microbiome tests are spruiked by online influencers as a way of empowering people who want more insights into their health. But Dr Erica Zurawski, an assistant professor in environmental studies, said this encourages consumers to internalise health responsibility while giving their personal data to large for-profit companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0e4c8499-0dfd-4816-88f0-4e4e42cec81b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"More kissing, less kimchi: seven surprising ways to boost your gut health","elementId":"0e4c8499-0dfd-4816-88f0-4e4e42cec81b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/19/kimchi-kissing-seven-surprising-ways-boost-gut-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41157986/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has examined how&lt;/a&gt; direct‑to‑consumer microbiomeare often pitched “as a wholesale solution to myriad health issues when, in fact, they oversimplify the complexity of the inner workings of the gut, its malleability, and the impact external factors have on it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It makes people feel they are doing something wrong, “while the underlying issues that cause poor gut health,” including the influence of harmful industries and government policies, are “side-stepped,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-06260-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complexity gets smoothed over and ignored&lt;/a&gt; … testing kits fail to account for things such as stress, pollution, or access to meaningful health care to address adjacent health issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="back-to-basics" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Back to basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So how can you actually support gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong says: “A diverse diet, high in fibre” is a sensible place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Zurawski adds that governments have a responsibility to address the broader social and environmental conditions that influence gut health, including poverty, housing, pollution, and access to affordable, nutritious food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you are experiencing gut symptoms or concerns, Leong recommends seeing a qualified dietitian or GP before jumping to expensive, at-home testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="448e717d-2246-4ec6-8079-29236eb96724" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"448e717d-2246-4ec6-8079-29236eb96724","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

ROACH: I am an 80-year-old female on Eliquis who has many bruises on her legs that do not go away. Is there a remedy for this situation? -- R.D.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5Y5EU4HUBGYBERYHSROISNVMU"&gt;ANSWER: Eliquis is an anticoagulant; it reduces the body’s ability to make blood clots by affecting clotting factors. We are all constantly breaking small blood vessels, but in people in their 80s, blood vessels are a bit more fragile and are prone to break with minor trauma. Even people who aren’t on anticoagulants can develop bruising on their arms or legs. But when a person is on apixaban (Eliquis) or a similar drug, the anticoagulant is most likely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TWJ7BOIGYBA5ZKDPI5YLAESYNE"&gt;Some nutrients that are found in fruits and vegetables can help the blood vessels stay stronger, so a healthy diet is probably your best bet to reduce bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GDUDW24QKBFYZIGOSYVWYMBOIE"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: How is “wet brain” (or Wernicke encephalopathy, WE) diagnosed? My son has been in the hospital, a rehab facility, and now an assisted living facility. Is there hope that he may walk again? He does not have any motivation and stays in bed most days playing on his phone. He hates being at a retirement home because he is 45, but he can’t take care of himself. He has lost his family and career because of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5244BEWNMFFGBGRDVJ5EDGGCW4"&gt;The physical therapist told me that he has wet brain. The doctor said it is a neuropathy and that his brain is shrinking. Please advise; we are seeking help for him to get better and out on his own. -- M.L.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKJZAZR2NZCBVFWR3VBXVK3A4I"&gt;ANSWER: WE is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1). (I had never heard the term “wet brain” to describe this illness, but I see it used sometimes. When I hear “wet brain,” I think of hydrocephalus, a condition of too much fluid in the brain, but this is clearly not what you are asking about.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L2JPZYPTGRAARAOV7G5ZTFL4UQ"&gt;Over 90% of cases of WE are associated with alcohol use. People with chronic, heavy alcohol use often do not get adequate thiamine from food, and in addition, alcohol can affect the absorption of thiamine and its storage in the liver. It is likely that there are genetic variants of metabolic enzymes that predispose a person to getting WE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MXLR5O5BZBB2DH3F7QHL7CZEY4"&gt;There are three classic findings in WE. The first is encephalopathy, which is characterized by disorientation, a poor attention span, and general indifference. Expert exams reveal the second issue: paralysis of certain eye muscles. Gait abnormalities are the third set of classic findings, with a gait where the feet are wide apart, consisting of slow steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VMQVSVD7HRCKHLTRVCHOXNVOKQ"&gt;Both the eye movement and gait disorders are a type of neuropathy caused by low thiamine. His doctor mentions shrinking of the brain (“atrophy”), which is common in WE but not at all specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6WBLGKHLFGCLGZ6RDNLEOAI7A"&gt;A late manifestation of the encephalopathy is a condition called Korsakoff syndrome, in which there is profound amnesia. Some people develop confabulation -- making up stories that are completely untrue but make sense in the context of a conversation. It is thought that people with Korsakoff syndrome are unaware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TDIEMCJW5VCBZN5JYRG2LKAIYE"&gt;I wish I had better news for your son on the possibility of recovery, as only rapid and immediate administration of thiamine is effective at resolving symptoms. If a person did not get adequate thiamine, then most people do not recover completely. If he has not gotten better, the outlook is poor, although I have read about a handful of cases where people with this condition improved after some months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5GX4HNRNVBFO7FLIAX2OSAU7F4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

At a time when autism was little known or understood, in 1962 he co-founded the UK’s leading autistic charity. As its first chair, he was the driving force in publicising the condition and raising funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He helped set up the world’s first autism-specific school in 1965 and the first residential community for autistic adults in 1974. As one of a group of lawyers, he campaigned for the Education (Handicapped Children) Act in 1970, which gave all children, regardless of disability, the right to an education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron was impelled into activism by the plight of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/17/autism-education-saskia-baron-brother" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his son Timothy&lt;/a&gt;. Born in 1956, as a toddler Timothy had little to no speech and an aloofness that set him apart from other children as well as behavioural problems. One paediatrician whom Baron saw was familiar with the work of the American doctor Leo Kanner and thought Timothy had a condition that was virtually unknown in the UK: autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kanner had described “classic autistic syndrome” in 1943, saying it was characterised by “a powerful desire for aloneness and sameness” a description that seemed to chime with Timothy’s behaviour. However, with zero provision for such children apart from psychiatric institutions, the outlook seemed bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron instinctively knew his son had a different way of looking at the world from other people and could not make sense of things or communicate what he needed. He was adamant that Timothy did not have a medical illness and nor was he “ineducable” as some doctors said. He was convinced that in the right educational setting Timothy could learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wanting to find out about autism, Baron joined the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children (the name for Mencap at the time). At a conference in 1961 he met other parents including fortuitously a young psychiatrist, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/22/lorna-wing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Lorna Wing&lt;/a&gt;, who was familiar with Kanner’s work and also had an autistic child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Keen to create an autism-specific charity, in January 1962, Baron, Wing and several other parents of autistic children met up for the first time. They initially called it the “Society for Psychotic Children” because so few in the UK understood the word “autism”, but Baron persuaded them it should be the National Society for Autistic Children. Later it became clear that autism does not stop at childhood and the society broadened its scope, changing its name in 1975 to the &lt;a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; (NAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the early 1960s Baron and Wing heard of a talented Montessori teacher, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sybil Elgar&lt;/a&gt;, who was teaching young children with learning disabilities in her home and had developed a structured approach to help them learn. They persuaded her to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron found premises in Ealing, west London, and in 1965 what would become known as the Sybil Elgar school opened with Timothy and Wing’s daughter, Susan, as two of its first pupils. Through Baron’s networking and articles in the media, public awareness of autism was growing, helped considerably one afternoon by a visit to the school by the Beatles, and John Lennon writing them a cheque for £1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9537196b-a270-4b97-9a80-5b97686d323e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Michael Baron at Crummock Water, near Buttermere, 2017. Previously he had campaigned against the poor disposal of nuclear waste in the Lake District.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Saskia Baron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Timothy spent his secondary school years in a boarding school in Northern Ireland, and as he approached 18, Baron worried about his future and that of other autistic adults who needed lifelong support. He discovered a large property for sale near Brent Knoll in Somerset and through the NAS raised funds, arranged its purchase and converted the house to have suitable accommodation for 21 residents. In 1974, &lt;a href="https://media.autism.org.uk/m/648d9a434534f858/original/First-Year-At-Somerset-Court.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Somerset Court&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s first autism-specific residential community opened, with Elgar as its first principal. Timothy was one of the first residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the decades, as autism was understood as a spectrum and an ever-wider number of people were diagnosed with it, Baron was concerned that vulnerable people like his son might get lost as NAS and society at large focused on the needs of higher-functioning autistic people. As Timothy and his contemporaries aged, it opened his eyes to the health and welfare needs of older severely autistic adults. In his 80s and 90s Baron campaigned for more learning disability nurses in the NHS and a wider understanding of welfare deputies, who could support disabled people if their family members were no longer around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1980 Baron was made an MBE for his services to autism. Speaking about him and his contemporaries in the 60s, Carol Povey, a former director of the Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt; at NAS, said: “That first generation of parents were formidable – a force of nature. They were admirable, fierce and so skilled at making change happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Born in Willesden, north-west London, Michael was the second son of Herbert, a lawyer, and Lily (nee Moses), a doctor. As well as his brother, Ronald, he had a younger sister, Margaret. From Westminster school, in 1948 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After graduating in 1951, Baron took the Law Society exams, became a solicitor in his father’s firm, and then set up his own offices in Twickenham, south-west London. He met Mie Wadsted, a Danish student who had come to London to improve her English, and they married in 1956. They had Timothy shortly afterwards, followed by two girls, Joanna and Saskia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron’s marriage ended in divorce in 1977, and three years later he married Hetty Thieme, a social worker. He sold his London firm in 1990 and the couple fulfilled a dream to move to the Lake District. There he became involved in a campaign to prevent the poor disposal of nuclear waste and took a passionate interest in local fauna such as bats and red squirrels. He had enjoyed literature and poetry all his life and helped to set up the literary festival &lt;a href="https://www.wordsbythewaterkeswick.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Words by the Water&lt;/a&gt; in Keswick, Cumbria. Towards the end of his life, in 2023, he took huge pride in seeing the publication of his poetry anthology &lt;a href="https://palewellpress.co.uk/bookstore/environment/ging/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Gingko Tree and Other Poems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2012 Hetty died and Baron moved back to London, living latterly with &lt;a href="https://communitylivingmagazine.com/exploring-puzzle-autism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his daughter Saskia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jan/15/familyandrelationships.features102" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;documentary film-maker&lt;/a&gt;, who in 2003 made &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/saskiabaron/20748434" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Autism Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His other daughter, Joanna, died in 2025.

&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus on the biological mechanisms underpinning &lt;strong&gt;sunburn&lt;/strong&gt; has remained largely unchanged for decades. The prevailing view posited that &lt;strong&gt;ultraviolet (UV) radiation&lt;/strong&gt; induces DNA mutations in skin cells, triggering inflammatory responses and initiating cell death to prevent carcinogenesis. This framework has shaped dermatological education, cancer research funding priorities, and public health messaging across high-UV index regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identified a different primary trigger. Through controlled experiments involving both murine and human epidermal models, the study demonstrated that the &lt;strong&gt;initial cellular response to UVB exposure is governed by RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt;, not DNA lesions. This distinction alters the molecular understanding of &lt;strong&gt;cutaneous inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; and raises new questions about the mechanisms of UV-induced cell signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have attracted growing attention from &lt;strong&gt;biomedical regulatory agencies&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;skin disease researchers&lt;/strong&gt; exploring alternative models of &lt;strong&gt;UV damage signaling&lt;/strong&gt;. In mouse models lacking the ZAK alpha kinase gene, a key regulator in ribosomal stress detection, typical UV-induced responses such as keratinocyte death and epidermal swelling were suppressed. This suggests that ZAK alpha’s activation by &lt;strong&gt;damaged messenger RNA (mRNA)&lt;/strong&gt; precedes and may override DNA-dependent pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RNA Damage as the Signal Origin&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core mechanism centers on what researchers described as the &lt;strong&gt;ribotoxic stress response (RSR)&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon UVB exposure, damaged mRNA triggers ZAK alpha to initiate inflammatory signaling and programmed cell death. “We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to UV radiation is damage to the RNA,” said Simon Bekker-Jensen, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Copenhagen, “and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-1200x1200.jpeg.webp" alt="Zak Knockout Mice" class="wp-image-117964" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-scaled.jpeg.webp 1200w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-420x420.jpeg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-160x160.jpeg.webp 160w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-520x520.jpeg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RNA damage from UV-B activates ZAKα, triggering a stress response in skin cells. The pathway leads to cytokine production, cell death (via JNK and p38), and inflammation. In mouse models, wild-type mice showed typical sunburn responses—immune cell infiltration and epidermal thickening—while ZAKα knockout mice did not, confirming ZAKα’s key role in mediating UV-induced skin inflammation. Credit: Molecular Cell Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In knockout mice lacking the &lt;strong&gt;ZAK gene&lt;/strong&gt;, those acute inflammatory markers were notably absent. In vitro tests using cultured human keratinocytes revealed the same pathway activation: &lt;strong&gt;RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt; activated pyroptotic and apoptotic death via the &lt;strong&gt;p38&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JNK&lt;/strong&gt; signaling routes, respectively. This dual-pathway activation reinforces the premise that ZAK alpha governs &lt;strong&gt;early UV stress responses&lt;/strong&gt; through cytoplasmic signals rather than nuclear genome surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Friction Point: Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Textbook Realignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate friction point is conceptual and infrastructural. &lt;strong&gt;Sunscreen formulations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UV protection protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;dermatological interventions&lt;/strong&gt; have historically been modeled around DNA-centric assumptions. The shift toward RNA-first mechanisms compels a reevaluation of &lt;strong&gt;photoimmunology models&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly for inflammatory conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;polymorphic light eruption&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;UV-aggravated eczema&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ZAK alpha’s role as a molecular sentinel introduces both &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic markers&lt;/strong&gt;. Potential pharmaceutical interventions that modulate the RSR pathway may offer new methods for &lt;strong&gt;controlling UV-induced skin inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, independent of mutagenic &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/chernobyls-dogs-are-transforming-at-record-speed-what-radiation-is-really-doing-to-their-dna/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97247" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA repair processes&lt;/a&gt;. However, these applications remain theoretical; as of January 2026, no ZAK alpha inhibitors have entered clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by faculty at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with NTU’s &lt;em&gt;Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, indicates a broader need for academic and medical reassessment. Assistant Professor Anna Constance Vind, a co-author of the study, noted, “This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educational and clinical materials reliant on DNA-centric inflammation models will likely need revision to include the role of RNA and ribosomal stress pathways. Key areas of impact include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical curricula&lt;/strong&gt; covering dermatology, cell signaling, and photobiology&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textbooks and training programs&lt;/strong&gt; for dermatologists and general practitioners&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; involving inflammatory skin responses to UV&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug discovery pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; targeting early UV damage detection and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this RNA-centric model applies uniformly across skin types, UV spectrum ranges, and environmental exposure durations remains under investigation. The interaction between &lt;strong&gt;long-term DNA mutations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;acute RNA signaling&lt;/strong&gt; is also unresolved; they may operate on separate timelines, with independent but complementary biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
