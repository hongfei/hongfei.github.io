    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study of nearly 5million adults ages 20 to 49, men living with NAFLD were also 17 percent more likely than women to be struck by colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers tied this to men being more likely to smoke and be obese, risk factors for liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the study, they said: 'Our findings revealed a strong link between NAFLD and early-onset CRC in young adults, suggesting the importance of implementing effective preventive strategies, particularly in populations with a growing burden of metabolic dysfunction.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;colorectal cancer surges in young Americans&lt;/a&gt;, with rates in under-50s increasing from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people in the last two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1542356525003441"&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated 4.6million adults in South Korea ages 20 to 49 from a South Korean insurance database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 2,733 developed early-onset colorectal cancer after an average of nine years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant underwent routine health checks in 2009 and was followed until 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were grouped into four categories: NAFLD, borderline NAFLD or no NAFLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver is diagnosed through a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 11 percent were diagnosed with NAFLD, 19 percent were borderline and 70 percent had no history of the condition. Participants in the NAFLD group tended to be older and male, smokers and mild-to-moderate drinkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also tended to have a higher BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure, all risk factors for liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking risk factors into account, patients&lt;span&gt; with NAFLD had a 24 percent increased risk of developing early colon cancer, and those in the borderline NAFLD group had a 12 percent higher chance compared to people without the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And of those with NAFLD, men were 17 percent more likely than women to develop colorectal cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As well as men living generally unhealthier lives, the researchers suggested the gender divide could be because the female sex hormone estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and protect against inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smoking, a risk factor for NAFLD, is also more common in men, and women are more likely to eat non-inflammatory fruits and vegetables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD patients in their 20s were also 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people in their 30s and 11 percent more likely than patients in their 40s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The likelihood of developing colon cancer was also 18 percent greater for non-diabetics compared to people with diabetes, leading the experts to suggest NAFLD may be a better indicator of colon cancer risk than diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide clinical evidence supporting a correlation between NAFLD and early-onset CRC.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team suggested NAFLD and early-onset colorectal cancer could be connected through shared 'inflammatory pathways.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professional baseball player Trey Mancini, pictured here with wife Sara, was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer at age 28, despite having no symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NAFLD often develops silently, causing inflammation and eventially permanent scarring of the liver (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of fatty liver disease can be difficult to notice at first, other than fatigue. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as swelling, red palms, and jaundice appear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD creates inflammation that damages cell DNA and causes cells to rapidly replicate, increasing the risk of cancerous cells forming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the researchers, chronic liver inflammation also releases cytokines - signaling proteins that communicate with the immune system - which promote the growth of cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAFLD also disrupts the function of bile acids, which leads to imbalances in the gut microbiome, a risk factor for colorectal cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, NAFLD raised the risk of tumors specifically in the lower left side of the colon and the rectum, suggesting the condition targets lower areas of the colon and rectum, though the exact mechanism is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including a lack of data on family history, colon cancer stage and colonoscopy history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These findings highlight the need for multifaceted preventive strategies, including lifestyle interventions and expanded screening for younger populations with NAFLD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 02:43:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQUUJqXzEtWEFYWTlVcHpXS3VGZW1YYktseGpCb0praU50U2Zjd2lPV3dJcVhyT1BKY0wtV2FVX1FOWThsYUpTdWF5cnBDVFoxRFJrcHVrbWhrWFpiWmhHbTNWVVVsZFZwX2Y0VVFUWlA3UDczYXotOE1md0szMHhpSWJoeVlkQS1KdUhEbFVWMXQ5dnJQNWs2YmdXVGlXMHRpVUJnOGItTGJyZEg4TDBj0gG0AUFVX3lxTFByaGg0SVFkbHMxQnpnLXI1NHJnX0o3bDctMGhWTjE4LU5KVVdiYy1CaW42U2d1dThxT2drUU9pVU5yRzlKaUNVQ0ZfNW5RVC1lMVhSNkU4emFpVDZVaVVKSDA0c0tDWW9UeXRnR2ZYdlVJcmRtQjI3OGpUVWphVzFuM3ZzN21iZzZkaHNhN04zQjdFU2dCS3k3Ti14ZzBYX0V1UWI4NVVKMUU4b1BFUVN3NFQ2RQ</guid></item><item><title>加拿大麻疹游客访问了斯诺霍米什县King的十几个地点- KOMO | Canadian tourist with measles visited over a dozen locations in King, Snohomish counties - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgJBVV95cUxOVmhMQnVudG9RVGF0MWQwT2Vocmd4Q3QwR3Y4RkZ0UUJnTXhyeWtMX3pTMXQwVS10T3pTenNkM1NSOXUxVzlrNVF3WEVyWjVuQmZzb0tUbWtVbzE4TGd1ZUF3akttZ3k2bWh1WE1tN2I3QXJCNEZGOUR5djZVc0tIajkzYXhLeXlGSE14bDk3RTM3VzltU20zXy1kU1NEcWJRNVlSdEFjUTE2M0Y2ZWJzeHMwbEozT0NnU05URWx3SUl3NlZtQUhHdG9Tc1BfYm91UnlpcHRDVlRud0FSYjJLTnIzYUJ4YTFZaWpZVTJZQ1pCZXRObEh4M0Z5ZFlEUmRDblBTRjliaWxTZUk1NlZtbVdtMUY3MEczV2ZzVG9wbXJkOUsyOEw2d3NFYWlaMHlXVVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" target="_blank" title="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Public Health – Seattle and King County&lt;/a&gt; is warning the public after a Canadian resident visited over a dozen locations in King and Snohomish counties while infectious with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health agency said the Canadian resident spent time in western Washington between April 30 and May 3 and visited “multiple public locations in Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett and Woodinville while contagious with measles, but before being diagnosed with measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the person’s vaccine status is unknown, and this case is not connected to any previous local measles cases. Measles can spread before a rash appears and people know they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" target="_blank" title="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;According to Public Health – Seattle and King County&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian resident visited the 16 locations listed below. The times listed include the estimated time the person was at the location and two hours after since the measles virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most residents in western Washington are immune to the disease through vaccination. According to Public Health – Seattle and King County, anyone who visited the locations above during the listed times and is not immune to measles will “most likely” become sick between May 7 – 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Globally and in the U.S., we are experiencing a significant measles resurgence. With over 1,000 cases reported so far this year nationally, 2025 is on track to have the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since the early 1990s,” said Meagan Kay, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. “It’s an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren’t protected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory disease.  The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The virus causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one person has measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County said up to nine out of 10 people nearby will also become infected if they’re not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can begin between seven to 21 days after exposure. The virus is contagious from around four days before a rash appears through four days after it appears, and the virus can be spread before the “characteristic measles rash” appears, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine because it's been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/09/measles-qa-with-dr-james-lewis-and-dr-alice-tin/" target="_blank" title="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/09/measles-qa-with-dr-james-lewis-and-dr-alice-tin/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Click here for more information and frequently asked questions about measles on the Public Health – Seattle and King County website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 00:26:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgJBVV95cUxOVmhMQnVudG9RVGF0MWQwT2Vocmd4Q3QwR3Y4RkZ0UUJnTXhyeWtMX3pTMXQwVS10T3pTenNkM1NSOXUxVzlrNVF3WEVyWjVuQmZzb0tUbWtVbzE4TGd1ZUF3akttZ3k2bWh1WE1tN2I3QXJCNEZGOUR5djZVc0tIajkzYXhLeXlGSE14bDk3RTM3VzltU20zXy1kU1NEcWJRNVlSdEFjUTE2M0Y2ZWJzeHMwbEozT0NnU05URWx3SUl3NlZtQUhHdG9Tc1BfYm91UnlpcHRDVlRud0FSYjJLTnIzYUJ4YTFZaWpZVTJZQ1pCZXRObEh4M0Z5ZFlEUmRDblBTRjliaWxTZUk1NlZtbVdtMUY3MEczV2ZzVG9wbXJkOUsyOEw2d3NFYWlaMHlXVVE</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们在20世纪60年代那么瘦？营养学家揭示过去的减肥秘诀-每日邮报 | Why were we so skinny in the 1960s?

Above, sunbathers sit in deckchairs at Virginia Beach in the 1960s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first driving factor behind the rise in obesity is the decline in home-cooked, fresh meals. These used to be the rule; not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They traditionally featured 'some type of really high quality protein, some fruit, some bread, some veggies and then probably milk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains this same nutritious formula applied to children's packed lunches for school, so kids were getting more of a balanced diet compared to today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was little mention of fast food, which has seen a surge in serving sizes - with calorie counts reaching nearly 2,000 for a serving of popular burgers and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From personal interactions with her family, she said in a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZTVRXivdVY"&gt; YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;: 'My dad said that they would pretty much always have like pot roast and my mom has a very specific, not fond, memory of lima [or butter] beans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates says the benefits of meals prepared at home include a lower sugar intake, extra protein and an increased amount of vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previous study from Johns Hopkins University found people who frequently cook their meals at home tend to consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat compared to those who don't cook as often. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, Ms Bates says another reason why today's society is fatter than ever is because of the explosion of ultra processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra processed foods, or UPFs, is an umbrella term used to cover anything with a long ingredients list or made with artificial additives like colorings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready meals, ice cream and ketchup are some of the most-loved examples of products that fall under the UPF term, now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why UPFs are bad, she says: 'Ultra processed is the next level of processing that really strips down the satiety and make you so much less satisfied from your food and therefore [you] need to eat even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are foods that are primarily going to have ingredients that you don't recognize and typically a long list of ingredients that you would not be able to just get your grocery store and recreate at home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates says it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans' diet today is made up of UPFs and 'some studies have found that these ultra processed foods can make us eat about 800 calories more a day because they are so much less satisfying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates (pictured above) reveals that in the 1960s America had an obesity rate of around 13 percent but today that number has more than tripled, with it now ballooning at 43 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates advises avoiding the fattening impact of these foods and swap them out for healthier alternatives - packaged snacks with added ingredients can be swapped for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continues: 'A large portion of the workforce back then had more physically demanding jobs. They also had a lot less structured activity, meaning that they didn't really work out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My dad will always say that he was super embarrassed when he was younger because his dad was a health nut at the time and would go for runs and his friends would make fun of him and ask what he was running from because people had more active jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They had a full day where they were more active versus a full day of sitting in front of a computer screen and then also probably commuting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bates notes with the rise of technology, people have become more housebound and glued to their screens, so they are getting less physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'My mom said that if you had to stay inside, that was a punishment when she was a kid. Kids back in the 60s really didn't have anything inside that would entertain them as much, so they had to go outside and be active and play.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people who have computer based jobs, Ms Bates suggests getting a walking desk, so you can walk on a treadmill while you type and keep trim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of this, she recommends three to four days of structured exercise per week, such as strength training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Ms Bates points to a lack of sleep as another problem driving America's obesity epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today the average American adult gets around 7 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night and successful modern day individuals like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and President Donald Trump have claimed that 4 hours is the optimal amount of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This compares to the 1960s, when studies show the average was closer to 8.5 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on this shift in sleeping patterns, Ms Bates says: 'Less sleep is significantly tied with obesity and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Low sleep causes increased hunger hormones so you're going to feel a lot more hungry the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also increases our preferences for sweet foods and it increases our preferences for larger portion sizes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritionist blames technology for hampering peoples' ability to sleep, with more distractions at nighttime in the form of things such as laptops, TVs and phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'Plus people were more active throughout the day which meant that they were more tired and actually did want to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to set bed times again for ourselves because there are so many different temptations to stay up late whether it be like binge watching a Netflix show or just scrolling on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to actually set time limits for when we're going to be going to sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 23:56:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOdFhFUThlSHFNM2FzUUZxZ3JsRVptMTJDbXdEWl94MU5iYzJjcnc5UktybUxTSWRqQjQ3Wm15N2JCWnJ0ZmdULU5UTDd1V2RmWEsyRFpfeG9NU1liNW1MS0dxT1dGbDBYV3NSMUJHWkV6S0tyY0ZfTDhCUFZiUlVYVzJEbnE2MklMYzFfc0VwZUU2TkFjYW81VEJYUWZQZnc4N0tGQlVrUU8xYWfSAbABQVVfeXFMUHJyTlpxZk9Xa2tSTWUwZ1lmc1RfUzN4N0JYN3dkdDJ2el9INGtJa3pVSWVZbEdTaUpCblVDWXRyTmxlRUdzb1c3X3hsV2Vock84TVF2M0w3azM0OERYNnVaZkt0a0hubjJ0bTJfLVhjdGRhenUxZE5DQkpGeGVqdjhMcDhNTm5OM1Q5RU9JQTlobjZTZUVBY3NfVU5MYWh0SHRCa0xFNGhaMGFmMzFsSlM</guid></item><item><title>模仿胃旁路手术的“黄金时代”减肥药被誉为“奇迹” -据说比-每日邮报 | 'Golden age' weight-loss pill that mimics gastric bypass op is hailed a 'miracle' - and said to be better than - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pill that mimics the effect of a gastric bypass has been touted as the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-94267480-3015-11f0-bfb9-b1b1020dc83a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; miracle – and may even be more effective than fat jabs in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, &lt;a target="_self" href="/galleries/article-13336623/All-surprising-health-benefits-Ozempic.html"&gt;including having fewer side effects and being easier to take&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also far safer and less invasive than actual gastric bypass surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rahul Dhanda, chief executive of Syntis Bio, makers of the pill, said: ‘The problem is [fat jabs] are not very tolerable and patients want to come off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘You want to have a long-term maintenance therapy, and an oral pill is the rational choice because it’s simple, tolerable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What we’re seeing now is patients and clinics being more focused on having something safe and sustainable to keep on a manageable, sustainable weight-loss path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I anticipate the side effects to be minimal to none, and we haven’t seen any yet in human tests. That is because it doesn’t enter the bloodstream like injections do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s a mechanical molecule, so it’s like we’re inserting a stent, as opposed to a drug that is acting with the target, and also off the target.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By binding to the mucous membrane lining of the duodenum - the top of the intestine near the stomach - the pills create a barrier that stops calories being absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forces food directly into the lower part of the digestive system, the pills set off a ‘cascade’ of hormones including GLP-1, the same chemical mimicked by semaglutide jab Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also causes the body to stop producing ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry, and start producing leptin, which makes you feel satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person taking the pill feels full more quickly and stops eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The coating created by the pill sheds naturally after about 24 hours, leaving no trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect is similar to gastric bypass, in which surgeons make the stomach smaller and shorten the small intestine, changing how the body absorbs food and leaving people feeling fuller after eating less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rats, the drug caused the animals to lose 1 per cent of their bodyweight per week while preserving 100 per cent of their lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials in humans have not studied weight loss but found the pills cause no harmful side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they prove effective in further trials, the pills could help patients maintain a healthy weight after intensive weight-loss with jabs, or replace the injections entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louis Aronne of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City told the conference that a 'golden age' of treatment had begun with these new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/golden-age-of-medicine-weight-loss-drugs-seen-as-key-to-longer-life-3wblnx3j6"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; reported he was pushing for health providers, including the NHS, to 'roll them out at scale', addding: 'I think use of drugs like this will prevent the need for many other medications, procedures, and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are just beginning to see in how many ways they can help.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 22:50:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxQMGpPN1VtWDR4bmpocVJWcUVSLWNodW9aY1Uxd2d0YlN5VWtCemlCZXMtYWE3VW1WTmtMZnpvN2U5NU96R3RjamctcTJMQ0lnNi10dzdmZ3JuNktGT0Nkb1NFbHllRzJwQk9aaXZZQWNFYlhvWjV6RHlTbTA0VkpGX2x3SmF3UjdSam1ZSzBEci1xc1JfcC1IRUZTY2VVejRMbEZxOHowamVvQ3BXVnJ5OUkyRC1RNUVPMjJ0WHhsWEt4TzlCU1B4U1dQWGppQ2lqTUVGal9FSlBoUDlqUlHSAeMBQVVfeXFMTTJveXBoMDg5ejlFcm1LclNTRGNYMWUzXzhOWTRmWW5YdWYwRnVvNWRyc1dNVGlVdk4xcWl5Nmc3TUljdzZoVTUzMncwRUoxaVJvX2E0dzJmYW5OSEI4aFlaOUdPV21YeG55U3hobHRSRWp1dG5vSUlGRGl1VmxJZHpLTWNTeW1UTVhRcFY1aTZpNXE0bFE3VlhpaVhWRlJDdXpXS2RNWURKQTgwem5XNm5rS2RyQ1JTZGwxcWZTWVZmTkNneEtNTmh4NURSWDdhQ1plVDdPNE9RWWNsSVZkZTF1c0E</guid></item><item><title>长时间工作？新研究表明，这可能会改变你的大脑结构- CNN | Working long hours?

            Long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/09/success/work-culture-9-to-5-curious-consumer"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; might not just be bad for you, they could also be altering the structure of your brain, a new study suggests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya0008356muuur2vy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2025/05/08/oemed-2025-110057" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday, found “significant changes” in the brains of people who were overworking, which is a combination of physical and emotional overexertion, as well as a lack of rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya0009356m2wbnhb8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research was conducted by two scientists at South Korea’s Chung-Ang University and Yonsei University, who followed 110 healthcare workers classified into “overworked” and “non-overworked” groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000a356md6no8rzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Korea, where 52 hours of work per week is the legal upper limit, overworking has become &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6620743/" target="_blank"&gt;a public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000b356mzotb81sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overworked group, clocking 52 hours or more each week, consisted of 32 people who were on average younger, in employment for less time and more highly educated in comparison to those working standard hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000c356mug6owkyr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By comparing data from a different study and MRI scans, the researchers were able to use a neuroimaging technique to analyse the workers’ brain volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000d356m4qcts19f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The technique allowed them to identify and compare differences in levels of gray matter in different regions of the brain, while the application of atlas-based analysis meant they could identify and label structures in brain scans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000e356m18f4j7t8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who worked 52 or more hours a week displayed significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation, unlike participants who worked standard hours,” researchers said in a press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000f356m8q4b14px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Areas of the brain that showed an increase in volume include the middle frontal gyrus, which plays a major role in cognitive functions, attention, memory and language-related processes, as well as the insula, which is involved in emotional processing, self-awareness and understanding social context.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000g356mptrml15a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers believe their findings suggest a “potential relationship” between having an increased workload and changes in these parts of the brain, providing a biological basis for the cognitive and emotional challenges reported by people who are overworked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000h356mhae9cxgb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Joon Yul Choi, coauthor of the study and an assistant professor at Yonsei University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, told CNN that these changes might be “at least in part, reversible” if environmental stressors are reversed. Still, returning to your brain’s baseline state could take much longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Previous research has also found evidence of the negative health impacts of long working hours. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/17/success/who-long-hours-intl-scli-wellness"&gt;joint research&lt;/a&gt; from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that overworking led to more than 745,000 deaths in a year. Long hours have also been found to raise the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/health/diabetes-long-hours-women-study"&gt;diabetes in women&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/169/5/596/143020?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;decline in cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000k356milxe0w01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While these behavioral and psychological consequences of overwork are well-known, the underlying neurological mechanisms and changes in anatomy are less understood, the study explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000l356m2jegopb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank Pega, who led the WHO-ILO 2021 study, told CNN that these latest findings constitute “important new evidence” that could help better understand how long working hours “radically” impact the physical health of workers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamfciya000m356mphkict47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pega, a WHO technical officer who was not involved in this latest study, said the research supports WHO-ILO’s findings that “long working hours contribute the largest burden of disease of all occupational risk factors identified so far.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            However, the study’s small sample size and focus only on healthcare workers in South Korea makes it hard to generalize its results. “More studies in different populations are needed,” said Pega.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “While the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study, they represent a meaningful first step in understanding the relationship between overwork and brain health,” said the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Governments, employers, and workers can all take actions to protect workers’ health from long working hours,” advised Pega, citing laws, regulations and policies that can ensure healthy work hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Jonny Gifford, principal research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies in Brighton, England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the research “confirms some physiological reasons that working long hours affects our wellbeing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The use of brain scanning equipment to give neurological explanations gives powerful new evidence linking overwork with structural changes in parts of the brain involved in executive function and emotional regulation,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s a small study of 110 healthcare workers in Korea, but because it is based on robust neurological measures and concerns fundamental mechanisms (overwork and fatigue) that can affect anyone, the central findings are widely relevant,” Gifford added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed health data from over 142,000 adults and found that certain multimorbidity profiles more than doubled the chance of a depression diagnosis within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with joint or bone issues and individuals with chronic lung, liver, or bowel conditions were also at elevated risk.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Edinburgh used data from more than 142,000 people in the UK Biobank study to examine how physical illnesses interact to influence the risk of depression – a condition that often goes underdiagnosed in people managing long-term physical diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were aged 37-73 years and had at least one chronic physical condition but no history of depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists used statistical clustering techniques to group individuals by their physical illness profiles and tracked how these clusters related to later diagnoses of depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group, which included people experiencing the highest rates of physical illness also showed the highest risk of developing depression. This group had no single dominant illness, but rather a complex mix of issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with both heart disease and diabetes were also found to be at high risk, as were those with chronic lung conditions like asthma or COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Liver and bowel conditions also showed a noticeable link to depression in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the highest-risk groups, about one in 12 people developed depression over the next 10 years, compared with about one in 25 people without physical conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the biological burden of illness may play a role, researchers say social and systemic factors could also help explain why physical multimorbidity leads to worse mental health outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren DeLong, lead author and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said: “We saw clear associations between physical health conditions and the development of depression, but this study is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our findings inspire other researchers to investigate and untangle the links between physical and mental health conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice at the University of Edinburgh’s Advanced Care Research Centre, said: “Healthcare often treats physical and mental health as completely different things, but this study shows that we need to get better at anticipating and managing depression in people with physical illness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR’s Scientific Director of Innovation, said: “Harnessing the power of data to understand the impact of chronic conditions is going to transform the way we treat patients in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NIHR’s research in this area is helping to paint a full picture of what patients are dealing with, rather than just focusing on one health condition at a time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this health and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a4b6baeda2b7a8aaadb0acad83a6a7eda2a0edb6a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guy Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Guy Atkinson – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-00825-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Lauren DeLong et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more conditions within an individual, is a growing challenge for health and care delivery as well as for research. Combinations of physical and mental health conditions are highlighted as particularly important. Here, we investigated associations between physical multimorbidity and subsequent depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a clustering analysis upon physical morbidity data for UK Biobank participants aged 37–73. Of 502,353 participants, 142,005 had linked general practice data with at least one baseline physical condition. Following stratification by sex (77,785 women; 64,220 men), we used four clustering methods and selected the best-performing based on clustering metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Fisher’s Exact test to determine significant over-/under-representation of conditions within each cluster. Amongst people with no prior depression, we used survival analysis to estimate associations between cluster-membership and time to subsequent depression diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-modes models perform best, and the over-/under-represented conditions in the resultant clusters reflect known associations. For example, clusters containing an overrepresentation of cardiometabolic conditions are amongst the largest (15.5% of whole cohort, 19.7% of women, 24.2% of men).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cluster associations with depression vary from hazard ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.85–1.98) to 2.67 (2.24–3.17), but almost all clusters show a higher association with depression than those without physical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that certain groups of physical multimorbidity may be associated with a higher risk of subsequent depression. However, our findings invite further investigation into other factors, such as social considerations, which may link physical multimorbidity with depression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 22:14:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBLVnRDVTlpRi1KRENpX3k4ZTNaU2oyNGt3YlNSaTBoUlNLdE40eWVINmhwbVB6UVhmNm5xa3FHdTB5TUhUQWs0ZDM4SVNBX1lBWmlrdHNXVnJKZ3lXM09YY255aG82Q2luYkdFTEc2Zw</guid></item><item><title>大脑如何将声音与意义联系起来-神经科学新闻 | How the Brain Links Sound to Meaning - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBnSHFuYW9MVTZqV2Z5QmlnMnF2M2Y4eHBoeEhxZVc3ZWdCSk83MDNCeU9uRTREajFzOS1nZkVVS2kyQWhUN0FxUUtLUFVXOWdlQU9CZEdTeWZuX3NDMzVEbDlnQ01kLVU2TEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has mapped how the brain retrieves words during speech, identifying two distinct but overlapping networks in the prefrontal cortex. Researchers used high-resolution electrocorticography in 48 patients to reveal that semantic processing and articulatory planning occur in neighboring yet functionally distinct regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key discovery was the involvement of a dorsal prefrontal hub in mapping sound to meaning, particularly in natural auditory naming tasks. These findings could improve treatment for language disorders and support future innovations in brain-computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Word retrieval relies on separate semantic and articulatory networks in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditory Specialization:&lt;/strong&gt; A dorsal hub links sound to meaning—crucial for spoken language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may guide therapies for speech disorders and brain-computer communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are we able to recall a word we want to say? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basic ability, called word retrieval, is often compromised in patients with brain damage. Interestingly, many patients who can name words they see, like identifying a pet in the room as a “cat”, struggle with retrieving words in everyday discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain retrieves words during speech. A new study by researchers at New York University sheds light on this mystery, revealing a left-lateralized network in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that plays a crucial role in naming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, provide new insights into the neural architecture of language, offering potential applications for both neuroscience and clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Brain’s Naming Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word retrieval is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing us to link concepts to language. Despite decades of research, the exact neural dynamics underlying this process — particularly in natural auditory contexts — remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYU researchers — led by Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Leyao Yu and Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Tandon and Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Adeen Flinker — recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 48 neurosurgical patients to examine the spatial and temporal organization of language processing in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using unsupervised clustering techniques, the researchers identified two distinct but overlapping networks responsible for word retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, a semantic processing network, was located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was engaged in integrating meaning and was sensitive to how surprising a word was within a given sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second, an articulatory planning network, was situated in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which played a crucial role in speech production, regardless of whether words were presented visually or auditorily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditory Naming and the Prefrontal Cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds upon decades of work in language neuroscience. Previous research suggested that different regions of the brain were responsible for retrieving words depending on whether they were seen or heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, earlier studies relied on methods with limited temporal resolution, leaving many unanswered questions about how these networks interact in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of ECoG, the researchers uncovered a striking ventral-dorsal gradient in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that while articulatory planning was localized ventrally, semantic processing was uniquely represented in a dorsal region of the inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus — a previously underappreciated hub for language processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that a missing piece in our understanding of language processing lies in this dorsal prefrontal region,” explains lead author Leyao Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides the first direct evidence that this area is involved in mapping sounds to meaning in an auditory context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Neuroscience and Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has far-reaching implications, not only for theoretical neuroscience but also for clinical applications. Language deficits, such as anomia — the inability to retrieve words — are common in stroke, brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the precise neural networks involved in word retrieval could lead to better diagnostics and targeted rehabilitation therapies for patients suffering from these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study provides a roadmap for future research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By decoding the neural signals associated with naming, scientists could potentially develop assistive devices for individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively through direct brain-computer communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, one thing is clear: our ability to name the world around us is not just a simple act of recall, but the result of a sophisticated and finely tuned neural system — one that is now being revealed in greater detail than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this auditory neuroscience and language research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97fbf2f6ffb9e4f4fffaf2e5fbd7f9eee2b9f2f3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Schmerl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Schmerl – NYU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming&lt;/a&gt;” by Leyao Yu et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this process relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded neurosurgical electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space, critical for word retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was invariant to input modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the processing of semantic auditory inputs ranging from passive language comprehension to conversational speech.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 21:18:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBnSHFuYW9MVTZqV2Z5QmlnMnF2M2Y4eHBoeEhxZVc3ZWdCSk83MDNCeU9uRTREajFzOS1nZkVVS2kyQWhUN0FxUUtLUFVXOWdlQU9CZEdTeWZuX3NDMzVEbDlnQ01kLVU2TEE</guid></item><item><title>研究将异常体验与潜意识联系和其他心理特征联系起来- PsyPost | Study links anomalous experiences to subconscious connectedness and other psychological traits - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFdJeXJBdEJxLWh6SmNCSjBYUmlVeXUzZFJxSzQ4R0tnY1gxWkhfQkZ3RHJDREdTeFBRaFVsWnk4Vkl0cUhaR2gyTDFnX1RQRDkzUWpvaVlXRnprcHpFRkJ3UG9KaFBoV0p3U0FSa2FYRE1LeEhGZmhYQXcyM1F0YUtCTEpkMzYtbWNJcE5QZlBHQ1RWWm10a3pSU0ktTWxmMU9OQ3dpdy1BYVc5M2xMWVVhYXhWd3hkU3Bv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new series of studies suggests that unusual experiences like premonitions, déjà vu, and out-of-body sensations are not rare, but instead quite common—and that people who report them often share distinct psychological traits. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-07062-001?doi=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that individuals high in a trait called subconscious connectedness were significantly more likely to report frequent anomalous experiences. These experiences were also associated with traits such as dissociation, magical thinking, absorption, and intuitive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anomalous experiences are events that seem to go beyond what conventional science can explain. These include extrasensory perceptions, vivid or unusual dreams, perceived telepathic events, or an unexplained sense of presence. While such experiences are often dismissed as illusions or signs of mental illness, some researchers argue that they are widespread in the general population and deserve more scientific attention. The new study was designed to better understand what kinds of people are more likely to report such experiences and how those experiences might be related to underlying psychological traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been formally studying the personality trait of subconscious connectedness for several years. It is a line of research that indicates that some people have a much closer connection with the non-conscious or subconscious parts of their mind than other people; meaning that their consciousness and their subconscious mind influence each other to an unusually high degree in their everyday life,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/gi/people/olafur-s-palsson-psyd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Olafur S. Palsson&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be measured with a questionnaire called the Thought Impact Scale, which I developed and validated. By using scores on that scale, people can be reliably divided into those with high, moderate, and low subconscious connectedness. It is a personality characteristic that is normally distributed in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having high subconscious connectedness seems to be associated with a range of specific personal tendencies and behaviors, and I have been investigating those systematically in several studies,” Palsson explained. “These side effects, so to speak, of high subconscious connectedness include greater proneness to engage regularly in creative or artistic activities, higher hypnotizability and being more likely to seek hypnosis treatment, and greater probability of experiencing certain stress-related physical health problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and migraine headaches. A tendency to have a lot of unusual life experiences is another characteristic that I have long suspected to be associated with high subconscious connectedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anomalous experiences are a broad and heterogenous class of phenomena that simply have in common that they are things that people sometimes experience that are outside the conventional framework of understanding of how the world operates. I noticed many years ago that clients in my practice as a clinical psychologist who showed indications of high subconscious connectedness seemed to spontaneously report various anomalous experiences more commonly than my other clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, they more often described being able to sense the thoughts of other people, having predictive dreams, experiencing highly improbable and very meaningful synchronicities, or having out-of-body experiences,” Palsson continued. “This observation led me to conduct a series of three studies to examine whether greater proneness to anomalous experiences is indeed a side effect of having high subconscious connectedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson conducted three separate studies involving over 2,200 adults in the United States. The first study was a pilot involving 216 participants from a university community. The second and third studies were large, demographically balanced online surveys conducted with nationwide samples—500 people in Study 2 and 1,500 people in Study 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three studies used the newly developed Unusual Experiences Questionnaire, which asks people about 13 types of anomalous experiences and how often they occur. Examples include sensing someone is watching you before you turn around, having predictive dreams, or noticing meaningful coincidences that seem too unlikely to be chance. The team also used the Thought Impact Scale to assess the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson found that people with high subconscious connectedness reported more anomalous experiences than those with low scores on the Thought Impact Scale. In all three studies, the difference between high and low scorers was not just statistically significant—it was large. For example, in the nationally representative Study 3, people with high Thought Impact Scale scores reported, on average, more than three times as many repeated anomalous experiences as those with low scores. In fact, 86% of participants in that survey said they had experienced at least one of the anomalous events more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between Thought Impact Scale scores and the amount of anomalous experiences was moderate to strong across all three studies (r = .53 to .69). Moreover, every single one of the 13 experiences listed in the Unusual Experiences Questionnaire was more common among people with high subconscious connectedness—ranging from déjà vu to feeling their thoughts had influenced other people’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was to see how many adults have certain anomalous experiences again and again,” Palsson told PsyPost. “The most common of these repeated experiences was déjà-vu — that is, the sense that what one is experiencing in the present moment has happened before, when that is not possible. About sixty percent of people in the U.S. national population samples reported having had déjà-vu at least a few times. And between forty and fifty percent of all the people surveyed reported that they had at least a few times sensed correctly being stared at before looking, having had premonition that came true, and objects oddly disappearing and showing up later in places where they had already looked for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person having any such peculiar experience once can perhaps be dismissed as misperception or imagination. But to see that a large proportion of the general population experiences particular anomalies again and again over time is eye-opening to me, and suggests that these phenomena warrant far more research. Most surveys of anomalous experiences have unfortunately only asked whether people have ever experienced what is described, but not how often it occurs. That is a mistake, I think. For if some subjective experience happens repeatedly over time, it is a psychological tendency, and likely says something about the mind of the person who has that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But subconscious connectedness wasn’t the only trait linked to these experiences. In the first and third studies, Palsson also measured several other personality traits previously associated with anomalous experiences. These included absorption (becoming fully immersed in thoughts or sensory experiences), dissociation (feeling detached from oneself), fantasy proneness, faith in intuition, magical ideation (the belief that one’s thoughts can influence the world), and belief in paranormal phenomena. All of these traits showed significant associations with the number of anomalous experiences participants reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson also explored how these experiences relate to mental health and well-being. People who reported more anomalous experiences tended to report more stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. However, the correlations were modest. The number of anomalous experiences was only weakly related to lower happiness and had no clear relationship with perceived quality of life. These findings suggest that while unusual experiences may be more common in individuals with higher emotional distress, they are not necessarily impairing or distressing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic patterns also emerged. Across the two national surveys, younger adults reported more anomalous experiences than older adults. The highest prevalence was found in participants under 50 years old, while people over 65 reported the fewest. Some racial and ethnic differences were also found: in the third study, Black participants reported more anomalous experiences than white participants, while Hispanic participants fell in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are two important points that emerge from this work for the general public,” Palsson explained. “The first is that anomalous experiences are actually very common. They tend to be dismissed as exceptions or rare events, but the findings indicate that they are a normal part of human life experience. The series of three studies that I describe in the paper that was just published is the most comprehensive investigation carried out so far on anomalous experiences in the U.S. general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two of the studies were nationwide surveys of nationally representative samples of adults. Both of those population studies showed that about four out of every five American adults have at least one kind of anomalous experience repeatedly, and in fact, most of them have multiple different kinds of such odd experiences again and again. In my view, this suggests that having anomalous experiences is something that should be considered to be a part of our natural psychological makeup as human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second important takeaway from this research, I think, is that people vary greatly in regard to the extent to which they have odd life experiences,” Palssons said. “Proneness to have anomalous experiences is most likely a stable personal characteristic over time, and is probably determined in large part by how much people’s conscious and subconscious minds communicate with each other in everyday life. What this means is that if you are a person who frequently has anomalous experiences, and you have a friend who rarely or never has such experiences, that particular difference between you will probably still be there years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palsson cautions that while the findings are robust, they do not prove that subconscious connectedness causes anomalous experiences. It is possible that both are influenced by other underlying factors, or that people who are more open to experiences are simply more likely to notice or recall unusual events. Another limitation is that the Unusual Experiences Questionnaire does not cover all possible anomalous experiences—such as religious visions, communication with the dead, or UFO encounters—so the findings may not apply to those domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main limitation of this research is that I used a short questionnaire in the three survey studies to measure anomalous experiences,” Palsson noted. “It is therefore unclear whether the findings apply to all types of anomalous experiences. For example, we cannot know for sure whether seeing ghosts is related to being high on the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, because my surveys did not ask people whether or how often they have seen ghosts. However, because all thirteen types of anomalous experiences that were measured in my surveys showed a robust association with high subconscious connectedness, it seems likely that other such experiences are also more common for people with high scores on that trait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope their findings will encourage more scientific attention to these experiences and promote a better understanding of their psychological roots. Whether or not anomalous experiences reflect hidden aspects of reality or just the quirks of the human mind, they appear to be deeply woven into how many people experience the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I continue to actively pursue research to enhance understanding of the effects of having high, or low, subconscious connectedness,” Palsson said. “In regard to anomalous experiences, future studies will aim to examine what specific cognitive differences related to high subconscious connectedness result in proneness to have anomalous experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cns0000428" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Anomalous Experiences Are Associated With High Subconscious Connectedness&lt;/a&gt;,” was published April 17, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 21:15:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFdJeXJBdEJxLWh6SmNCSjBYUmlVeXUzZFJxSzQ4R0tnY1gxWkhfQkZ3RHJDREdTeFBRaFVsWnk4Vkl0cUhaR2gyTDFnX1RQRDkzUWpvaVlXRnprcHpFRkJ3UG9KaFBoV0p3U0FSa2FYRE1LeEhGZmhYQXcyM1F0YUtCTEpkMzYtbWNJcE5QZlBHQ1RWWm10a3pSU0ktTWxmMU9OQ3dpdy1BYVc5M2xMWVVhYXhWd3hkU3Bv</guid></item><item><title>居住在高尔夫球场附近与帕金森病之间的惊人联系- gizmodo.com | The Surprising Connection Between Living Near Golf Courses and Parkinson’s Disease - gizmodo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOVVJKbl96ZWdNS0thM1lkTjVQWXFzcERuMkpQQ1BSNWtSSGQxZm9ZR0MtS2VuN2w5US1oZ3ZTemN3UnJ6aEhaODhFTGhIZmk2ODM3dF9VVGI2eWlaWlh5RVhpRURyeVMtM01Zb0dIOHhhSDZwbVVXa1cxQW1GTEdYc3ZzeTRFMnY0TTFzMk9kd1ZmTGdrWFlEdkpUeHQ5M21qcE01clZ5cTdNcXdWUmhRdkVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;People may be paying a hidden price for living close to a golf course. Recent research has found a link between golf courses and greater odds of developing Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Mayo Clinic and others conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Network Open. They found that people who lived in close proximity to golf courses had a higher risk of Parkinson’s than similar residents who lived farther away. The researchers argue that the pesticides used to maintain these courses are likely a major reason behind the connection—an argument that other experts are taking seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This study is a wake-up call.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; is a neurodegenerative condition that progressively worsens people’s motor function (in the later stages, it &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/parkinsons-disease/parkinsons-disease-and-dementia#:~:text=Parkinson%20disease%20causes%20physical%20symptoms,it%20hard%20to%20maintain%20relationships."&gt;often affects cognition&lt;/a&gt; as well). It’s &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/about-us/news/2025-parkinsons-awareness-month"&gt;thought to affect nearly a million Americans&lt;/a&gt; today, with almost 100,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Most cases are thought to be caused by a complex mix of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/study-genetic-trigger-parkinsons-disease-african-1850871175"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; and environmental factors, which can include exposure to toxins like pesticides. Past studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722079542?via%3Dihub"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that living or working next to areas where pesticides are routinely applied is linked to a higher risk for Parkinson’s. But according to the study researchers, there hasn’t been much work done to understand the potential risk of living near golf courses specifically.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors used data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, established by the Mayo Clinic and others in 1966. The project has followed the health of residents in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin for many years, including whether they were ever diagnosed with Parkinson’s. They compared people in the project who were diagnosed with Parkinson’s between 1991 and 2015 to controls matched in age and sex, in what’s known as a case-control study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The closer that someone lived to one of the 139 golf courses located in the regions covered by the project (or who shared water services with a golf course), the more likely they were to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s, the researchers found. After accounting for other factors, they calculated that living within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of a golf course was associated with a 126% increase in risk of Parkinson’s compared to people who lived six or more miles (9 km) away. Residents who shared water services with a golf course also had almost twice the odds of developing Parkinson’s as those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is an important and well-designed population-based study that adds meaningful data to our growing understanding of environmental contributors to Parkinson’s disease,” Michael S. Okun, national medical advisor for the Parkinson’s Foundation, who is not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okun, who is also the director of the Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, cautions that this study cannot show a causative link between golf course proximity and a higher risk of Parkinson’s. But he notes that certain common pesticides, such as paraquat, maneb, and chlorpyrifos, are known to be toxic to the brain, and some research has linked their use to &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/blog/awareness/CSO-update"&gt;increased Parkinson’s cases&lt;/a&gt;. Since golf courses require “intensive chemical maintenance,” he adds, it’s biologically plausible that these chemicals can contaminate the local water supply or otherwise reach people in the surrounding area and raise their Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Svjetlana Miocinovic, an associate professor in the Department of Neurology at Emory University’s School of Medicine, also wasn’t surprised by the study’s results, though she notes that this shouldn’t be the last word on the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The study was done in one geographic region so results need to be replicated in a larger cohort and other geographic areas, but the study highlights the importance of environmental factors in Parkinson’s disease,” Miocinovic, who is not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While more work is needed to understand the exact risks posed by golf courses and accompanying pesticide use, Okun argues that we know enough to take action already by limiting people’s exposures to these chemicals whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study is a wake-up call,” he said. “Parkinson’s disease is the world’s fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder, and we are spending pennies on the dollar for prevention. The real takeaway here is that we need to stop viewing Parkinson’s as an inevitable consequence of aging and start treating it as a potentially preventable condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine experts are perplexed by a project the Trump administration has launched to develop a universal flu vaccine, which has long been a goal, though an elusive one, in medical research. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Gold Standard&lt;/a&gt;, the project is aimed at creating a flu shot that doesn't have to be updated every year to match the latest strains of the virus. The project also aims to produce a vaccine that could protect people against other respiratory viruses that could cause a pandemic, such as bird flu and coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift," said National Institutes of Heath Director Jay Bhattacharya in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the project. "It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats — not just today's, but tomorrow's as well — using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The announcement surprised vaccine researchers, given the anti-vaccine stance of health officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm glad to see that this administration is still wanting to invest in developing next-generation influenza vaccines or respiratory vaccines in general," says &lt;a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/florida/ross/" target="_blank"&gt;Ted Ross&lt;/a&gt;, director of Global Vaccine Development at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An old vaccine technology back in the spotlight&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Ross and other outside vaccine experts are mystified by many aspects of Generation Gold Standard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First of all, the project plans to use an approach that would involve injecting people with a whole flu virus that has been killed with a chemical to render it harmless but is still capable of stimulating the immune system. Most vaccine experts consider the whole killed virus approach to be antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This a head-scratcher to me. This is puzzling," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.atria.org/doctors/dr-gregory-a-poland/" target="_blank"&gt;Gregory Poland&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine expert who leads the Atria Academy of Science and Medicine in New York.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're going back to technology that was used 40, 50 years ago or more. So this is a little surprising to me why you would go backwards to this technology? It's a very old technology," Poland says. "This is what influenza vaccines in the 40s, 50s and 60s looked like."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Whole dead virus vaccines tend to produce more side effects, including high fevers and seizures that especially can frighten parents, Poland, Ross and others say. Newer, more advanced technologies are showing more promise with fewer side effects, they say. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccines. We have recombinant influenza vaccines. We have an mRNA-based influenza vaccine," Poland says. "So why would you put all your eggs in one basket?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A pricey bet on a single approach&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And then there's the price tag: $500 million, which is a huge amount, especially at a time when federal health research funding is being slashed. The money that was originally earmarked to help explore a variety of technologies for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This amount of money is astronomical. It is foolish to put that much money onto one technology," says &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/author/rick-bright" target="_blank"&gt;Rick Bright,&lt;/a&gt; a former federal vaccine expert who is now a private consultant. "What we need now is bold 21st century solutions, not a retreat into nostalgia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another aspect that's raising eyebrows is the fact that the technology — called a "beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform" — was developed by two NIH scientists — Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/matthew-j-memoli-md-ms" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Memoli&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. &lt;a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/jeffery-taubenberger" target="_blank"&gt;Jeffery Tautenberger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Memoli was recently named as the principal deputy director of the NIH after serving as Trump's acting NIH director. Tautenberger was recently named acting director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Tautenberger holds a &lt;a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11369675" target="_blank"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; on the technology. In addition, the strategy was picked without independent, public review and based on only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11779107/" target="_blank"&gt;very limited&lt;/a&gt; preliminary testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So that's odd," says Dr.  &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine expert who's now at Georgetown University. "If you're going to do this, have an open scientific competition for the best ideas. There should be transparency for the process of how to allot funding."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cost of the project and answered a question about the two vaccine candidates being explored, but didn't answer additional questions from NPR about the project, including why officials picked this approach and how the effort was vetted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in announcing it, the administration said a universal flu vaccine should be ready for widescale testing next year and could be available to the public within four years, which is a very ambitious timeline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed," the announcement says. "This approach ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Low-ranking male mice showed stronger reward signals and weaker control circuits, making them more prone to seek methamphetamine, while high-ranking mice had better balance and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the mesocortical “control” pathway through optogenetics reduced drug-seeking and improved social rank, suggesting experience-based changes can reshape addiction risk. Interestingly, these effects were sex-specific, with female mice showing drug-seeking behavior regardless of status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circuit Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low social rank is linked to stronger reward signals and weaker executive control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Winning experiences elevated social rank and reduced drug-seeking in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Findings:&lt;/strong&gt; Female addiction behavior was not influenced by social rank.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug addiction poses a global public health challenge, with limited therapeutic options and modest efficacy. While numerous studies have shown that social status profoundly impacts mental health and addiction susceptibility, its neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, however, a research team led by Prof. ZHU Yingjie from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed the neural mechanisms by which social rank influences vulnerability to drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109885"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a head and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-social-addiction-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on May 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a suite of cutting-edge neuroscience tools such as fiber photometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetic manipulation, and volumetric imaging, the researchers explored both functional and structural differences in the dopamine systems of male rodents occupying different social ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools allowed them to measure real-time neuronal activity, detect rapid chemical changes (particularly dopamine), manipulate neural circuits with light, and capture high-speed 3D images of brain activity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that an animal’s social rank influences its tendency to seek methamphetamine (METH) by affecting the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways—two key dopamine pathways in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic pathway delivers dopamine to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and promotes reward-seeking behavior, whereas the mesocortical pathway, which projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and supports executive control, helping suppress compulsive drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low-ranking mice exhibit a stronger ‘reward’ circuit and a weaker ‘control’ circuit —like a high-powered car with faulty brakes—making them more likely to seek drugs. In contrast, high-ranking mice have a more balanced system, with effective ‘brakes’ that help them resist addiction,” explained Prof. ZHU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dopamine-related proteins in the NAc of low-ranking male mice were reduced, their METH-seeking behavior declined. In contrast, when dopamine fibers in the mPFC of high-ranking male mice were damaged, drug-seeking behavior increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strikingly, activating the mesocortical dopamine pathway via optogenetic stimulation not only made the mice win a social competition test more often; it also made them much less likely to seek METH in subsequent trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the study also found that these effects were sex-specific: Female mice exhibited METH-seeking behavior regardless of social rank, suggesting different neurobiological underpinning of addiction risk in male and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that introducing winning experiences to low-ranking male mice not only elevated their social rank but also reduced later drug-seeking behavior. These behavioral changes were linked to functional and structural remodeling in both the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel neurobiological framework linking social status, dopamine circuit dynamics, and addiction vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By boosting an individual’s sense of social achievement or simulating successful experiences, it may be possible—at the neural level—to ‘strengthen the brakes and ease off the accelerator,’ thereby reducing addiction risk,” said Prof. ZHU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that the study also supports the development of non-invasive stimulation therapies aimed at reducing addiction vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and addiction research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5021253e7e3c2510233931247e31337e333e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LU Qun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://siat.ac.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;LU Qun – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01951-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways&lt;/a&gt;” by ZHU Yingjie et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social status has a profound impact on mental health and propensity towards drug addiction. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:26:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBvb0piRGk4RDhUbXBoQU5DN2ZlODExb1FteHppNXk1b256QmFEWmpYR0prNXA5Zno2dUZNamxidnVpNnA2TlBKNno1UmZ2QkszNlFSUlF6UVQ0ZFZSQl9SdzJvaU9VdkxRMVpyWGNIZGRCT3pi</guid></item><item><title>显著网络扩张可能是抑郁症的可靠生物标志物-神经科学新闻 | Salience Network Expansion May Be A Reliable Biomarker for Depression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE84SkNVTEtqX1FaSXo5UVd3ck9jeXpIWXhPc0k5c1ZZd2dFdGNPMzJiOTZVYWthZS1XTThmX204Z2lWYkVROUltREVBcUJnb0xOVWhwSENPNkw5cER3SDBKSmdNYXNOcVJlbEp4Yl9vY3o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A newly identified biomarker, an enlarged salience network in the brain, could dramatically change how depression is detected and treated. This network, responsible for regulating attention and switching between mental states, was found to be consistently larger in people with depression, regardless of symptom severity or treatment history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the expansion appears to predate the onset of symptoms, offering hope for early identification and intervention. Researchers propose that genetic predisposition, compensatory activity, or relative regional atrophy may underlie this expansion, with wide-reaching implications for future treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Neural Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Enlarged salience network appears before depressive symptoms and persists regardless of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Could allow pre-symptomatic identification of individuals at risk for depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Lens:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports rethinking depression as a disorder of network connectivity, not just neurotransmitter imbalance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Commentary published today, researchers have identified what could be the first reliable biomarker for depression risk, potentially transforming how this devastating condition is identified and treated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary examines recent findings demonstrating that individuals with depression consistently exhibit a functionally enlarged salience network compared to non-depressed controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="An Enlarged Brain Network May Predict Depression" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWtrYWVsc5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinctive Brain Connectivity Pattern Identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The salience network, a neural system responsible for attention allocation and switching between different brain networks, appears to be functionally twice as large in people with depression as in those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, highlighted in the commentary by researchers at the University of Ottawa and the University of California San Francisco, builds upon groundbreaking research published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; by Lynch et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery so significant is that the expanded salience network predates the onset of depressive symptoms and remains stable regardless of symptom severity or treatment interventions,” explained Dr. Nicholas Fabiano, co-author of the commentary from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re potentially looking at a distinctive neural signature that could identify individuals at risk for depression before they experience symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This characteristic brain connectivity pattern was observed consistently across individuals with depression, suggesting its potential as a depression biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The salience network, comprising the fronto-insular cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and temporal poles, plays a crucial role in reward processing and regulating the switch between the default mode network and frontoparietal network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Early Identification and Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression affects millions worldwide, yet remains poorly diagnosed and predicted despite significant advances in mental health awareness. The World Health Organization identifies depression as a leading cause of disability globally, with many cases going undiagnosed until symptoms become severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary authors highlight how this biomarker could transform depression management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying those at risk before they experience the full impact of depression, we can intervene earlier, leading to lasting improvements in their quality of life,” noted Katerina Palacek from the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection has been proven to support remission in those with depressive symptoms and decrease the likelihood of progression to treatment resistance. This could ultimately lessen the chances of relapse, shorter periods of remission, and longer depressive episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What factors might trigger an expanded salience network in those predisposed to depression? Does this pattern appear in other mental health conditions with overlapping symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions represent important next steps for researchers in understanding the implications of this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Mechanisms Behind Network Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose three potential mechanisms underlying this salience network expansion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensatory neural changes&lt;/strong&gt;: The enlarged network could represent a compensatory response based on increased usage of this network in individuals predisposed to depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic predisposition&lt;/strong&gt;: There may be genetic factors contributing to the development of an enlarged salience network in those who later develop depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative expansion due to atrophy&lt;/strong&gt;: The salience network might appear relatively enlarged as a consequence of atrophy in other brain regions that could predate depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we observe similarities between regions implicated in depression-related brain atrophy and the salience network, including the insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, there are also notable differences,” explained Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, co-author from the University of California San Francisco’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests complex interactions between various brain networks in depression that we’re just beginning to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing Depression Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings underscore the need to reconceptualize depression as a disorder of neural connectivity rather than isolated neurotransmitter imbalances, with potential implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is not a simple disease characterized by independently functioning brain areas or isolated neurotransmitter imbalances,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109877"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/salience-network-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This characteristic brain connectivity pattern was observed consistently across individuals with depression, suggesting its potential as a depression biomarker.

man was left excessively bleeding due to a rare side effect linked to his Covid vaccine booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unidentified man who is in his 70s went to the hospital after he saw blood in his stool - believing it was due to the colonoscopy he had the day before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while examining him, doctors also noticed large, dark bruises on both of his arms that had developed within the span of a few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed he was suffering from hemophilia A, where the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11919195/Hope-thousands-haemophilia-form-new-injection.html"&gt; body prevents blood from clotting&lt;/a&gt;, causing excessive bleeding from wounds for days at end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This prolonged bleeding can cause blood to accumulate beneath the skin, forming a bruise and make the body more susceptible to injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this particular case, since the patient had sustained wounds from a colorectal procedure, they were mostly bleeding internally and the blood was only visible in their stool.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient had no family history of the condition and was not actively bleeding, according to a medical report about his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-d04903c0-3023-11f0-99e2-b1586d34f4a4" class=""&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts theorized that it was possible the shot triggered his immune system to produce antibodies against his body's clotting process and caused the disorder.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, mRNA vaccines work by prompting the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to attack &lt;span&gt;the Covid virus in the body through a piece of genetic code. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in this case doctors believe that it may be possible that the vaccine also made the body stop recognizing its own cells as safe and began developing antibodies against the clotting process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have noted that adverse reactions to Covid vaccines are extremely rare and that the benefits of getting the shot &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;outweigh potential complications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis, the experts reviewed 21 cases of AHA developing in patients after receiving Covid vaccines between 2020 to 2022 and discovered that they usually were in their 70s and symptoms tend to show 14 days after receiving the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that the condition can be fatal in about 10.3 percent of cases which is why early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AHA can cause bleeding in the skin, muscles, and soft tissues but more concerningly, it can also lead to internal bleeding, including in the brain and gastrointestinal tract - which if not controlled, can cause the body to start bleeding out and in certain cases, lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It remains unclear exactly how the vaccine triggered specific clotting antibody production in the patients' bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases OF AHA occurred after people received their first or second dose of the Covid vaccine - when the immune response is highest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this particular man developed the bleeding disorder after his fifth dose - making his case distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the elderly man initially went to the doctors, his white blood cell count, platelets count, liver and kidney function all appeared normal during tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But much to their surprise, the bruising on his arms continued to worsen and he developed large marks on his left knee two weeks later - prompting doctors to order more intensive blood tests which included a plasma test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that while his white cell and platelets counts were normal, they were certain antibodies present in his plasma that were not allowing the body's clotting process to function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed that his body's FVIII, crucial protein involved in forming blood clots to stop bleeding, levels were only at one percent in his body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, he was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A - which is known to primarily target the FVIII protein in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typical symptoms of this condition include nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood, blood in the urine and gastrointestinal bleeding. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consequently, patients also develop also complications associated with abnormal, uncontrolled bleeding into the muscles, skin and soft tissue that can occur spontaneously, during surgery or following trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it is usually treatable, AHA can potentially cause life-threatening bleeding complications in certain cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts estimate that the condition affects about two people per a million in the US - meaning that it is diagnosed in nearly 1,000 people in a population of 340 million people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for treatment, the elderly man was asked to visit a haematology clinic every week and began taking cyclophosphamide (&lt;span&gt;an immunosuppressant medication used to treat autoimmune diseases). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doctors progressively decreased his cyclophosphamide dosage as his FVIII levels improved and he showed signs of recovery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, he was also given medications to prevent fungal infections and protect the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 19:12:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORWFMUllJb3A3alhUR0I4ZzEtY3ctYmRral9yWTN2TzJBVEhqY0x2bjdIQUx1M0N2djNZOXNuQXUwLXBJMXR6eEJLOUx4bFpLX2pDSk5sVUtaNjMyamFyRkR4NHRJTWNYLWM2ZE1oZndCMC02R0pKLWUwM3ZhRTg2UVRzdW5tZEs0eERDUFUta3BuWnJOX2k4UW1KOGhuSE1rdTNzYnBkQmvSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUJTTm1RZWJUN21PY3RjSW5CVmRtZmkyMEZNeW81NDJkdnBGS2FjOWk2bS1CNnZ2RFh1Q2tDSW51WDItb3FucGxTV3poVW1zVzU2d0hGVXFxdkQtYlkzODV1RnZPVHBCVEJOaUxVU2hvdC02SWthN2xpaEdyZTZHRUJ5b19BbmZlTDVqaklSVmJIcEhtYUN2Nk1fQ0I2RWFvZVJKWVRSTk01eU82N0hn</guid></item><item><title>坐得太多？即使你经常锻炼，你的大脑也可能会萎缩-研究发现 | Sitting Too Much?

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older adults who sat longer each day showed faster brain shrinkage, even if they exercised regularly.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sitting time was linked to worse memory and cognitive performance, especially in people with the APOE-ε4 gene.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spending less time sitting may protect your brain as much as adding more exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASHVILLE —&lt;/strong&gt; Are you reading this while lounging on your couch? You might want to stand up. New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study spanning seven years found that older adults who spent more hours sitting experienced faster brain shrinkage and mental decline – even among those who regularly worked out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding challenges what many people believe: that regular exercise makes up for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hours of sitting&lt;/a&gt;. According to the research, most participants were active enough to meet CDC guidelines for weekly physical activity. Yet their sedentary behavior still harmed their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-cost-of-being-sedentary"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Being Sedentary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Vanderbilt University’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center followed 404 older adults (average age 71) for seven years, using wrist-worn activity monitors to accurately track movement patterns. On average, participants sat for about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/millennials-sitting-biological-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;13 hours daily&lt;/a&gt; – a number that might seem high until you add up your own sitting time from commuting, desk work, meals, and evening relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain changes linked to more sitting occurred in regions that are typically vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. People who sat more showed thinning in these areas and performed worse on memory tests that asked them to recall past experiences and events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, those who sat more lost hippocampal volume faster and showed greater declines in their ability to name objects and process information quickly. The hippocampus, which helps form memories, is among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-risk-factors-amplify-the-problem"&gt;Genetic Risk Factors Amplify the Problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most concerning was that sitting had worse effects on carriers of the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/alzheimers-shaping-brain-20s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APOE-ε4 gene variant&lt;/a&gt;, which increases Alzheimer’s risk. When researchers separated participants by genetic status, they discovered that APOE-ε4 carriers who sat more showed significantly greater reductions in total brain matter, frontal lobe volume, and parietal lobe volume compared to non-carriers with similar sitting habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that “APOE-ε4 carriers appear to be at increased risk for neurodegeneration associated with greater &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sedentary-study-obesity/"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt;, independent of physical activity level.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have connected too much sitting with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, and cancer, this research strengthens the evidence that brain health belongs on that list. Researchers believe that prolonged sitting may harm blood vessels in the brain, increase &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-worked"&gt;How the Study Worked&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team used advanced equipment that measured movement 30 times per second. This allowed them to distinguish between sitting still, light activity like casual walking, and more vigorous movement far more accurately than asking people to recall their activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed extensive cognitive testing and underwent detailed brain scans at the beginning of the study and during follow-up visits. Researchers analyzed various brain regions and something they called an “AD-neuroimaging signature” – a measurement of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brain-thinning-dementia-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain thickness&lt;/a&gt; in areas typically affected by Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this study particularly valuable is that it controlled for physical activity, allowing researchers to isolate the specific effects of sitting. This reveals that even if you follow exercise guidelines religiously, spending most of your remaining hours sitting could still &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/doing-chores-bigger-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;harm your brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-your-brain-health"&gt;Protecting Your Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With smartphones and artificial intelligence making it easier and easier for people to do countless tasks without getting up, it’s no surprise Americans are becoming increasingly sedentary. The average &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;older adult&lt;/a&gt; spends over 9 hours sitting daily, according to previous research mentioned in the study. And that was before the pandemic pushed many people toward even less active lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For anyone worried about brain health, the message is clear: cutting sitting time matters just as much as increasing exercise. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/standing-desks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Standing desks&lt;/a&gt;, movement breaks throughout the day, and finding ways to add more motion to daily routines could help protect against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to an important conclusion: what you do between workouts matters just as much as the workouts themselves. Your &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; depends not just on making time for exercise, but on minimizing time spent sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project studied 404 older adults (71 ± 9 years old) without dementia at baseline. Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT9X Link) on their non-dominant wrist continuously for 7 days to measure sedentary behavior and physical activity levels. They also underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and 3T brain MRI scans at baseline and follow-up visits over a 7-year period (average follow-up time was 4.7 years). The researchers used linear regressions for cross-sectional analyses and linear mixed-effects regression models for longitudinal analyses, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, APOE-ε4 status, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, cognitive status, and intracranial volume (for MRI outcomes). Models were repeated with adjustment for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to assess the independent contribution of sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greater sedentary time was cross-sectionally associated with a smaller Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging signature (a composite measure of cortical thickness in regions affected by AD) and worse episodic memory performance. Longitudinally, greater sedentary time was associated with faster hippocampal volume reductions and faster declines in naming and processing speed. Many of the observed associations (particularly cross-sectional ones) were stronger in APOE-ε4 carriers, suggesting that genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease may amplify the negative effects of sedentary behavior. Importantly, most participants (87%) met CDC physical activity guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity weekly, suggesting that high physical activity levels do not completely counteract the negative effects of sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sample lacked racial and ethnic diversity (85% non-Hispanic White) and was highly educated (average 16 years of education), limiting generalizability. The sample was also quite physically active, with 87% meeting CDC physical activity recommendations, which may limit generalizability to less active populations. The researchers used cross-sectional MRI registration at each time point versus longitudinal registration. The study did not examine the pattern of sedentary behavior (e.g., prolonged sitting versus frequent breaks) or consider a compositional analysis of the 24-hour activity period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by multiple grants, including T32-AG058524, Alzheimer’s Association IIRG-08-88733, R01-AG034962, K24-AG046373, K01-AG083223, Vanderbilt Clinical Translational Science Awards, Vanderbilt’s High-Performance Computer Cluster for Biomedical Research, and the Richard Eugene Hickman Alzheimer’s Disease Research Endowment.

&lt;p&gt;In a world-first clinical trial, Japanese scientists have successfully implanted lab-grown brain cells into Parkinson’s disease patients — and early results suggest the treatment may actually work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the results hold, the implications could be enormous — not just for Parkinson’s, but for other neurodegenerative diseases too. Huntington’s, ALS, even Alzheimer’s could be future targets for similar cell-replacement strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

Image from the study.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It begins subtly, often with tremors in one hand or a slight stiffness in the limbs. But over time, it chips away at a person’s ability to walk, speak, and live independently. It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://parkinsonseurope.org/facts-and-figures/statistics/"&gt;10 million people&lt;/a&gt; live with Parkinson’s, and is prevalence is rising fast as populations age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit is the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/parkinsons-disease/causes/"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Without enough &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/dopamine-movement-neurons/"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, the brain’s signals to the muscles falter. There’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, just treatments to slow down progression and deal with some of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had the idea to replace dead cells directly in the brain for decades. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536728/"&gt;In the 1980s&lt;/a&gt; and ’90s, some researchers tried &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3250289/"&gt;transplanting fetal brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; into patients, but the results were inconsistent. Some patients improved, others didn’t. Tumors and uncontrolled movements were common side effects. And the ethical concerns surrounding fetal tissue never went away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study from Japan takes a new approach to this idea. Instead of fetal tissue, researchers used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) — adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells. These versatile cells can be turned into nearly any cell type in the body. And that includes the dopamine-producing neurons that Parkinson’s destroys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-promising-though-not-perfect"&gt;Promising, though not perfect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were enrolled in the study. One dropped out before surgery due to a COVID-19 infection, and another received the transplant in two stages and was evaluated only for safety (not for drug efficacy). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of the patients had any major side effects and four showed improvements in movement when off their usual medications. Their average motor scores improved by 20%, and brain scans confirmed that the implanted cells were producing dopamine. A fifth patient improved while on medication. One patient didn’t improve, but their symptoms didn’t worsen either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gains were modest but meaningful. One patient improved by two stages on &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379751/"&gt;the Hoehn–Yahr scale&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used measure of Parkinson’s severity. Another saw a 50% improvement in motor function during off-medication testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a significant achievement that we have been able to confirm improvement in patients’ symptoms,” &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08700-0"&gt;said Jun Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;, director of Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, who is leading the research. “We hope to deliver this treatment to patients as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dopamine-is-back-to-an-extent"&gt;Dopamine is back, to an extent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers carried out brain scans to see how much dopamine production increased. They used a specialized tracer and found that in the patients that received the highest dose, dopamine increased by an average of 63.5%; in the low-dose group, it rose by just 7%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, in three patients, dopamine activity increased only in specific parts of the brain — right where the cells were injected. That local boost was still enough to improve symptoms in some cases, but there was no generalized return of dopamine production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study authors are confident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This trial is the most advanced test yet of iPS-cell-derived neurons in human patients — and the results may open the door to regulatory approval. Sumitomo Pharma, the company which helped manufacture the cells, plans to seek approval to manufacture and sell the treatment in Japan by the end of fiscal 2025. If successful, it would become only the second approved iPS-cell-based regenerative medicine product in the country, after a treatment for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s goal is to develop a standardized, off-the-shelf cell therapy that can be administered to a wide population. The cells used in this study were derived from a donor whose genetic immune profile matches about 17% of the Japanese population, reducing the risk of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japan has made regenerative medicine &lt;a href="https://www.jetro.go.jp/usa/topics/japan-laws-regenerative-medicine-market.html"&gt;a priority&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first country to approve clinical use of iPS cells, and it continues to lead in funding and infrastructure for stem cell-based treatments. This trial may put Japan at the forefront of a new era in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08700-0"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you hit the gym after work, head to the local park to chill with friends, or—if you're like me—unwind with a luxurious bubble bath. For many of us, kicking back often includes a drink or two. After all, consuming alcohol is commonly associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6760384/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress relief;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stress relief&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of something with dinner. But when it comes to whether you grab an &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64431721/is-it-ok-to-drink-beer-every-day-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ice-cold beer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ice-cold beer&lt;/a&gt; from the fridge or opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glass of wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;glass of wine&lt;/a&gt; to cap off your week, there are a few things worth considering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both beer and wine have their own benefits and downfalls. "Neither is inherently better, but the context of consumption matters greatly," says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits Of Wine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two beverages, experts often highlight red wine for its health benefits. Registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-abrownstein.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Brownstein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Brownstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, notes that red wine in particular is loaded with polyphenols—antioxidants that may help protect the heart, lower &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"bad" LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"bad" LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce inflammation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770725000636" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that moderate red wine consumption can decrease LDL cholesterol, which is linked to a lower risk of artery-clogging and heart disease. "Polyphenols in red wine help lower cholesterol by limiting how much the liver absorbs and preventing the breakdown of LDL cholesterol," Brownstein explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/entertaining/wine/g29023291/red-wine-types/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:red wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;red wine&lt;/a&gt; "has been lauded for its antioxidants like resveratrol, which may support heart health," says Manaker. Resveratrol has been known to prevent plaque buildup on artery walls and has both anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63015074/walnuts-anti-aging-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However," cautions Brownstein, "despite promising research on resveratrol's health benefits, additional studies are needed to shape clinical guidance and recommendations. Moreover, it remains unclear if the resveratrol's benefits outweigh alcohol's negative health effects." In fact, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4942868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even concluded that it's not actually possible to absorb the recommended therapeutic dose of resveratrol solely by drinking wine, anyway. What a buzz kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, Manaker tells us that some of the health benefits associated with red wine can also be found in grape juice, particularly when it comes to heart health. Shucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some experts claim that red wine has a slight edge in health benefits when compared to white varietals, the differences are pretty negligible. White wine has fewer &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64210343/superfoods-to-help-you-live-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and polyphenols, but still enough that it can help aid in digestion and support the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits Of Beer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For beer drinkers, you'll be happy to discover that a number of brews contain certain B vitamins. "Some types of beer," explains Manaker, "especially craft and darker varieties, also contain antioxidants, though typically in smaller amounts than red wine." Add to that recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001413/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown moderate beer consumption is linked to a decrease in cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, not to mention its link to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/sns-dailymeal-1870435-healthy-eating-beer-unexpected-health-benefits-study-020818-20180208-story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other metabolic health benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other metabolic health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and that beer after work suddenly isn't looking too bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Downfalls Of Beer &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both beer and wine have their own purported health benefits, like anything, they should only be consumed in moderation. "Alcohol of any kind can negatively impact liver health, disrupt sleep, and increase your risk of chronic conditions and addiction when consumed in excess," says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also points out another health consideration: "These beverages come with calories, which can add up quickly, especially with beer, which is often consumed in larger quantities." Generally, beer contains more calories &lt;em&gt;per s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;erving&lt;/em&gt; than wine, mainly due to its larger serving size and higher carbohydrate content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a standard 175 ml (about 6 oz) glass of 12% ABV wine has around 133 calories, while a pint (16 oz) of 5% ABV beer contains about 239 calories—making "a beer" roughly 50% higher in calories per typical serving than "a glass" of wine. (A serving of red wine is smaller than a serving of beer because it typically has a higher alcohol content, so it’s important to keep portion sizes in mind.) If you’re watching your calorie intake, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/g36742827/best-light-beer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:light beers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;light beers&lt;/a&gt; are a lower-calorie option, often containing &lt;a href="https://www.cspinet.org/article/which-alcoholic-beverages-have-most-or-least-calories" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fewer calories than both regular beer and wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fewer calories than both regular beer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, both beer and wine are alcohol, which comes with serious health concerns. "While sharing a glass of red wine with friends during a wholesome meal that includes fish, vegetables, and whole grains can absolutely be part of a healthy lifestyle for most, polishing off an entire bottle alone on the couch while binge-watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64717140/love-island-serena-page-unfollowed-costars-suck-it-up/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Love Island;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Love Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reruns is a different story," Manaker colorfully notes. "Ultimately, the healthiest choice is to drink mindfully, within your personal limits, and as part of an overall balanced diet. Moderation and context are the keys!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, "moderate" drinking is considered two drinks or less per day for men and one drink or less per day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when it comes down to it, which drink is actually better for your health? Manaker says it depends not only on your personal preferences, but also on your overall lifestyle. "Both have potential health benefits in moderation, but it’s important first emphasize the key word: moderation," she says. Brownstein has a more definitive answer: "Red wine would be considered healthier than beer due to its polyphenol content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownstein shares that one &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1519" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that those who moderately drink beer reported better self-perceived health, including better mental and physical health and social support, compared to people who did not drink, as well as former drinkers and those who consume high amounts of alcohol. However, she recommends weighing your decision whether or not to drink along with your healthcare provider and lifestyle, medical history, and health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly for those of us who love an end-of-day drink, the health benefits of wine and beer are modest at best, and don't seem to outweigh the cancer risks and other associated negatives of drinking. When it comes to beer vs. wine, there's not a hard and fast "better" option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, enjoying either wine or beer is all about finding what works for you and pairing it with a healthy lifestyle," states Manaker. "Both can bring enjoyment, whether during a meal or a social gathering, as long as they’re consumed thoughtfully."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 18:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBzeE0zYnVsR2xzNVRjcjRsbndJWFZJQlRfMXM3ZU1iaVdER0RFNUJ1S183Tk9jZmc2RGdfMnRjdnM0V1hZTHhDSERicExOei1YeEgyN3VhczlTVGxpaVg2bkZtcmNjOHR6T05nRDExTmRkSWZa</guid></item><item><title>根据研究，您需要提升体重才能看到肌肉增长的确切时间-财富 | The exact amount of time you need to lift weights to see muscle gains, according to research - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQNWswNjBNYzlPYkNqWXhybDdqbS16WHl3dkZqb2EtRldiaWpSZzJUc04zWTg1cC1TNGZFRjg3TnRQQzc4ZGhYYnVRdnhZWDFhbjk4U3FwbDFZU0x2bTdhQWFQcTM2d0hCblNqaGhqcGxoUVFrRW03U3Q2UHJaU2Q4Vlhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQNWswNjBNYzlPYkNqWXhybDdqbS16WHl3dkZqb2EtRldiaWpSZzJUc04zWTg1cC1TNGZFRjg3TnRQQzc4ZGhYYnVRdnhZWDFhbjk4U3FwbDFZU0x2bTdhQWFQcTM2d0hCblNqaGhqcGxoUVFrRW03U3Q2UHJaU2Q4Vlhn</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州麻疹爆发达到D-FW ，在科林县和罗克沃尔县有相关病例-达拉斯新闻 | Texas measles outbreak reaches D-FW, with linked cases in Collin and Rockwall counties - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNYUtnMk9aQ3hhNDQxUGluVXNhbXBKbTVhc2psNzlGSUdqbzU2YXh1Vm9ZUnRYci1nS1RFd1AyWV9MeFlVVm1OVlNuZFA1R2FiT0Z1UE90QkJ4dkFSYXA2NGF2YjB3T1dtcGxVR2tyb0VuXzdlUEFVbnRxbG40ZTVkandvcVBQVzFvaWVjbWRTUktuQTRZZWZfUTZjOUpBSUFVQ05sQ2tGalJNR2YtY3c5MTZLSHU1eTV0WHpwQ0lQN2tmSGREWlZ4V0piZElxTlpGXzU5aGtYWWtEb2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="body-text dmnc_features-article-body-body-module__Ldbl- mb-8 false"&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The measles outbreak that began in Gaines County has officially reached the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with two cases now linked to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;One measles case in Collin County and one case in Rockwall County are now included in the outbreak numbers, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;a Tuesday update&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;State officials have publicly reported seven measles cases in Dallas-Fort Worth this year.

Two children in Texas have died. Both children were unvaccinated and did not have underlying health conditions, according to Texas officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people. The two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Due to widespread vaccine uptake, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Since then, there have still been outbreaks in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone, beginning at about 12 months of age.

But many of them have a major downside: They’re ultra-processed. They’re frequently laden with salt, saturated fat, added sugars and industrial additives like artificial flavors, synthetic preservatives and emulsifiers. &lt;a href="https://cappellos.com/collections/pizza/products/uncured-pepperoni-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;Some popular frozen cheese pizza brands&lt;/a&gt; have nearly an entire day’s worth of saturated fat and 60 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SIFR3SHRNAF7O3SVP4ZSEFVPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/27/ultra-processed-foods-predigested-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that eating a lot of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic diseases. Health experts say it’s a good idea to limit your intake — but that you don’t have to avoid them at all costs. For one, it’s impractical: Ultra-processed foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01095-7" target="_blank"&gt;about 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all food items sold in grocery stores. And second, you can include some processed foods in your diet and still be healthy. That’s because they’re not all created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEVDYPIPVBGCJKK7QKBQL5VYTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We analyzed dozens of frozen pizza brands and discovered that some use mostly simple ingredients like wheat flour, tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic powder and mozzarella cheese, while others contain so many preservatives, flavor enhancers, emulsifiers and artificial ingredients that their ingredients lists can sound like a high school chemistry experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTXWDGJX5FHBTCQUH4P2ODSU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how to make frozen pizza a more nutritious meal, red flags to watch out for — and six of the healthiest pizzas we found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to make frozen pizzas healthier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUNGQPEBSNH3NP6A6EAZ2SWG44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You probably&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;shouldn’t eat frozen pizza every day, nutrition experts say, but it can still be part of a healthy, occasional lunch or dinner. The key is to purchase a quality brand and to make it part of a balanced meal, said Federica Amati, a medical scientist at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at Zoe, a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;personalized nutrition company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FKI4MZ37RJEV7NVDWJ3R7PKEYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could steam some broccoli or chop up carrots and cucumbers to eat with your pizza. Maybe make a hard-boiled egg to go along with it. And have some fresh fruit, walnuts or mixed nuts at the end of your meal, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24C5RPM4D5C73EF3KJSRJYG7PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want pizza with toppings, choose ones that have veggies such as onion, peppers, mushrooms and spinach. Or better yet, buy a Margherita pizza and add your own veggies at home. If you have kids, put some sliced veggies, corn and olives on the counter and let them choose their own toppings. Kids are more likely to eat veggies if you give them choices and involve them in the cooking process, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WLUI54CWI5A4VPGUUNEOB7GAVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want meat toppings, you should add your own — ideally things like grilled chicken or tuna. If you want sausage or pepperoni, buy them separately and look for the “uncured” versions that advertise low sodium and no added nitrates or nitrites. These two preservatives have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303088/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Look for these red flags on the label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="P3EZN46IYFG5FH7C2OUMB37ERE" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High sodium:&lt;/b&gt; Many brands of frozen cheese pizza contain high levels of sodium. It’s not uncommon to see brands that add salt to the crust, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings. We found that sodium levels in most brands of frozen pizza ranged from about 20 to 60 percent of the recommended daily limit for sodium intake per serving. Consuming a lot of sodium can increase your &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;risk of developing hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. It’s best to look for brands that are relatively low in sodium — the less sodium the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added sugars: &lt;/b&gt;Some brands add sugar into their pizza sauces and crusts. We found brands that had nearly a teaspoon of added sugar per serving or more. While it’s normal for pizza to contain some sugar — tomatoes naturally contain some sugar — you don’t need a lot of extra&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sugar in your pizza. Look for brands that contain no more than one or two grams of added sugar per serving — or, ideally, no added sugar at all. Added sugars may be listed on food labels under names like dextrose, corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup, malt barley extract, sucrose and cane sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processed meats:&lt;/b&gt; Processed meats like pepperoni, sausage and bacon contain a lot of sodium, saturated fat and preservatives. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that they increase your risk of developing multiple cancers, colorectal cancer in particular. For that reason, you should avoid buying frozen pizzas that have processed meats on them, Amati said. Processed meats are generally considered those that are smoked, cured, salted or that have had preservatives added to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrial additives:&lt;/b&gt; Many frozen pizza brands use additives that have been linked to health problems. These include things like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) — two synthetic preservatives that have been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590883/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer in animal studies&lt;/a&gt;. Other additives to look out for are emulsifiers like &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank"&gt;polysorbate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8539934/" target="_blank"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004338" target="_blank"&gt;mono- and diglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as industrial preservatives such as propylparaben and sodium nitrite. Pick frozen pizzas that contain mostly simple ingredients that you recognize and would use at home in your own kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Try these healthier frozen pizza brands&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="5KBIKC4WG5BMBGHIOWUEUFY2XQ" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/cheese-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s Cheese Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This frozen pizza has one of the simplest ingredients lists we could find. The primary ingredients are organic wheat flour, mozzarella cheese, organic tomato puree, organic extra virgin olive oil, and a variety of everyday spices and seasonings. The pizza is also relatively low in sodium, sugar and saturated fat compared to other brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://newmansown.com/product/harvest-vegetable-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newman’s Own Thin &amp;amp; Crispy Crust Harvest Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This is a good example of a frozen pizza that has recognizable ingredients that you’d expect to find in a home-cooked pizza, Amati said. It is relatively low in salt, sugar and saturated fat compared to other pizzas, and its ingredients list has no surprises. It contains simple things like wheat flour, whole oat flour, vegetable oil, olive oil, tomato puree, mozzarella cheese, red wine vinegar, garlic and other spices. Even better, it has a variety of nutritious toppings, including several vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatbanza.com/products/roasted-veggie" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Banza Roasted Veggie Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This frozen pizza stands out because its crust is made from chickpeas. That means this pizza is gluten-free, and it also has significantly more fiber and protein than most other brands. One serving contains 10 grams of fiber. It also has 16 grams of protein — nearly equivalent to the amount of protein in three eggs. This pizza does have some additives, like tapioca starch and sunflower lecithin, but they are not considered harmful, Amati said. “Overall, this pizza has a nice combination of ingredients,” she added. “It’s a little more processed than the others, but it doesn’t have any ingredients that are high risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodnes.com/cpk-frozen/products/crispy-thin-crust-margherita-frozen-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;California Pizza Kitchen Margherita Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; One serving of this frozen pizza has 20 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving, which is lower than most other brands we analyzed. It also has fairly high-quality ingredients, Amati said. It’s made from things like enriched wheat flour (flour that’s been fortified with iron and B vitamins), tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, extra virgin olive oil, herbs, spices and baking powder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/whole-foods-market-mushroom-with-truffle-sauce-pizza-134-oz-b0cns3v1cm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole Foods Market Mushroom with Truffle Sauce Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The ingredients list for this white pizza is notably free of many of the synthetic or potentially problematic additives commonly found in frozen pizzas. The crust contains just five ingredients: wheat flour, water, extra virgin olive oil, salt and yeast. The toppings include recognizable ingredients like lemon juice, sunflower oil, portobello and cremini mushrooms, and mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. It has no added sugar, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it’s relatively low in sodium and saturated fat compared to most other frozen cheese pizzas we looked at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/roasted-vegetable-pizza-vegan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s No Cheese Roasted Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Finding a good-quality vegan or dairy-free frozen pizza is no easy task. That’s because many of them contain ultra-processed cheese alternatives that are made from coconut oil, xanthan gum and various emulsifiers and thickening agents. It’s better to buy a plain wheat crust and add your own tomato or pesto sauce and veggie toppings, Amati said. “As an Italian, I can tell you that pizza does not have to have cheese on it,” she added. Another option is to buy a “no cheese” frozen pizza like this one from Amy’s and add your own vegan cheese, preferably one that’s made from nuts instead of coconut oil and that doesn’t have a lot of additives, Amati said. One example of a vegan cheese with relatively good ingredients is Kite Hill’s dairy-free “&lt;a href="https://kite-hill.com/collections/ricotta-alternative/products/almond-milk-ricotta-alternative" target="_blank"&gt;Almond Milk Ricotta Alternative&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s made from just a handful of ingredients: almond milk (water, almonds) salt, enzymes cultures, and tartaric acid, a preservative that occurs naturally in grapes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

The consistency stems from the fixed position of blood vessels under the skin, which constrict after prolonged immersion, creating the familiar loops and ridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tested the same fingers across multiple immersions and found near-identical wrinkle topography each time. The findings could have forensic applications, including identification of bodies exposed to water and new approaches in biometric science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeatable Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Wrinkle topography stays consistent across water exposures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vessel-Based Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood vessel constriction—not skin swelling—drives wrinkle formation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forensic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could aid in identification after water-related deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Binghamton University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your wrinkles always form in the same pattern every time you’re in the water for too long? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, Binghamton University Associate Professor Guy German published research about why human skin wrinkles when you stay in the water too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109871"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-300x207.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-770x532.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-293x202.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-150x104.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows wrinkled fingers." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-300x207.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-770x532.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-293x202.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-150x104.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;New research from Binghamton University, State University of New York reveals that wrinkle patterns on skin actually stay the same over time. Credit: Brenderous&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Received wisdom held that the water swelled your skin and made your fingers wrinkly, but little to no research had been done to prove that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What German and his team at the Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory found is that blood vessels beneath the skin actually contract after prolonged immersion, and that’s where the wrinkles come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote about the research for The Conversation — a nonprofit news organization that asks academics to share their expertise on current topics — as part of its Curious Kids feature. One of the follow-up questions stumped him, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A student asked, ‘Yeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?’ And I thought: I haven’t the foggiest clue!” said German, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Department of Biomedical Engineering. “So it led to this research to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials&lt;/em&gt;, German and Rachel Laytin ’23, MS ’24, show that, yes, the topography patterns remain constant after multiple immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood vessels don’t change their position much — they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they’re pretty static,” German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research put subjects’ fingers in water for 30 minutes, taking photos and then repeating the immersion under the same conditions at least 24 hours later. By comparing the images, German and Laytin found the same patterns of raised loops and ridges after both immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also made an interesting side discovery: “We’ve heard that wrinkles don’t form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers,” German said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of my students told us, ‘I’ve got median nerve damage in my fingers.’ So we tested him — no wrinkles!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much fun as it was to figure out something a child asked, the research also could have real-world applications in forensics, such as fingerprinting at crime scenes and identifying bodies found after prolonged water exposure. German’s father, a retired U.K. police officer, faced some of these challenges during his law enforcement career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,” he said. “I always think about this sort of stuff, because it’s fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German is eager to further explore questions about skin immersion with his students: “I feel like a kid in a candy store, because there’s so much science here that I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thank the people at The Conversation and the wonderful question they asked us, because does it create cool new science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this forensic neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#472d25352f222b07252e29202f262a33282969222332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John Brhel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://binghamton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Binghamton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;John Brhel – Binghamton University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Brenderous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2025.106935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin&lt;/a&gt;” by Guy German et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finger wrinkling during and after water immersion, often called pruning, is an evolutionary mechanism that increases grip strength in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have determined that water-induced finger wrinkles result from vasoconstriction, or the tightening of blood vessels below the skin’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, no previous studies have characterized the morphology of topographical finger wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We anticipate that vasoconstriction also governs the morphology of finger wrinkles formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since these constricting blood vessels are stationary, we expect the pattern created by topographical wrinkles formed to remain constant over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate pattern repeatability, images of human fingertips at two separate time points are overlaid and compared visually to establish corresponding wrinkle pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrinkle pairs are vectorized with orientation correlations evaluated quantitatively using normalized dot products, then compared against randomly oriented control vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate a significant relationship between wrinkle orientation across both time points and thus reveal the consistency of wrinkle morphology over time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 16:24:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1wVU90MDAxRGZVMkZtbUxILXRnZXpMblI2bzlDeWVXNWVvbmUycG42Q2I3YUYzOG9OTDhSNk9NeFczRGVLTHV0MXR0NkdTZW9jU1dBUnB5Nk9hTlpXS2lIMV93ekZXQ25UVS1CbHlBWWwtMXpScE93dEhDeUI</guid></item><item><title>新命名的古蝉化石保存完好，您可以看到其翅膀上的血管- CNN | Newly named ancient cicada fossil is so well preserved you can see the veins in its wings - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5XRk8wbTN3b1hsZmUtYVVkRE5yemVxaTM2R0tNSXJrRWNDXzdpdWw3RzAwVjJ5UTFRUWM4RDNiXzktemY3NlplZFZYWk1EZ1dIRmJYNUlyTVp5Ui00cHF3elRlM3JkdzZoQXFJR2FFa0NNbDRpcGFpTVJUbzRfQUnSAYQBQVVfeXFMTkdielVIYjlaVjIxS21QX0djN2Y1NVpKYXZieEN1NnZucVl5Yk9faVZsdVVEOWsxY3ZOR1I0VWZsRzJ4SUY1YkNidGctUHNSaVVrZnNhbDctWHFVS3I0TmMyZEtpbHhObUI1a0lqclNlYXJzRjk5VTYtNmswUjEzOWFfVDhp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Pressed into a piece of rock is the flattened, 47 million-year-old body of a cicada. Measuring about 1 inch (26.5 millimeters) long with a wingspan of 2.7 inches (68.2 millimeters), its fossilized form is nearly intact, with its veined wings spread wide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000e356mx1r221ao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists recently described the insect as a new genus and species, using this fossil and one other that was nearly as well preserved, from the same site. Even though the specimens are female, their location on the cicada family tree suggests that males of this species could sing as modern cicadas do. Found in Germany decades ago, their presence there reveals that singing cicadas dispersed in Europe millions of years earlier than once thought.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000f356msroelr50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fossils are also the oldest examples of “true” singing cicadas in the family Cicadidae, researchers reported April 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94099-7" target="_blank"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;. Most modern cicadas belong to this family, including annual cicadas that appear every summer worldwide, as well as broods of black-bodied and red-eyed periodical cicadas, which emerge from May to June in eastern North America in cycles of 13 or 17 years. Brood XIV, one of the biggest broods, emerges across a dozen US states this year. Cicadas are found on every continent except Antarctica, and there are more than 3,000 species.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000g356m8j3cc9vz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fossil record for insects in general is abundant in just a &lt;a href="https://entomologytoday.org/2021/02/03/what-fossil-record-tells-about-insect-extinctions-deep-time/" target="_blank"&gt;few dozen locations&lt;/a&gt;, and while modern cicada species are numerous today, paleontologists have documented only &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94099-7" target="_blank"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; Cicadidae fossils. The earliest definitive fossil of a singing cicada was discovered in Montana and dates from 59 million to 56 million years ago, said lead study author Dr. Hui Jiang, a paleontologist and researcher with the Bonn Institute of Organismic Biology at the University of Bonn in Germany. Its newly described relative is the earliest singing cicada from Europe, Jiang told CNN in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000h356m3ykbosth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the body structures of the European fossils were so well      preserved, scientists were able to assign      the ancient insect to a modern tribe of cicadas called Platypleurini, “which is today primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, but is absent from Europe,” Jiang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000i356m9idxgok4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prior research suggested that this lineage evolved in Africa about 30 million to 25 million years ago and dispersed from there, according to Jiang. “This fossil pushes back the known fossil record of sound-producing cicadas in the tribe Platypleurini by approximately 20 million years, indicating that the diversification of this group occurred much earlier than previously recognized,” the researcher added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000j356mv1bbn3ss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The discovery hints that this group of cicadas evolved more slowly than prior estimates from molecular data proposed, said &lt;a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/staff/conrad-labandeira" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Conrad Labandeira&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research geologist and curator of fossil arthropods at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

            “This suggests that older fossils of the Platypleurini are yet to be discovered,” said Labandeira, who was not involved in the research. “Such discoveries would assist in providing better calibrations for determining a more realistic evolutionary rate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers named the cicada Eoplatypleura messelensis. Its name refers to where the specimens were discovered: the Messel Pit in Germany, a rich fossil site dating to the Eocene epoch (57 million to 36 million years ago). Excavated in the 1980s, the fossils have since been in the collection of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt in Germany, said senior study author &lt;a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/senckenberg-research-institute-natural-history-museum-frankfurt/division-messel-research-mammalogy/section-palaeoentomology/palaeoentomology-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sonja Wedmann&lt;/a&gt;, head of Senckenberg’s paleoentomology department.

            A very deep volcanic lake, with a bottom where no oxygen penetrated, once filled the Messel Pit. That environment created ideal conditions for fossilization, and fine-grain sediments from this former lake bed hold a variety of Eocene life, Wedmann told CNN in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000n356m23tvqsen@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The excellent preservation not only of insects, but of all groups of organisms, is the reason why Messel is an UNESCO world heritage site,” a designation it earned in 1995, Wedmann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000o356mn8sbsyst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The more      complete of the two cicada fossils “is one of the best preserved insects from the Messel pit fossil site,” Wedmann added. “Senckenberg has a collection of over 20,000 fossil insects from Messel, and among these it stands out because of its really beautiful and complete preservation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000p356m6mlomp79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its overall head and body shape, E. messelensis strongly resembles modern cicadas. Its rostrum — a snoutlike mouth — is intact, but closer analysis is needed to tell whether it used the rostrum for feeding on plant tissues called xylem, as most modern cicadas do, Labandeira said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000q356m92qrq5ur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            E. messelensis also shows hints of colors and patterns in its wings. This feature camouflages modern cicadas as they cling to tree trunks, and it may have served a similar purpose for E. messelensis, according to Jiang.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000r356m9dzkiblw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, E. messelensis differs from modern cicadas in subtle ways. For example, its forewings are broader and less elongated than those of species alive today, which may have affected how it flew.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s8000s356m480piurq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Would the ancient cicada’s call have sounded like those of its modern relatives? “We can’t know the exact song,” Jiang said. However, based on the cicada’s body shape and placement in the singing cicada group, “it likely produced sounds similar in function to modern cicadas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s9000t356m4ubk8vsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Brood XIV emerges in the billions in the late spring and early summer of 2025, their calls will measure from &lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2021/07/20/noise-myths-cicada/" target="_blank"&gt;90 to 100 decibels&lt;/a&gt; — as loud &lt;a href="https://www.hearingconservation.org/assets/Decibel.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;as a subway train&lt;/a&gt;. Other types of cicadas produce an even bigger ruckus: Songs of the African cicada Brevisana brevis peak at nearly &lt;a href="https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_24.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;107 decibels&lt;/a&gt;, about as loud as a jet taking off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s9000v356m8nsdr00o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The volume of the ancient species’ songs may have been even louder than that, Jiang said. The abdomen of E. messelensis is broader and larger than those of its modern relatives, suggesting that males could have had a larger resonating cavity. This cavity may have amplified sound from the vibrating structures in their abdomens, called tymbals, to produce a louder buzz.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmamkw3s9000w356mzhzdxolu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, this is only a hypothesis,” Jiang added. “Future studies on how morphology relates to sound production in modern cicadas will help to test it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

– are usually triggered by tree pollen in the spring, grass pollen in the summer and weed pollen in the fall. About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and 10-15% of children in &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/about-allergy/statistics-and-figures/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a413c485-dd8e-4303-8eb6-86c93c16f978" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Pollen is everywhere.

It usually takes two years to develop sensitivities to particular allergens, says Dr Payel Gupta, a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and the medical director for allergy and immunology at Tono Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-treat-seasonal-allergies" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you treat seasonal allergies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of over-the-counter medications can help manage allergy symptoms, says Bhasin. These include decongestants, antihistamine pills, nasal sprays and eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In order for these medications to work, says Bhasin, you have to be proactive and start your regimen at least two weeks before pollen season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"36b65e13-fcd2-4e11-908e-c6cee39d269e","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="36b65e13-fcd2-4e11-908e-c6cee39d269e" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bhasin notes that antihistamines can lose efficacy over time. If a medication “is not consistently controlling symptoms”, you “may have developed tolerance” to it, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, nasal sprays need to be used regularly to be of any help. Bhasin says she often sees patients discontinue using nasal sprays after three to five days because they don’t seem to be working, but it takes 10-14 days of consistent use for these sprays to reach maximum efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts caution that when overused, decongestants can cause a rebound effect, where nasal congestion &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23393-rhinitis-medicamentosa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worsens&lt;/a&gt;. “Do not use them for more than three days,” says Carver, and check with your doctor before using if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma or trouble urinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At home, keep windows closed and the air conditioning running so that clean air can circulate. Make sure to regularly change air filters as well. When pollen counts are especially high, Carver suggests wearing a mask outside. And always remove your shoes, shower and change into a fresh set of clothes when you get home, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0ed6968a-29f2-44c8-9751-8936e272abfd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Hay fever making your life a misery?

In contrast, those with restricted networks, often limited to family and shaped by isolation, reported significantly worse health and were less likely to improve their social ties over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused networks offered emotional closeness but lacked the health benefits of broader connection. Encouragingly, some individuals transitioned into more enriched networks, suggesting social mobility is possible with the right support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Disparities:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults in restricted networks had the poorest health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Mobility:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 40% of individuals in focused networks moved into enriched ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Barriers:&lt;/strong&gt; Women, people of color, and the oldest adults were most at risk of social network decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study sheds light on the powerful connection between social networks and health in later life and reveals a surprising path for improving health equity among older adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Innovation in Aging,&lt;/em&gt; the study tracked over 1,500 older adults for a decade using three rounds of data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109866"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people and network lines." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-health-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By contrast, over 85% of those who began in the restricted group remained there, highlighting the stability — and vulnerability — of this network type, the researchers found. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Lissette Piedra, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and James Iveniuk, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center; the team identified three types of social networks &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;enriched, focused and restricted &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;that reflected how socially connected people were as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in enriched networks &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;those marked by diverse, active relationships &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;reported the highest levels of self-rated health, a measure strongly associated with overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in restricted networks &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;smaller, more isolated groups centered on family &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;reported significantly poorer health. Focused networks fell in between, providing emotional support but with limited breadth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals in the restricted group reported significantly poorer health at the beginning of the study. However, by the end, both those in the restricted and the focused groups showed worse health outcomes than people in the enriched group, though the differences had narrowed, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Social isolation and loneliness can have corrosive effects on mental and physical health,” said Piedra, who is also a professor of Latina/Latino Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older adults’ social circles may shrink due to poor health, loss of loved ones, poverty, discrimination, language barriers or living in rural or unsafe communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were Black, Hispanic or from other minoritized racial and ethnic groups reported the highest levels of loneliness. Yet one of the most hopeful findings from the study was that some individuals were able to expand their networks over time, Piedra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having the smallest networks, people in the focused group reported lower loneliness than those in the restricted group, suggesting that frequent, meaningful interactions can buffer the effects of limited network size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also a high mobile group: More than 43% of people in the focused group moved into enriched networks during the study, and 22% transitioned into the more isolated restricted group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, over 85% of those who began in the restricted group remained there, highlighting the stability &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;and vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;of this network type, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you start off in a restricted network, the likelihood that you’re going to move out of it is low,” Piedra said. “Many people who are vulnerable &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;such as women and people of color &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;are more likely to see their social connections decline and become restricted over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that women, Black participants and the oldest respondents were more likely to transition from enriched to focused networks, reflecting the compounding effects of aging, widowhood and structural barriers. Loss of a spouse or close friend can trigger a rapid contraction of one’s social circle, especially for those in tight-knit networks, Piedra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re an older woman and your social life revolved around your husband, his death may cause your network to decline,” Piedra explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Similarly, living in a community with high crime, a rural area with few activities, having limited transportation or disability can all make it harder to stay socially connected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piedra said the key takeaway is that social networks are not fixed. With the right opportunities and supports older adults can build stronger, more enriching relationships despite these types of disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “That was the silver lining,” Piedra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw movement into more robust networks across all groups. That gives us reason to be hopeful. We know that these social networks are particularly important as we age and that loneliness has huge implications for cognitive and physical health. The quality of our final years becomes very problematic without an enriched social life,” Piedra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It behooves us to understand who is vulnerable and think about creating tailored public health interventions so that everyone can age well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the University of Chicago’s Center for Healthy Aging Behaviors and Longitudinal Investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this health and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c0f101a130e0e190f3c151010151213150f52191809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sharita Forrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sharita Forrest – University of Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/advance-article/doi/10.1093/geroni/igaf025/8064638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lissette Piedra et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation in Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study explores how social networks among older adults evolve over time and their impact on self-rated health (SRH), emphasizing differences across ethnoracial and linguistic groups. Though the link between social networks and well-being is well-known, how these networks change and affect health remains less understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Design and Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined changes in social network types across three rounds of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The initial sample included 3,005 individuals, which decreased to 1,592 by the final follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from participants in every round, totaling 6,858 observations, using Random-Intercept Latent Transition Analysis. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to predict network membership and transitions, and to assess correlations with SRH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified three distinct social network types: ‘Enriched,’ ‘Focused,’ and ‘Restricted.’ ‘Enriched’ networks feature broad connections, high marriage rates, active engagement, and low loneliness. ‘Focused’ networks involve small, close-knit groups with frequent interactions, moderate marriage rates, and low loneliness. ‘Restricted’ networks are family-oriented, with low marriage rates and the highest loneliness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, ‘Restricted’ networks became more prevalent, while ‘Focus’ networks showed the most mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network type membership varied significantly by ethnoracial identity and gender, with Black, Hispanic, and female respondents less likely to belong to ‘Enriched’ networks. Membership in ‘Enriched’ networks was linked to better SRH scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth of ‘Restricted’ networks over time raises concerns about older adults becoming confined to limited social environments. However, there is a silver lining: within the ‘Focused’ group, more individuals transition to ‘Enriched’ networks than to ‘Restricted’ ones, indicating that older adults can expand their social connections as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the factors driving this shift can guide interventions to promote network expansion for vulnerable groups, enhancing social well-being, and mitigating the risks associated with restricted networks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:58:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE1pRDBzRXNaTFZRbzF2cV9ZVXlac1ZyZXV2R1FWT3U1QWU0UmNOSmJkZlY0Q2xLY3hHQ2F0RFRIdWNsRmgwenR3U2thVkRVYUsxY1lITzNWeG0xcjE0bDRQOWpBcEhNdw</guid></item><item><title>经营养师测试和批准的最健康的冷冻比萨饼-雅虎 | Healthiest frozen pizzas, taste-tested and approved by a dietitian - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5hb2FxSUZWWnlWSkQxLTlpV3JJZXFnQjg1TUJza0lsQ0dkQWE5d2QwbS1QY1c2Vy1OQjV5YXZwNzdoNndLRjNjSU9DRUFzbkJmWDcyYjl6aGdlNTFhOFh1eHkydmhkNHVsdDhRakxmWDNqV0ZWeEJxTW5nNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a long week, there's nothing better than changing into sweatpants and enjoying a slice of pizza hot out of the oven.

Pairing pizza with a salad, a bowl of roasted vegetables and/or lean protein, like grilled chicken, can help round out the meal and ensure you're getting adequate amounts of important nutrients, like protein, fiber and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Han also recommends adding these nutrient boosters directly to your pizza, either before or after baking. "Top your pizza with salad greens or roasted veggies so you won't even need utensils!" she says. Brownstein offers a similar recommendation, saying you can "zhuzh up frozen pizza by topping it with extra vegetables or leftover proteins." For a quick and easy dinner, she recommends placing a pan of fresh or frozen vegetables in the oven at the same time as your pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://pnr.ouryahoo.com/story/us_commerce/2139c474-e967-4892-bee8-82e3f133252b#jump-link-table-of-contents" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:(back to top);cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;(back to top)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="factors-to-consider-when-shopping-for-frozen-pizza"&gt;Factors to consider when shopping for frozen pizza&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With many frozen pizzas being marketed as a healthier option, how do you know which ones deserve a spot in your shopping cart? Here are some key factors to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="serving-size"&gt;Serving size&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Check the pizza box to see how much of the pizza counts as a serving. Pizzas vary in diameter and thickness, and suggested serving sizes range from one-fifth of a pizza to a whole pizza. Serving sizes can be deceptive, and if you're hungry, a pizza with a small serving size might not be satisfying enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="nutrition-stats"&gt;Nutrition stats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The amount of calories, saturated fat, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-much-protein-should-i-eat-044819956.html" data-ylk="slk:protein;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and fiber you should aim for per serving depends on your health goals and what you're eating the rest of the day. That said, as a general guideline, aim for pizzas with at least 3 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein and less than 10% of the daily value for saturated fat. Sheth also suggests looking for options with around 300 to 400 calories per serving, though some people may need a higher-calorie option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="sodium-content"&gt;Sodium content&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When it comes to frozen foods, it's hard to avoid sodium completely. Not only is sodium found in the cheese and crust of frozen pizza, but this salty nutrient also helps extend the shelf life. That said, some frozen pizzas are higher in sodium than others. Smith recommends choosing a pizza with less than 650 mg of sodium per serving. She also notes that it's not always possible to find a pizza that's high in protein and fiber yet low in sodium. Instead, she recommends simply choosing a pizza that comes closest to hitting these targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="toppings"&gt;Toppings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Frozen pizzas are available with a wide range of toppings, from cheese- and meat-loaded pies to roasted veggies and vegan cheese alternatives. When looking for the healthiest frozen pizza, Brownstein recommends choosing a pizza that has some vegetables on it, "whether it's mushrooms, olives, broccoli, spinach or something else. The vegetables add some extra vitamins, minerals and fiber to help create a balanced meal." If you enjoy meat on your pizza, Sheth recommends choosing an uncured version without added nitrates/nitrites due to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9654915/#sec5-foods-11-03355" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health concerns;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health concerns&lt;/a&gt;. Plant-based "meats" can also be a good alternative, though these products can be high in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crust"&gt;Crust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Standard frozen pizzas feature crusts made with white wheat flour. While delicious, white flour crusts are typically low in fiber or other essential nutrients thanks to processing and refining. They also aren't suitable for folks with gluten allergies or sensitivities. For added fiber and protein, Han recommends opting for a crust made from chickpeas (for extra protein) or cauliflower. "These crust options also offer more fiber and are lower in carbohydrates, making them a delicious option for those looking to manage blood sugar levels," she notes. Plus, cauliflower and chickpea crusts are typically gluten-free, though you'll want to double-check the label to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://pnr.ouryahoo.com/story/us_commerce/2139c474-e967-4892-bee8-82e3f133252b#jump-link-table-of-contents" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:(back to top);cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;(back to top)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-we-chose-the-healthiest-frozen-pizzas"&gt;How we chose the healthiest frozen pizzas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To choose the healthiest frozen pizzas, I consulted four registered dietitians for their insights on which ingredients, nutrient amounts, toppings and types of frozen pizza they recommend. I also leaned on my expertise as a dietitian and experience eating frozen pizzas to select 12 healthier frozen pizzas from 11 brands to test. Each pizza was evaluated based on its nutritional profile, ingredient list, taste and texture. I also factored in taste and online reviews when deciding the top seven healthiest frozen pizzas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://pnr.ouryahoo.com/story/us_commerce/2139c474-e967-4892-bee8-82e3f133252b#jump-link-table-of-contents" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:(back to top);cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;(back to top)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="other-products-we-tested"&gt;Other products we tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every pizza we tested made the cut, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy them.

Aim for pizzas that are high in fiber and protein and contain 300 to 400 calories per serving. To round out the meal, pair your pizza with a lower-calorie veggie-packed side, like a salad or a bowl of steamed mixed vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-i-eat-frozen-pizza-regularly"&gt;Should I eat frozen pizza regularly?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Everyone has different diet goals. While some frozen pizzas are healthier than others, these foods are still more highly processed and should be enjoyed in moderation. Instead, enjoy frozen pizza as part of an overall healthy diet, including plenty of home-cooked meals and minimally processed foods, like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-frozen-pizza-highly-processed"&gt;Is frozen pizza highly processed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most frozen pizzas are highly processed.

He explains that 'people tend to dream about things they desire or fear'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, 'research has shown that dreaming and anesthesia produce different types of brain activity patterns.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A warning has been issued around popular drugs administered before surgery that can cause patients to suffer from disturbing and hyper realistic sexual fantasies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 40 million people &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691117/Woman-horrified-tampon-stuck-inside-YEAR-infection.html"&gt;undergo surgeries worldwide&lt;/a&gt; every year, so medical experts worry that this phenomenon could cause lasting psychological damage to patients and have professional repercussions for medical staff, if they are wrongly accused of assault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies even suggest that up to 18 percent of patients may have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy during or after anesthesia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common drug used for general anesthesia during surgery is Propofol, due to its rapid effect and good recovery profile, meaning that it leads to a faster return to normal consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk warns in a piece for &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-food/202505/several-sedative-drugs-may-give-you-sexual-fantasies"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'Health care professionals need to be aware of the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14668327/marriage-end-finasteride-effect.html" rel="nofollow" class=""&gt;potential risks to the patient&lt;/a&gt; and legal risks for themselves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk's concerns come off the back of research out of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-42cb55b0-2f70-11f0-be89-45a138d38e78"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at 87 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study revealed that four in ten of the reported sexual fantasies were associated with benzodiazepines and 'dose played an important role'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sexual hallucinations only happened when the two benzodiazepines - midazolam and diazepam - were administered in doses that were 'rather high'.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another case, 110 dental surgery patients reported episodes of sexual visions or sexual arousal after being administered a 'standard cocktail' of drugs which included fentanyl, diazepam, and methohexital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the patients, Dr Wenk notes that the nature of the sexual episodes varied, with 60 percent reporting that their visions happened during their surgery, while 13.3 percent said they had sexual dreams after returning home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, around 10 percent of patients said that experienced 'unpleasant sexual hallucinations' while in the recovery room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted that with many of the cases of this phenomenon happening, the 'places of the body where procedures were conducted coincided with the area of the body where the patients perceived the sexual assault or fantasy occurred'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people reported that their sexual hallucinations took a dark turn and these unpleasant visions linked to sexual assault were most associated with the use of ketamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,' Dr Wenk writes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of patients who reported disturbing sexual visions were women, Dr Wenk notes, while men had more agreeable hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discussing this finding further, he told this website: 'The males in the study often had positive sexual fantasies that occurred more often when their therapist was female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The females were more likely to experience hallucinations of sexual assault, especially if their therapist was a male (which was often the case). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Statistically, by middle age, most females are victims of some sort of sexual assault. Indeed, that experience might be the reason they seek our medical treatment and then are given one of these sedative hypnotic drugs.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this difference between the sexes, the &lt;span&gt;University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-42cb55b0-2f70-11f0-be89-45a138d38e78"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; researchers deduced that males complained about their drug-induced fantasies less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, a high number of female patients - 12 percent out of 130 - undergoing anesthesia for procedures related to the reproductive system reported experiencing 'amorous or disinhibited behaviors while sedated'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that the sex of the medical team also had an impact on patients having fantasies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk notes that in one of the reports featuring 300 predominantly male patients who were admitted for urological procedures focused on the urinary tract and male reproductive system, 'none of them reported having a sexually related dream when the surgical team was all male'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, of 40 male patients who had female anesthesiologists, one of them reported having a dream about her during his procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his piece for Psychology Today, Dr Wenk warns that benzodiazepines and propofol were not the only drugs that produced sexual fantasies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concludes: 'Dopamine agonists, such as ADHD medications and stimulants, dopamine antagonists, such as antipsychotics, and some antidepressants have also produced sexual fantasies in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dopamine-enhancing anti-Parkinson medications have been known to have a libido-stimulating effect in males.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the researchers of the original study signed off with a caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'While sexual assault hallucinations or fantasies associated with sedative hypnotics are rare, it is imperative that health care providers take the necessary precautions and follow recommendations to provide safety for themselves and their patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk told this website that the current recommendation is for doctors to warn the patient that such an experience could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he notes that 'the risk for both patient and therapist is that by warning that a hallucination could occur it might make it more likely for the patient to experience one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy due to the power of suggestion. Each therapist will have to decide which approach is best for their patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These nodules, made of decayed sensory neurons and support cells, were found in abundance in the sensory ganglia of diabetic organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals that these structures not only signal nerve degeneration but may also drive pain by sprouting aberrant, pain-sensing axons. This discovery could shift how diabetic nerve pain is treated,  moving the focus toward early neuroprotection before these nodules form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgotten Clue:&lt;/strong&gt; Nageotte nodules, long overlooked, are abundant in diabetic neuropathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; These nodules contain sprouting axons likely involved in generating pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings suggest targeting early neurodegeneration could prevent nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A phenomenon largely ignored since its discovery 100 years ago appears to be a crucial component of diabetic pain, according to new research from The University of Texas at Dallas’ Center for Advanced Pain Studies (CAPS).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings from a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; on May 5, suggest that cell clusters called Nageotte nodules are a strong indicator of nerve cell death in human sensory ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could prove to be a target for drugs that would protect these nerves or help manage diabetic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key finding of our study is really a new view of diabetic neuropathic pain,” said Dr. Ted Price BS’97, Ashbel Smith Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, CAPS director and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe our data demonstrate that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion is a critical facet of the disease — which should really force us to think about the disease in a new and urgent way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common forms of neuropathic pain and affects about 11 million people — nearly one-third of the 38 million diabetics in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It typically affects the extremities, causing sharp, shooting pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diabetic neuropathy can be debilitating,” said neuroscience research scientist Stephanie Shiers PhD’19, a co-corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109862"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a foot radiating red light, symbolizing pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treatment options are not great, and if the underlying diabetes is not managed, people may require amputation due to damage to the peripheral nerves to the point of loss of sensation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from a Research Program Cooperative Agreement grant (U19) from the National Institutes of Health, Shiers and other scientists at CAPS are mapping human dorsal root ganglia and other sensory system tissue to understand human pain mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found an abundance of these Nageotte nodules in a subset of the dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors. When I looked up the medical history on these samples, they were all from individuals with diabetes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These nodules were more prevalent in people with diabetes and even more so in those with diabetic neuropathy. Organ donors die from a range of conditions, so discovering these abnormalities in a large subset of the tissue with a similar medical history was a big break.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nageotte nodules are dead sensory neurons that have decayed, and what remains is a cluster of non-neuronal cells. They were first documented in 1922 in rabbits by the French neuroanatomist Jean Nageotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past 100 years, these nodules have been almost entirely ignored in the research literature, only appearing in about 20 papers, many of which are a half-century old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They appear to be a sign of degeneration where hyperglycemia reduces neuron viability,” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Little has been documented about these structures’ molecular composition. Virtually nobody in the pain field had heard of them, and we knew almost nothing about their involvement in pain and neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Shiers and her colleagues sought to characterize Nageotte nodules at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using histology and spatial sequencing, they demonstrated that Nageotte nodules are abundant in sensory ganglia of those with diabetic neuropathy. They are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Intertwined with the nodule is a bundle of axons: fibers of sensory neurons that look like little neuromas. The axons there appear to sprout from sensory neurons; they are pain-sensing fibers,” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This appears to be a unique pathology — something never described before in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spontaneous activity in these fibers may be what’s behind diabetic neuropathy,” Shiers said. “We also had several donors with other types of neuropathic conditions that weren’t diabetes-related, and their DRGs also had an abundance of Nageotte nodules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the rare earlier papers mentioning Nageotte nodules are mostly case studies of single individuals, this study had samples from 90 people. Shiers said her documentation of axons sprouting in this manner is also novel — another aspect of this study that represents new territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could change our basic understanding of sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are not supposed to sprout fibers from their cell bodies; they have a unique shape that we call pseudounipolar, but these diabetic sensory neurons do not look pseudounipolar — they look multipolar.” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if this morphology is pathological or if we have lacked understanding of these cells in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can study human dorsal root ganglia from such a large selection of patients due to the work of the Southwest Transplant Alliance, a nonprofit organization that recovers donated organs and tissues for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to give life to others through research is incredibly important to our donation community,” Southwest Transplant Alliance President and CEO Brad Adams said. “Knowing that your loved one’s gift led to incredible medical discoveries and advances such as this brings hope and healing to all who have lost a loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price said, “The entire study would never have happened without them. This partnership is the most important thing that enables this work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price said the research has led to new ways of thinking about neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my view, one of the most important insights we gained from this work is thinking about treating diabetic neuropathic pain differently. I think what we need to focus on now is neuroprotection at early stages of disease so that these Nageotte nodules do not form in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other UT Dallas-affiliated authors from the Department of Neuroscience include Dr. Gregory Dussor, the James Bartlett Chair in Behavioral and Brain Sciences and department head; Dr. Diana Tavares Ferreira, assistant professor; research scientists Andi Wangzhou MS’15, PhD’21, Dr. Joseph Lesnak and Ishwarya Sankaranarayanan PhD’22; doctoral student and former Green Fellow Khadijah Mazhar BS’17; and research assistant Nwasinachi Ezeji BS’20, MS’22.

thanks to a combination of missed testing, treatment and prenatal care gaps, substance use, social stigma, and testing delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the US reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis, up more than a third from 2021 and 10 times higher than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also 279 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths in 2023, the highest number reported in 30 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6130401/US-health-officials-beg-doctors-screen-pregnant-women-syphilis.html"&gt;2018 federal recommendation&lt;/a&gt; urged all pregnant women to be screened for the disease, but the USPSTF is emphasizing its importance by reissuing this recommendation given the upticks in cases and still births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are already recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women are recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. This applies to women who have been previously tested for syphilis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the UPSTF also recommended screening at 28 weeks' gestation and a third time at delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the guidance, members of the task force said: '[We] conclude with high certainty that screening for syphilis infection in pregnancy has a substantial net benefit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although men account for the majority of syphilis cases, the change in incidence among women was 2 to 4 times higher than that among men between 2017 and 2021.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis can cause severe long-term problems for the baby. They may be born too early, too small, or stillborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newborns with the infection can have life-threatening complications such as severe anemia, swollen liver and spleen, yellowing skin (jaundice), and bone deformities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can also cause brain and nerve damage, leading to inflammation of the covering around nerves, blindness, and permanent hearing loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The USPSTF said: 'A recent analysis of national data from 2022 found that 5 percent of congenital syphilis cases (197/3761 cases) occurred in late pregnancy after having had a negative syphilis screening result earlier in pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2023, states and DC reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis. This marks a 3 percent rise from 2022, following a 32 percent surge from 2021 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Similar to the disparities seen in the burden of syphilis, 40.6 percent of these cases occurred in Black women, 28.4 percent occurred in Hispanic or Latina women, and 19.8 percent occurred in White women.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some retrospective studies estimate that 25 percent to 50 percent of congenital syphilis cases could be prevented by repeat screening in the third trimester of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The task force added: Congenital syphilis increased more than 10-fold over a recent decade, from 334 cases in 2012 to 3882 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is estimated that almost 90 percent of new congenital syphilis cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can be cured in utero with consistent treatment with the antibiotic penicillin, ideally before the second trimester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that the incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and newborn infant death was dramatically reduced in pregnant women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with those who had untreated syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screening for congenital syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate repeat screening early in the third trimester and at delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During pregnancy, the body goes through many changes that can sometimes cause false positives on syphilis screening tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tests look for signs of tissue damage, not just syphilis itself. Pregnancy can trigger similar reactions because of hormonal shifts, immune system adjustments, or other conditions like autoimmune diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A positive result on the first test doesn’t always mean syphilis—it needs a second, more specific test to confirm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is spread through contact with fecal matter. Unhoused people are more likely to experience the dangerous infection given lack of easy access to handwashing and public restrooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection is also more common in women living in areas where cases are generally high, those with a history of HIV, incarceration, or sex work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve and state mandates for syphilis screening,' the task force said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's amazing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jackie's mother and sister both had breast cancer.  She has three daughters and the eldest, Danielle, also carries the inherited BRCA gene mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For my future generations, if they have got the BRCA gene, it is a new hope," Jackie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Around one in 400 people carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates about seven in 10 women with changes in these genes will develop breast cancer, compared to about one in seven women without these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrooke's and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were "really exciting". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer.  We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Abraham said a larger, multinational trial is planned next year, involving some 600 patients.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A contentious new study has found that people who live near golf courses may face a higher risk of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That does not mean that golf courses are directly causing Parkinson's, but the authors of the study, led by Brittany Krzyzanowski of the Barrow Neurological Institute in the US, have a hypothesis. They think that rampant pesticides on fairways and greens may be exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals via the air and water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's a scary prospect, to be sure, but independent experts at the non-profit Parkinson's UK, who were not involved in the current research, have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-parkinsons-disease-risk-and-proximity-to-golf-courses/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; these suspicions "reductive".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9vo_UUoGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is a complex neurological condition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;without known cause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and in recent years, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00255-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;intense debate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; has raged over whether certain pesticides may increase the risk of neurodegeneration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Farmers, for instance, tend to face &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/parkinsons-disease/can-environmental-toxins-cause-parkinson-disease"&gt;&lt;span&gt;higher risks of Parkinson's&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as do those who &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics"&gt;live in historically industrial regions&lt;/a&gt;. Studies in the lab suggest some pesticides and air pollutants can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38215-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;be toxic to brain cells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while human-made chemicals may be a &lt;a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/research-blog/research-explained/pesticides-and-parkinsons"&gt;factor in Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, so could genetics. The evidence at this point is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;not clear-cut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Many studies have investigated whether pesticides increase the risk of developing Parkinson's in different populations around the world," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-parkinsons-disease-risk-and-proximity-to-golf-courses/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Katherine Fletcher, lead researcher at Parkinson's UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The results have been varied, but overall suggest that exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of the condition. However, the evidence is not strong enough to show that pesticide exposure directly causes Parkinson's."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The newest research from Krzyzanowski and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, the University of Rochester, and the University of Kansas adds to the debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their population-based study compared 419 Parkinson's cases with 5,113 healthy individuals, matched for sex, age, and demographics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After adjusting for various neighborhood characteristics, the team found that living within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of a golf course was associated with a 126 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson's, compared to those living more than 6 miles (nearly 10 kilometers) away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, people living within water service areas containing a golf course were found to have nearly double the odds of developing Parkinson's compared to those living in golf-free areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These correlations have led Krzyzanowski and colleagues to argue that golf courses are a possible risk factor for Parkinson's disease, and that pesticides in the air and in the groundwater may contribute to that risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Public health policies to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and airborne exposure from pesticides on golf courses may help reduce risk of Parkinson's disease in nearby neighborhoods," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9198"&gt;&lt;span&gt;argue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Krzyzanowski and her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Fletcher and her colleague, David Dexter, at Parkinson's UK are unconvinced. The new study never tested for groundwater contamination near golf courses, or pollutants in the air, nor did the researchers properly control for other sources of urban air pollution, like that kicked up by road traffic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, groundwater data on pesticides around golf courses is limited, and a 2024 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsagscitech.3c00419"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that airborne pesticides are of "limited concern" to golfers, even after playing an 18-hole course &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://axial.acs.org/agriculture-and-food-chemistry/hitting-the-greens-safely-new-study-finds-low-risk-of-pesticide-exposure-for-golfers"&gt;&lt;span&gt;purposefully sprayed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Parkinson's starts in the brain 10 to 15 years before diagnosis, and the study didn't only use subjects who permanently lived in the area," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-parkinsons-disease-risk-and-proximity-to-golf-courses/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dexter in an independent comment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This would not only affect participants' exposure, but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current research elevates recent concerns around pesticides, but it is hardly a hole-in-one. Researchers will need to take quite a few more swings to prove that pesticides from golf courses are leaching into groundwater and raising the risk of Parkinson's for those living nearby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9198"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Hot flashes and night sweats. Light, heavy or skipped periods. Mood swings and brain fog. Sleepless nights. Changes to hair and skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000i3b6mm8jr2v2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These can all be symptoms of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/health/menopause-women-midlife-hormones-wellness/index.html"&gt;menopause transition&lt;/a&gt;, a natural process that a woman&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt; goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000j3b6m94tudloj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it — called perimenopause — have, until recently, been nonexistent. Women’s experience  have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000k3b6mb9rcyr9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000l3b6mimcocytk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably … 46, 47-ish,” Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “And I was starting to do my own show. ‘Full Frontal’ had just kind of started, and I was under just … immense amounts of stress, no question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000m3b6mn957dgdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And I really started to feel like I was not coping well,” she said. “My body was changing — I was having physical changes — and I actually, literally didn’t know what was happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000n3b6m1fpjg359@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and later with her own series, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didn’t feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides “roiling.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000o3b6m4kxbjn35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was “going crazy” because of her job.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000p3b6mts1ck2o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasn’t sleeping well and “turning into Lady Macbeth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000q3b6m5vsiy9he@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And she was like, ‘Oh, you’re in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/health/perimenopause-menopause-wellness/index.html"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.’ And I was like, ‘There’s a word?’” Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadn’t really broken the surface of popular culture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000r3b6mem1oa7fg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ‘Yeah!’ But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,” she recalled. “Nobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, don’t come out. … I would never in a million years have thought, ‘Oh, I’m in perimenopause.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Bee’s most recent project, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Studios-on-Brilliance-Menopause/dp/B0DXQJNDTR" target="_blank"&gt;How to Survive Menopause&lt;/a&gt;,” was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400113b6m34c4ed7i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her “on a path of knowledge.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400123b6mhimivt11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re de-pubertizing,” Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: “‘Remember all the torment you felt … when you were 15 and … every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ‘That’s what that is, but just in the other direction.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400133b6mtuvjcoug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, “is that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if it’s just one person.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400143b6mc9mheev1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just saying the words out loud and  normalizing it. It’s normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,” she said. “It’s good to make a joke about. It’s good to say  it out loud. That’s actually the main thing that has helped me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400153b6myh178k7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. “I don’t like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400163b6miqry9oe6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called “the internet’s gynecologist,” Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Menopause-Manifesto-Health-Facts-Feminism/dp/0806540664/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"&gt;The Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health With Facts and Feminism&lt;/a&gt;,” is known for debunking myths about this stage of life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400173b6mida9d7mo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because it’s kind of cleaning itself out,” Bee said. “It’s kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400183b6mffxj8wtl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter, who said she likes to call it the “menopause experience” or the “menopause continuum,” agreed that we don’t talk enough about perimenopause and menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400193b6mw2fc8qtm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve never heard about it, how would you really know what’s going on with your body?” she told Tirrell&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalnhfyb00003b6mm6axkyjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmalmxi23001k3b6mqyyrk4ow@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001a3b6mmc81mngf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,” she said. “But also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001b3b6mebx4a3o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. “So, there’s a combination of reasons that a lot of people don’t realize that’s what it is until they’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001c3b6myocs9k0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;How &lt;/em&gt;menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001d3b6mcj2n1g27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “How you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,” Gunter pointed out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001e3b6mykargdqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It means that we have a mind-body experience,” she said. “Everybody around you is telling you that you’re an ugly old hag whose ‘time has come,’ and all you’re seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. … You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001f3b6mhhfeaxto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. “They have ‘erectile dysfunction.’ We don’t say ‘penile failure,’” Gunter said. “If we talked about men’s bodies the way we talked about women’s bodies, &lt;em&gt;woof&lt;/em&gt;, that would be a whole different ball game.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmy05t001n3b6mfao7k1hd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunter’s top five facts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001s3b6mzbxz6gg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause marks the end of an individual’s reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. “This is when ovulation stops,” Gunter said via email. “This means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001t3b6m5f7kxj57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the progress is not gradual or linear. “Hormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001u3b6mbhzeg32d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Remember the chaos of puberty? “Think of menopause like puberty in reverse,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001v3b6math2djrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/menopause/what-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause transition typically starts&lt;/a&gt; at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. “The average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001w3b6m3j4mhtk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,” she added via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001x3b6mv4wm2601@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, everybody is different, which makes it  an unpredictable ride.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001y3b6mh3s418hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. “Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3   years away,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001z3b6mvpz09a22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isn’t even needed for the diagnosis. “If you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00203b6m1v8eakpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But sometimes more testing is required. “Blood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3   months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40-  44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00213b6mxwi3srv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who don’t get their periods for other reasons — due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy — Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmalmz29s002l3b6m06oy1y9g@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="symptoms-and-medical-concerns" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Symptoms and medical concerns
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00223b6mfgyd1b2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00233b6m40umc9a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The most  common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00243b6ma4fa435s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,” she noted. “Depression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00253b6mlwejqoui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. “The risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so it’s important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00273b6mj1xk4jea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank"&gt;Menopause hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,” she said via email. “Hormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended    as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00283b6mtp28zr0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Should all women entering menopause be on it? “We do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that)   it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,” Gunter explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet.  She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002b3b6mvmqncaa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,” she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard   by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you don’t already enjoy these activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002c3b6mssz5pm89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/what-counts.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements    as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002f3b6mi4w4ayjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as &lt;a href="https://www.usp.org/dietary-supplements-herbal-medicines" target="_blank"&gt;US Pharmacopeia&lt;/a&gt; (USP) or the &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/articles/supplement-vitamin-certification" target="_blank"&gt;NSF&lt;/a&gt; (the National Sanitation Foundation).
    &lt;/p&gt;

The adverse effects on quality of life appear to be amplified by dysfunctional efforts to manage the intense emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD under the influence of alcohol. The research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395624007143"&gt;Journal of Psychiatric Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder is a chronic condition marked by an inability to control alcohol consumption despite harmful consequences, resulting in significant distress or impairment. It involves a pattern of excessive drinking, strong cravings, and a loss of control over alcohol intake. Individuals with this disorder often experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea when not drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of alcohol use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the number of symptoms present. Over time, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver disease, cardiovascular complications, and cognitive decline. Social and occupational functioning often deteriorates as individuals begin to neglect responsibilities and relationships due to their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Amandine Luquiens and her colleagues aimed to examine how alcohol use affects quality of life in individuals with ADHD. In particular, they focused on the roles of impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life. It typically begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood, affecting academic, occupational, and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the beginning of the TRAIN study, a clinical trial in France investigating the efficacy of a cognitive training program for patients with alcohol use disorder. The sample included 206 individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, 40 of whom also had ADHD. All participants were classified as being at high risk due to their drinking levels—defined as consuming over 60 grams of alcohol per day for men and over 40 grams per day for women during the previous four-week period. At the time of the study, participants had been abstinent for between 7 and 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a series of assessments measuring ADHD symptoms (using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), health-related quality of life specific to alcohol use disorder (using the Alcohol Quality of Life Scale), impulsivity (using the Impulsive Behavior Scale), emotion regulation strategies (using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), emotion regulation difficulties (using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – Impulse Control Difficulties subscale), and alcohol-related cognitive impairment (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that alcohol use had a greater negative impact on quality of life in individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder. Participants who were highly impulsive or who had difficulties with emotional regulation tended to report lower quality of life as well. Individuals with ADHD were more likely to suppress emotional expression, which was associated with further declines in quality of life. Overall, the researchers concluded that dysfunctional efforts to cope with emotional dysregulation significantly contributed to reduced well-being in individuals with ADHD and alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings have direct clinical and therapeutic implications. They underscore the relevance of identifying patients’ preferred emotion regulation strategies and the need to work with them on the limits of expressive suppression in the context of ADHD in AUD [alcohol use disorder], and on more functional and less costly alternatives,” the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the specificities of the relationship between alcohol use and quality of life in individuals with alcohol use disorder who also suffer from ADHD. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.12.012"&gt;ADHD and alcohol: Emotional regulation efforts pay off in quality of life points,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Amandine Luquiens, Thibault Mura, Alexandra Dereux, Patrice Louville, Helene Donnadieu, Marie Bronnec, Amine Benyamina, Pascal Perney, and Arnaud Carre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 14:01:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPNFFsZWZVUnBUQ1gxc3VzaUJWWWk3dHJaTjFSNWptaHVfWDhGdU9MZFUteFpLanR0TW8tN0QwSmVMaXB6cVNrVUVETHBUWGdaVk1DbmYyY2dfTjhrN1J1WTNTVE9LSlhDbE5zanl3T3RNV2RaY0hRRWdSQUxKTHVIUm8wMFhKcU5sUVZoNHBnYnZFXzgwZ3ZLckZB</guid></item><item><title>睡眠呼吸暂停随着时间的推移侵蚀记忆-神经科学新闻 | Sleep Apnea Erodes Memory Over Time - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1jaU9LYjg4WTBpNDNIZlBqWUhWT2xOMi1ucUFObFl5TU5id05OM252bThxQmJzOThFYUY1UVJsd1BrTDlwRGlTRmVQWnUwa0lmdlp1OVNGN2JLdlA3UVZMWUhNSFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contributes to significant memory decline, especially in visual and verbal working memory, according to a new review of human and animal studies. Key features of OSA, intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, drive brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal injury, impairing memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity and duration of OSA correlate strongly with worse memory performance, with biomarkers like the Oxygen Desaturation Index offering measurable insight. While CPAP remains the frontline treatment, researchers call for better diagnostics and emerging therapies to address this underrecognized cognitive impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; OSA triggers neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory impairment severity correlates with OSA intensity and duration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; CPAP helps but new diagnostics and therapies are needed for full cognitive protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Marshall University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), commonly associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, also plays a significant but less recognized role in memory decline, according to a new review published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Marshall University Joan C.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They report that key features of OSA—intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation (SF)—trigger biological processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal injury, altered synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease severity and duration are strongly linked to poorer memory performance, with measures like the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) correlating with the extent of impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy remains the most effective treatment for protecting cognitive function, the authors stress the need for additional therapies and more precise diagnostic tools to identify and manage OSA-related memory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early changes observed through brain imaging, EEG, and blood biomarkers may serve as emerging predictors of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review was co-authored by Drs. Xiaoman Zhang, Huajun Xu, and Shankai Yin of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Drs. David Gozal and Abdelnaby Khalyfa of Marshall University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang completed a six-month research scholar program in Khalyfa’s lab at Marshall University, collaborating with Khalyfa and the team to develop this review article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlight future research directions, including the role of gut microbiota, genetic factors, and epigenetic changes in OSA-related memory decline. They suggest that multidimensional clinical profiling could support the development of personalized treatment strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China (STI2030-Major Projects 2021ZD0201900), the National Institutes of Health (HL166617, HL169266), and the Joan C.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MURRAY — Ann Itchon says she will never forget the sound of her husband falling in the bathroom the night he suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 23, 2024, Ted Itchon woke up around 2 a.m. to use the bathroom and lost his balance, causing him to collapse onto the floor. Ann found him quickly after and called 911. She says she had no idea what was wrong until she overheard a paramedic saying Ted might be having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time it took Ann Itchon to leave their house and meet her husband at the hospital emergency room, first responders had already assessed Ted and provided him a stroke-stopping medication that prevented further damage to his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Johnson, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Program at Intermountain Medical Center, and the neurologist who treated Ted Itchon that night, explained that medical staff work as fast as possible when treating a stroke patient because, for every second they are experiencing a stroke, 32,000 neurons in the brain die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A stroke is a very time-sensitive disease. When somebody is having a stroke, it's just a matter of time until you have a permanent brain injury," said Johnson. "We often say, in the stroke world, that 'time is brain.' Every minute you delay care, it costs brain cells. The sooner somebody comes into the hospital, the sooner we can intervene and prevent that injury from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah was recently ranked as the top state for providing the fastest stroke treatment in the nation by the American Heart Association, according to &lt;a href="https://news.intermountainhealth.org/new-report-finds-utahns-getting-fastest-stroke-treatment-in-nation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Intermountain Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends that patients receive a tissue plasminogen activator medication to dissolve blood clots in the brain within 60 minutes of arriving at the hospital. In Utah, 87.1% of stroke patients received the medication within 45 minutes of their arrival, making it the only state in the country reaching that goal for over 85% of patients. Furthermore, Intermountain Health reports 94.5% of patients arriving at its stroke centers receive the medication within 45 minutes, and 88% receive it in 30 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve its door-to-needle time, Johnson says Intermountain Health has implemented changes such as having the blood clot-dissolving medication premixed, expediting CT scans, and improving the emergency department workflow overall. The health care system also has a stroke neurologist on staff 24/7 to ensure patients can be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been able to treat patients very quickly because we — along with our sister hospitals in the state — have focused very intensely on assessing patients, when they come to the hospitals, as quickly as possible," said Johnson. "We have worked very closely with EMS crews, with the ER doctors, with our nurses in the ER, to make sure that we shave off every minute that we can ... so that when a patient like Ted comes in, we are very quickly able to get the data that we need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient arrives at the emergency room, medical staff must be able to determine definitively that the patient is having a stroke before administering the medication to stop it. They also need to verify the patient's medical history and what medications they may be taking to ensure nothing will interfere with the stroke treatment medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ted Ichton's case, doctors also had to perform a thrombectomy, or surgical procedure to remove blood clots from arteries in the brain, in addition to administering the tissue plasminogen activator medication. Because his specialized stroke team was able to move so quickly in treating him, Ted Itchon says most people he meets don't even know he suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't tell you how much I appreciate the doctors. They were fantastic, and I enjoyed them, even though I wanted to get out (of the hospital). I don't even know how to explain the gratitude I have," he said. "If it wasn't for Ann and her diligence, her quickness of calling 911, I would probably be less than what I am now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Itchon was able to return home just four days after his stroke. While he still required outpatient physical therapy sessions to help him recover some speech skills and treat his foot that was affected by the stroke, Johnson says Ted Itchon experienced a relatively speedy recovery thanks to the quick door-to-needle time he received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery, preventing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, which can result in the death of brain cells. Strokes are most common in older adults — especially those with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes — but can happen to anyone, according to Johnson. As strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S., he encourages people to be informed so they can help themselves or loved ones suffering from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always like to remind people that we use the mnemonic device BEFAST to remind patients and the public what to look out for for a stroke: sudden severe balance problems, eye problems — so vision loss on one side or the other — facial droop, arm weakness, speech problems .. and then 'T' is time, so time to call 911 and time to come in and seek treatment," said Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After calling 911, Johnson says one of the best things a loved one can do to expedite the door-to-needle time for someone suffering from a stroke is to know what medications they take and be prepared to provide their medical history. Most stroke patients are unable to speak clearly or coherently, so having a family member or friend's number to contact for information can help first responders and hospital staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, prevention can be the best medicine for some stroke patients, according to Johnson. While not all strokes are preventable, 80% are if patients receive treatment for conditions that make them higher risk for stroke, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on stroke risk or recovery, visit the American Heart Association's &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;stroke website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes has &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/malnutrition-related-diabetes-officially-named-type-5-2025a10008pd"&gt;just been recognised&lt;/a&gt; as a distinct form of diabetes by the International Diabetes Federation. Despite the name, there are more than a dozen different types of diabetes. The classification isn’t quite as tidy as the numbering suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a clear guide to the different types, including some that you may not have heard of, along with information about what causes them and how they are treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Type 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes is caused by the body’s immune system mistakenly attacking the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This autoimmune reaction can occur at any age, from infancy through to old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not linked to diet or lifestyle. Instead, it probably results from a combination of &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/type-1-diabetes/causes"&gt;genetic predisposition and environmental triggers&lt;/a&gt;, such as viral infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment involves lifelong insulin therapy, delivered through injections or pumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small number of people who struggle with low blood sugars, called hypoglycaemia, can receive new cells in the pancreas that produce insulin from &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/islet-cell-transplants"&gt;deceased donors&lt;/a&gt;. For many, this reduces the number of insulin injections needed. Some can stop taking their insulin altogether. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, dozens of people have now received stem-cell-derived transplants to effectively &lt;a href="https://type1diabetesgrandchallenge.org.uk/news/views/what-are-beta-cell-therapies-and-do-they-offer-hope-for-a-cure-for-type-1-diabetes/"&gt;“cure” their diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, although people still need to take strong immune-suppressing drugs. This treatment is not yet widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Type 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition and is often linked to having a high BMI (body mass index). However, it can also affect people of normal weight, particularly those with a strong &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07019-6"&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain ethnic groups, including south Asians and people of African and Caribbean descent, are at higher risk – even at lower body weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boosting the body’s production of insulin can help to control blood sugar levels.  Some drugs boost insulin production from the pancreas, while others improve insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/metformin/about-metformin/"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is taken by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This drug improves insulin sensitivity and switches off sugar production by the liver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of different drugs to help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. Tailoring treatment to the individual has been shown to improve health outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes can also reverse diabetes. This can be done by keeping a low-calorie diet of 800 calories a day. In a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)33102-1/fulltext#seccestitle10"&gt;research trial&lt;/a&gt;  maintaining this diet for 12 months reversed diabetes in 46% of people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gestational diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of diabetes &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/"&gt;develops during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, typically between weeks 24 and 28. It is triggered by hormonal changes that reduce the body’s sensitivity to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include being overweight or obese, a family history of diabetes, and giving birth to a large baby in a previous pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those from Middle Eastern, south Asian, black and African Caribbean backgrounds are also at higher risk of gestational diabetes. Age is also a factor, as insulin sensitivity declines with age. This can be treated with diet and exercise, tablets or insulin injections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Gestational diabetes usually develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/pregnant-woman-eating-fuit-home-beautiful-2224215461"&gt;Just Life/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rarer forms of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/rare-forms-of-diabetes/"&gt;at least nine sub-types of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; that include rare genetic forms, sometimes caused by a single genetic change. Others can be caused by treatment, such as surgery or drugs, such as steroids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neonatal diabetes appears early in life. Some of the genetic changes affect how insulin is released from the pancreas. Some people still make their own insulin, so can be treated with tablets that help pancreas cells to push out insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maturity onset diabetes of the young, or Mody, occurs later in life and is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/other-types-of-diabetes/mody?gad_campaignid=15219795553&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4IfZUqYeNZqV85bFnIuyia75wR3"&gt;genetic changes&lt;/a&gt;. There are several gene changes, with some affecting how pancreas cells sense sugar and others affecting how the pancreas develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 3c diabetes is different. It is caused by damage to the pancreas. People with pancreatic cancer, for example, can develop diabetes after parts of the pancreas are removed. It can also develop after pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with cystic fibrosis are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes. This is called cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. The risk increases with age and is very common, with around a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081545"&gt;third of people&lt;/a&gt; with cystic fibrosis developing diabetes by the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Type 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This newly designated form is linked to malnutrition during early life. Type 5 diabetes is more common in poorer countries. It affects around &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/"&gt;20-25 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have low body weight and lack insulin. But the lack of insulin is not caused by the immune system. Instead, the body may not have received the correct nutrition during childhood to help the pancreas develop normally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2178691/"&gt;rodents&lt;/a&gt; have shown that a low-protein diet during pregnancy or adolescence leads to poor pancreas development. This has been known for many years. Having a smaller pancreas is a risk factor for different forms of diabetes. Essentially, having fewer reserves of insulin-producing cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that result in raised blood sugar levels, but the underlying causes vary widely. Understanding the specific types of diabetes someone has is crucial to providing the right treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As medical science evolves, so does the classification of diabetes. Recognising malnutrition-related diabetes as type 5 will stimulate discussion. This is a step towards better global understanding and care – especially in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001011"&gt;Obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; has many unknowns, including what causes it, why symptoms can differ so much between people, how medication and therapy for it actually work, and why treatment is effective for some people and not for others. In our newly published research, my colleagues and I made a step toward unraveling some of these mysteries by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;shedding light on the genetics of OCD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obsessive compulsive disorder is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001011"&gt;most impairing illnesses&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Affecting about 1 in 50 people globally, OCD is among the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/depression-global-health-estimates"&gt;top 10 causes&lt;/a&gt; of years lost to disability, leading to harmful effects on a person’s ability to work and function in the world and on their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with people without OCD, a person with the condition has a 30% &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-077564"&gt;higher chance of dying prematurely&lt;/a&gt; from natural causes, such as infections or other illnesses, and a 300% higher chance of dying early from nonnatural causes, such as accidents or suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with OCD experience obsessions – disturbing, recurrent and unwanted thoughts, fears or mental images – and compulsions, such as repetitive behaviors and rituals performed to ease the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder"&gt;anxiety usually caused by obsessions&lt;/a&gt;. For example, someone might wash their hands dozens of times or in a specific way to get rid of germs, even if they know it’s excessive or illogical. Avoiding certain places or situations to reduce anxiety or prevent triggering obsessions and compulsions is also common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/666883/original/file-20250508-62-b8nkuq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;People with OCD have compulsions that interfere with their daily lives to a debilitating degree.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/closeup-woman-washing-hands-in-kitchen-sink-royalty-free-image/1221553735"&gt;Jena Ardell/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact causes of OCD are unclear, researchers know that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development. OCD can run in families; studies attribute &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001744"&gt;between 40% to 65%&lt;/a&gt; of OCD cases to genetic factors. OCD that begins in childhood has a stronger genetic influence than OCD that begins in adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unlike some genetic diseases caused by a single faulty gene, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis/causes"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/huntingtons-disease"&gt;Huntington’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, OCD is influenced by hundreds to thousands of genes that each play a small part in disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I analyzed the DNA of over 53,000 people with OCD and over 2 million people without OCD, the largest study of this kind for this condition. We discovered &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;hundreds of genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; potentially linked to OCD – data we hope will ultimately lead to improved ways of identifying people who are at risk for OCD and, down the line, to better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How scientists study OCD genetics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the genes involved in OCD risk, researchers use a method called a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg1521"&gt;genome-wide association study, or GWAS&lt;/a&gt;. These studies compare the DNA of tens to hundreds of thousands of people with a disease of interest with the DNA of people without the disease, looking for tiny differences in the genetic material. These genetic markers may be linked to OCD or indicate the presence of other genes linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a GWAS, scientists carefully test each of the millions of genetic markers across the genome to identify those found more often in people with OCD than in people without OCD. They then determine which genes those markers are associated with, where in the body they are active and how they might contribute to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;GWAS studies look for genetic associations between different traits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified 30 areas in the genome linked to OCD, containing 249 genes of interest in total. Of those, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;25 genes stood out&lt;/a&gt; as likely contributors to the development of OCD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three genes we found are also linked to other brain disorders such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001744"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xhgg.2024.100377"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.47626/1516-4446-2023-3322"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. Several other genes of interest for OCD were found in a region of the genome that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-immunol-051116-052450"&gt;plays a role in adaptive immunity&lt;/a&gt; and has been associated with other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, no single gene can predict or cause OCD on its own. Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that genes across &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003864"&gt;all of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.b.32687"&gt;23 pairs&lt;/a&gt; of chromosomes in people may contribute to OCD risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Genetic insights into OCD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the contribution of each genetic marker or gene to disease susceptibility is very small, GWAS are not useful for identifying genes that cause OCD for a given person. Rather, this kind of research helps scientists understand how the brain works in people with OCD and whether OCD shares genetic roots with conditions that commonly occur alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the genetic markers we found to be associated with OCD were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;highly active&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12264-024-01252-9"&gt;several brain regions&lt;/a&gt; known to play a role in development of the condition. These brain areas are collectively involved in planning, decision-making, motivation, error detection, emotion regulation, and fear and anxiety, all of which can malfunction in OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found associations with a brain region &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09727531241255492"&gt;called the hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt;, which converts emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety or excitement into physical responses. The hypothalamus has not been directly linked to OCD before, but it is part of a network of brain regions that may contribute to its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found that certain types of brain cells – particularly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.11.023"&gt;medium spiny neurons&lt;/a&gt; in a brain region called the striatum – were strongly linked to the OCD genes we identified. Medium spiny neurons play an important role in habit formation, the process by which a behavior becomes automatic and habitual – think compulsions. Specific receptors on medium spiny neurons are common targets for medications that are sometimes used to help treat OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/666885/original/file-20250508-56-mwovv9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Many people with OCD also suffer from anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/close-up-of-woman-picking-at-cuticles-skin-picking-royalty-free-image/2201777511"&gt;triocean/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of our study can help researchers better understand the relationships between OCD and other conditions. We found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;genetic links&lt;/a&gt; between OCD and several other psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety, depression, anorexia and Tourette syndrome. People with OCD also showed lower genetic risk for conditions such as alcohol dependence and risk-taking behavior, aligning with what doctors see in clinics: Many people with OCD tend to be cautious and avoid risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we also found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02189-z"&gt;genetic overlaps&lt;/a&gt; between OCD immune-related conditions. While having OCD appears to be linked to an increased risk of asthma and migraines, it may also be linked to a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel disease. These findings may lead to new insights about the role the immune system and inflammation play in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More effective OCD treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCD is a complex disorder that can look very different from person to person. Understanding the genetic and biological factors behind OCD helps researchers move closer to better diagnosis, treatment and possibly even prevention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.ufl.edu/profile/mathews-carol/"&gt;practicing psychiatrist and researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I have spent my career working to understand the causes of OCD and to improve the lives of those who live with the condition. With larger studies and continued research, my team and I hope to better match specific biological patterns to individual symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, this could lead to more personalized and effective treatments – improving the lives of millions of people living with OCD around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Here's The Answer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're going to cut right to the chase: Logistically speaking, 10,000 steps a day equates to approximately five miles. But, there may be some variance in that based on your stride, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/natalyavasquezcoaching/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalya Vasquez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalya Vasquez&lt;/a&gt;, CPT, a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of Bridal Bootcamp San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, how long it will take you to get in this many steps is also pretty individualized: “If you’re walking at a moderate pace of approximately 3.0 mph, or 20 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 40 minutes to walk five miles, but if you walk at a faster pace of 4.0 mph or approximately 15 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 15 minutes to walk five miles,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is 10,000 steps even a magic number or nah?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short answer: Not really. But it takes some explaining. The recommendation originated from a Japanese company’s 1960s marketing campaign for their pedometer, says Vasquez. “The name of their pedometer translated into ‘10,000 steps,’ and at the time, there was no research to substantiate the claim that 10,000 steps was the gold-standard, but they simply set a higher bar for their population to encourage healthier behavior,” she says. (The translation was actually '10,000 step meter' and WH took a deep dive into the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10,000 steps myth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;10,000 steps myth&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested in joining us in this rabbit hole.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's absolutely not up for debate is that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking is great exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking is great exercise&lt;/a&gt; for anyone with lower-body mobility since it’s low-impact and can be easily modified with speed and intensity, says Vasquez. (Also: It's very &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a64732856/how-to-lose-weight-fast-naturally-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:underrated as a form of weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;underrated as a form of weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, if that's your goal.) It can also &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19982843/best-leg-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase muscle definition in your legs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increase muscle definition in your legs&lt;/a&gt;, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you’re fairly inactive and currently get something like 2,000 steps per day, immediately jumping to a number such as 10,000 can be unrealistic and even unsafe, so Vasquez recommends gradually adding steps so your muscles and joints have time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So how much walking is truly enough per day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t one universal answer on how many steps a day is “enough,” because it depends on your ability, current fitness level, and time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the sweet spot for lowering the risk of disease and premature death is walking between 7,000 to 8,000 steps a day, and anything more than that may plateau benefits, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/10/231026131551.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Granada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want more walking inspo?

Break up your step goal throughout the day and go for small 15- to 20-minute &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64526723/is-walking-enough-to-count-as-a-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt; when possible to make it less daunting, says Vasquez. Whether you pace while on a work call, walk your dog around the block, or park further away from the store, get creative with your steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton

But our sterile, urbanized lifestyles, appear to have made them less diverse overall and, therefore, weaker, according to Kinross, who is based at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing a generational loss in our internal ecology, which is being hammered with a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;series of environmental hits&lt;/a&gt; that it simply cannot adapt to," he said, referring to factors including microplastics, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-studies-ultra-processed-foods-rules-to-stop-overeating-simple-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and minimal access to nature. Many studies have linked&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;these changes in the gut microbiome to an increase in colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the gut microbiome is changeable, meaning there are things we can do to increase its diversity, which in turn could help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lower colon cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. "It is an ecosystem which you can adapt, and you can modify," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinross previously shared with BI how he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prevent-colon-cancer-gi-doctor-research-gut-microbiome-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eats to boost his gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. He shared the three things he does aside from healthy eating to lower his colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d7945330-e9b0-4292-8a5c-bb08697abd00" data-toc-id="d7945330-e9b0-4292-8a5c-bb08697abd00"&gt;Don't take antibiotics if you don't need to&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a surgeon, Kinross is acutely aware that antibiotics are often necessary and save millions of lives each year, but he believes we use them too liberally — particularly to treat viral infections they can't tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my house, to qualify for antibiotics, you've really got to have a pathogen that you need treated," Kinross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinross and his family limit their &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/treatments/how-long-does-it-take-for-antibiotics-to-work" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;use of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible because taking them can disrupt the ecosystem of the gut microbiome, killing off good bacteria along with pathogens, and reducing diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He likened it to pouring weed killer all over your garden. "Your &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-gut-health-gut-gardening-brain-immune-system-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;garden won't really grow &lt;/a&gt;into a lovely garden full of wild meadows and flowers and color. It will just be brown and lifeless," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2de07f37-3b60-4f69-9368-d23e13e90192" data-toc-id="2de07f37-3b60-4f69-9368-d23e13e90192"&gt;Take vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinross takes a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-researches-healthy-aging-takes-supplements-daily-vitamin-d-creatine-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; because evidence suggests that having enough of the nutrient is important for gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is crucial for several biological processes, including calcium absorption and cellular repair — but also keeps the lining of the small intestine strong. If the lining becomes weak, microbes can pass through it into the bloodstream and cause inflammation. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is linked to a higher risk of chronic diseases, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is found in foods including oily fish, egg yolks, and red meat, as well as from sunlight. In countries with climates like the UK's, where Kinross lives, it can be difficult to get enough vitamin D in the colder months, and residents are advised to supplement from October to March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0d0efa6e-33ba-45b2-93c4-5815ea03bf79" data-toc-id="0d0efa6e-33ba-45b2-93c4-5815ea03bf79"&gt;Socialize&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kinross goes cycling with friends regularly and makes sure to sit down to eat dinner with his family in the evenings. As well as being a pillar of overall health, research suggests that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-social-isolation-affects-your-health-2016-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;socializing&lt;/a&gt; positively impacts the composition of our gut microbiomes, Kinross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We exchange microbes through physical touch, and studies have found that friends, family members, and spouses have similar gut microbes to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=bed7d526fb9acded026bd29497f07ea1d534ef5e246ad32cb46165187f9b208f&amp;amp;platform=browser&amp;amp;postID=67f541f818fa5330630fdc28&amp;amp;postSlug=how-gi-doctor-prevent-colon-cancer-eating-healthy-gut-microbiome-2025-5&amp;amp;site=bi&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-024-08222-1" data-track-click-secondary='{"event":"outbound_affiliate_click","element_name":"body_link","brand_name":"bi_value_unassigned","deal_price":"bi_value_unassigned","depth":"bi_value_unassigned","index":"bi_value_unassigned","number_purchase_options":"bi_value_unassigned","price":"bi_value_unassigned","product_badge":"bi_value_unassigned","product_category":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned","product_id":"bi_value_unassigned","product_name":"bi_value_unassigned","purchase_options_index":"bi_value_unassigned","retailer_name":"bi_value_unassigned"}' data-track-click='{"click_type":"affiliate","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=bed7d526fb9acded026bd29497f07ea1d534ef5e246ad32cb46165187f9b208f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-024-08222-1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, based on 1,787 adults from 18 isolated villages in Honduras, found that people in the same social network shared more similarities in their gut microbiomes compared to those outside of it. This was regardless of diet, water sources, and medications. Spouses and people living together had the highest amount of microbial sharing, but the phenomenon still occurred among friends and even friends of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our social interactions, our real-world social interactions, define so much of our health," Kinross said. "It's good for all aspects of our health. It's good for our mental health, it's good for our cardiovascular health. It's good for everything. But if you're not having real-world social interaction, you are not really optimizing your gut health, I believe."&lt;/p&gt;

Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get your blood pressure checked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Complete Alzheimer's UK’s Think Brain Health Check-in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would suggest that everybody does our Think Brain Health Check-in,” recommends Schott. “It’s been used by over half a million people in the UK, and you can go in and you can put in your own personal circumstances, and it’ll ask you questions about things like exercise, smoking, diet and alcohol, and will come up with some easy-to-follow advice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join Alzheimer’s Research UK this summer with the return of Walk For A Cure, a series of accessible, 5km, nationwide walking events.

In some cases, the average blood pressure-lowering effects were comparable to those seen with some medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols were also found to improve the function of the endothelium - the inner lining of blood vessels - which is crucial for overall cardiovascular health. This improvement occurred independently of blood pressure changes, suggesting a broader positive impact on the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31509875" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Christian Heiss, lead-author of the study and Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Surrey, said: "The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes. Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPMGtGNVc3OXFpdVZ5TXktcXNVYl9KMHRjOW4tV0FRblFhYkU1TlhtY2RDOEppLUR3RlE3SVZZUFAtdXYtX3FhU0NId1FJY2RFNDdBN3h1THVHcXVKYTdpZEpobHpBY0c0Vl9Xb1hYdHRDc21yYU9ucWV6Y0lraVZ4NUtNMzc</guid></item><item><title>肺癌：一项研究发现我们的盘子上有一个意想不到的杀手！ -银河日报 | Lung Cancer: A Study Uncovers an Unsuspected Killer on Our Plates! - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPajNyeVBHb0Z2TFliR2hwTjQ5OVJvb2t6ZUxjMlprSHZQdHRvNnVrWlFuWWs0SERaRDFwWXUtQ2Jrb1VmNkVvZ0NiOVV3MEdLbElOZHpwZ3pLcDRuY0kzNmMzYXo4S3lIZE9XLXJJaHltTFVQSDJsZzVsejNvck85WFRNNGNRcm1JbmNmVmF5RVlqQjlOZU9KejY0SmxCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has uncovered an unexpected connection between our diets and the progression of &lt;strong&gt;lung cancer,&lt;/strong&gt; specifically a common type known as&lt;strong&gt; pulmonary adenocarcinoma (LUAD)&lt;/strong&gt;. While smoking and environmental factors have long been linked to the disease, this new research shines a light on a surprising dietary factor that could contribute to the growth of lung cancer cells. The study points to &lt;strong&gt;glycogen&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecule typically associated with energy storage, as a potential culprit in accelerating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen Accumulation in Lung Cancer Cells&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01243-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was conducted by researchers at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the &lt;em&gt;University of Florida&lt;/em&gt;. The scientists focused on &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/what-happens-to-body-after-7-days-fasting/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a form of glucose stored in the body as an energy reserve. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that &lt;strong&gt;glycogen accumulates in large amounts in the tissues of patients with LUAD&lt;/strong&gt;, and the presence of higher glycogen levels was linked to faster tumor growth. The researchers used &lt;strong&gt;spatial metabolomics&lt;/strong&gt;, an advanced technology that allows for the mapping of molecules directly within tissues, to study the effects of glycogen on lung cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of glycogen appears to play a critical role in the development of LUAD, acting as a fuel source for the cancer cells. The more glycogen present, the more aggressive the tumor growth becomes. This discovery points to a potential new area for research, suggesting that glycogen could be a factor in how the disease progresses, beyond the well-known environmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of the Western Diet in Cancer Growth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the influence of the &lt;strong&gt;Western diet&lt;/strong&gt;, which is typically rich in fats and sugars, on the growth of lung cancer. In a series of experiments, the researchers fed mice a diet high in fats and sugars, mimicking the eating habits common in Western countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: the mice with elevated glycogen levels in their lung tissues showed &lt;strong&gt;significantly faster tumor growth&lt;/strong&gt; compared to those with lower glycogen levels. This experiment suggests that the excess sugars and fats in the diet may contribute to the buildup of glycogen, which in turn accelerates the development of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings point to an alarming possibility: the foods we eat may be acting as a fuel source for cancer cells, particularly in lung cancer. As glycogen is found to be more abundant in the lungs of cancer patients, the connection between diet and disease progression becomes increasingly evident. This study underscores the importance of considering diet as a factor in cancer development and progression, adding a new dimension to our understanding of lung cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen as a Biomarker for Lung Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to its role in cancer progression, glycogen could become a useful &lt;strong&gt;biomarker&lt;/strong&gt; for monitoring the development of LUAD. By tracking glycogen levels in lung tissues, doctors could potentially assess the severity of the disease and even predict how quickly a tumor might grow. This opens the door to more personalized and effective treatment options, as doctors could tailor interventions based on the glycogen levels in a patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if glycogen proves to be a reliable marker, it could serve as a new target for &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic interventions&lt;/strong&gt;, providing a way to slow or stop tumor growth. The ability to monitor glycogen levels could also lead to more accurate predictions regarding patient outcomes and the efficacy of various treatments. Researchers are now exploring whether reducing glycogen in the lungs could help slow the progression of lung cancer, offering hope for more targeted therapies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Lung Cancer Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study also have significant implications for &lt;strong&gt;public health strategies&lt;/strong&gt; aimed at preventing lung cancer. Just as anti-smoking campaigns have successfully reduced lung cancer rates, promoting healthier dietary habits could be a critical step in reducing the risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health initiatives could focus on educating the public about the impact of high-sugar and high-fat diets on lung cancer, encouraging healthier eating habits as part of an overall cancer prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that encouraging people to adopt healthier eating habits, particularly by reducing their intake of sugars and fats, might help lower the risk of developing LUAD. As our understanding of diet’s role in cancer progression deepens, we may see public health campaigns shift to include dietary advice as a key component in the fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get your blood pressure checked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Complete Alzheimer's UK’s Think Brain Health Check-in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would suggest that everybody does our Think Brain Health Check-in,” recommends Schott. “It’s been used by over half a million people in the UK, and you can go in and you can put in your own personal circumstances, and it’ll ask you questions about things like exercise, smoking, diet and alcohol, and will come up with some easy-to-follow advice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join Alzheimer’s Research UK this summer with the return of Walk For A Cure, a series of accessible, 5km, nationwide walking events.

This gene, carried by the likes of Avengers star Chris Hemsworth, has been linked to a ten-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with more sedentary time were more likely to experience Alzheimer’s symptoms - regardless of how much they exercised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also saw greater reduction in the size of their hippocampus, part of the brain  crucial to memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this area shrinks normally as we age, this process accelerates among those with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These results were observed despite almost nine in ten completing the 150 minutes of recommended exercise per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found the risk posed by sedentary time was particularly high for those with the APOE-e4 gene, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;APOE-e4 is carried by about one in 50 people, including the likes of Avengers star &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/chris_hemsworth/index.html" id="mol-2e9ee890-0b9a-11ef-9f23-932e8e66cb04" class=""&gt;Chris Hemsworth&lt;/a&gt;, and has been linked to a ten-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors suggested those with the APOE-e4 gene may want to take extra measures to reduce their sedentary time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Marissa Gogniat said the results demonstrated the importance of avoiding sitting for long periods, even if you are otherwise fit and active.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Minimising the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Angela Jefferson, fellow author and expert in neurology, added: 'This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among ageing adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study cannot pinpoint exactly how time spent sitting increases Alzheimer's risk, they posed a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being sedentary for long periods may disrupt the healthy flow of blood to the brain, and over the long term this could lead to structural changes in the organs that contribute to Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7million in two decades as people live longer. It marks a 40 per cent uptick on the previous forecast in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs – which include lost earnings of unpaid carers – are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is thought to because by a toxic build-up of proteins in the brain, which clump together to make it harder for the organ to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 11:14:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPQy1GREVkdWpCdFJGajlQdE9LTXVXQnNaTWNHTFc1VzJoTUFWMkpXRGtGU3RhTjB6MWJzdkFaR093ODJQTHNBUmpqZTJsZ2ZTQUhFQUFZOThyTEoxT0gzS0RWal9OajItbnFveHI4RWZqOWotQ1ZWQUlFTXdTWTdaZEoxWldGUTB4YXhCblZxa0FXRnk0d2txNm5aa3JaS3AzMFhaSmVFTC1rcmc4TmfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUEZBdnIxUWhORlpsSkhlUF90cVJCNmlqV19xQ2xvYXI0UlJvbkVka1ZVX3FFTklfOF9iVlZzdUNuZ19ITm1mUm5FVF9ZXzlFcmRBcHVpNGNkRjNJQ0lJN19ZTnJfdHVXSFdLMWFMYXlnU012RXdMSmNKdUVqMUtvSTlPVUM0dUN2V0Q1S2dqYjBMUHRCal9IM2RhdHNOT3BDTExVSUZRY1VnN251b0lEd0ZJakU</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们都不能拥有Zofran ？ - The Cut | Why Can’t We All Have Zofran? - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNNDZELTB3MFJGeUlOOGI2Vm9nRGNXUmlKdzBfZUdHd0pJMjdCdndPb2xkMGNicjVXVF9PWUdOR2VyNVFlU3RyTWFKQzItakVqQjF1cUw3MWg1ZzY4cTV0Q1Q0UEZqNFF2MFdxRVU3ZzJpN1lUSkY3TTdZSy0tWWE3QlFTLWFJQlI4Vjl3YU1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

My friend Laura says her husband keeps a stockpile for his &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/does-eating-chocolate-actually-trigger-migraine.html"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. Liz does, too, as well as Meaghan, who also uses it for vertigo. Emma used it to curtail a bout with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/being-sick-with-a-baby.html"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt; this winter, and is “guarding the remainder of the prescription like it’s solid gold.” Leah tells me, “I have the teeniest dose always on hand for my 6 ½ year old who gets carsick—we refer to it as her ‘magic pill.’” Eva says she’s been “a Zofran girlie since 2013,” popping it whenever nausea rears its queasy head. “ I used it for &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/12/morning-sickness-hyperemesis-gravidarum.html"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;,” she continues, “but I also used it recently when I was feeling slightly off and had dinner reservations at this amazing restaurant and didn’t want to throw up.” Ashley Grady, who I found deep in an Instagram comment section, says she’s used the drug near-daily for fifteen years to manage the nausea that arises from Crohn’s disease. “It’s a godsend,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0df44001c3b771x236j6k@published" data-word-count="208"&gt;It’s not surprising that people would welcome a drug that so seemingly miraculously makes the agony of nausea disappear. Often taken as a dissolving capsule placed under the tongue (it’s tough to swallow a pill when you can’t keep anything down), Zofran, the brand name for ondansetron, is both quick and effective, all but eliminating nausea in as little as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/zofran/how-long-take-zofran-work"&gt;thirty minutes&lt;/a&gt;. A&lt;a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00904"&gt;pproved by the FDA in 1991&lt;/a&gt; for use in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery, it’s changed the game for chemo-induced nausea, with one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10701260/#:~:text=Ondansetron's%20safety%20profile%20and%20well,Rao%20and%20Faso%2C%202012)."&gt;study’s&lt;/a&gt; authors calling it a “necessary medication” in a cancer patient’s arsenal. But as the aforementioned applications of the drug make clear, there are countless off-label uses, too. Zofran makes a stomach virus tolerable, reducing not only discomfort but also dehydration. The drug is a boon for those who are pregnant, hungover, or living with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352161"&gt;Yes, that’s a thing&lt;/a&gt;.) Grady tells me that because Zofran helps her live with Crohn’s, she can eschew other medications for the condition, such as “steroids and biologics and immunosuppressants.” She explains, “as long as I’m able to manage my nausea, I’m saving my kidneys, I’m saving my liver.

(If people have this condition congenitally, it may be exacerbated by Zofran). Dr. Camille Thélin, an associate professor in the University of South Florida’s division of digestive diseases and nutrition, explains that in QT prolongation, “the interval between heartbeats is longer than normal, which causes the heart to beat irregularly.” This type of arrhythmia is called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21915-torsades-de-pointes"&gt;Torsades de Pointes (TdP)&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a rapid and unpredictable heart rhythm with a mortality rate of between &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.966331/full"&gt;10 and 20 percent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these drugs also prolong the QT interval, but others impact the body’s serotonin receptors, just as Zofran does. Simultaneously taking Zofran and, say, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, or SSRI (the medication class of antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft) could result in a condition known as Serotonin Syndrome. If it’s severe enough and left untreated, it can be fatal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33196298/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s hard to say, says Thélin, because “we all have a different liver makeup based on our genetics. Some people might be fast metabolizers or slow metabolizers, and that can really change the level of serotonin in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

When you use multiple medications with the risk of prolonging the QT, it raises the hairs on the back of my neck.” Some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553159/#:~:text=Prochlorperazine%20and%20chlorpromazine%20are%20dopamine,antiemetic%20and%20migraine%20relief%20effects.&amp;amp;text=Most%20antiemetics%20used%20for%20migraines,prolongation%20and%20torsades%20de%20pointes."&gt;migraine medications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oatext.com/QT-prolongation-by-ranitidine-in-hypokalemia-and-arrhythmogen-provoked-rat-heart.php#:~:text=Currently%20there%20are%20more%20than%2050%20non%2Dcardiac,associated%20with%20case%20reports%20of%20arrhythmia%20[10]."&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are known to prolong the QT interval, as well as certain OTC drugs, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534864/#:~:text=Many%20commonly%20used%20medications%2C%20such,remains%20unknown%20with%20these%20medications."&gt;Benadryl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.okosteo.org/assets/120VAC/Presentations/Saturday/1000%20-%20Drug-Induced%20QT%20Prolongation.pdf"&gt;Pepcid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s conceivable that Zofran could help a doctor-wary sufferer retreat into denial.&lt;/p&gt;

But from there things get more complicated, and more subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

Fejzo’s research focuses on women’s health, with a particular interest in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12232-hyperemesis-gravidarum"&gt;Hyperemesis Gravidarum&lt;/a&gt; (HG), a condition during pregnancy that causes almost incessant nausea and vomiting, sometimes for the pregnancy’s full duration. I had just told her that the gastroenterologists I’d spoken with had highlighted the risks of making Zofran too accessible. She does not hold back in her disagreement. “If doctors were more willing to prescribe this drug for women to help them during pregnancy, then my answer would be different,” Fejzo says. “But it’s withheld in so many cases because of this fear of adverse outcomes. I think it would be great to have it available and let women make their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; choice about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg16001p3b77wvj5yftl@published" data-word-count="206"&gt;Fejzo&lt;a href="https://time.com/6691524/marlena-fejzo-3/"&gt; herself suffered from HG&lt;/a&gt;, so wracked by her symptoms that she was bedridden and had to receive nourishment first intravenously, then via feeding tube. Ultimately, she miscarried—an outcome that, along with preterm birth, she tells me occurs in 1 in 3 cases of HG. Fejzo says she was dismissed by her doctor, who implied that she was exaggerating her symptoms. This attitude is not uncommon among physicians, Fejzo says. “It’s rooted in historical sexism,” she continues. “I got a recording of an OBGYN, a woman doctor, teaching her medical students that when women are hospitalized with hyperemesis, it’s usually because there’s something going on at home or because they just don’t want to get better. Those were her exact words. She’s repeating this misogynistic nonsense to the next generation of medical students, and they believe her, and it just gets perpetuated.” It’s this attitude that may be what keeps Zofran out of the hands of the pregnant people who need it, Fejzo says: If a doctor doesn’t believe your symptoms are real, they’re unlikely to prescribe you a drug to cure them. Fejzo tells me she has seen cases in which wanted pregnancies were terminated because the HG symptoms were simply too much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg4u001q3b7741gz5n4u@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;Hoping to counteract the misconceptions about Zofran’s risks in pregnancy, Fejzo conducted a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151373/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. “We compared people who took Zofran who had HG to people who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take Zofran and had HG, and then we had controls who did not have HG,” she says. “The risk of adverse outcomes was increased in people with HG compared to the people who did not have it, but the risk was identical for people who had HG whether or not they took Zofran.” In other words, it’s not the drug that’s dangerous to a fetus, it’s the condition it treats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg6n001r3b77x9s60wsl@published" data-word-count="171"&gt;Fejzo believes that the tendency she’s observed for physicians to withhold Zofran from those with HG comes down to a paternalistic belief that women can’t evaluate the drug’s risks on their own and weigh them against the benefits. (This is not dissimilar to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562"&gt;demonstrated underprescribing&lt;/a&gt; of pain medication to women, who are more likely to be given sedatives than painkillers as compared to their male counterparts.) Case in point, Fejzo says, is research that found a miniscule increase in oral clefts of the fetus among pregnant subjects who took Zofran. “The increased risk is tiny. Eleven out of 10,000 people who did not take Zofran during pregnancy got an oral cleft in their fetus versus 14 out of 10,000 among those who did take it. So, there were only three more out of 10,000, which is a way lower risk than, for example, the risk of miscarrying after an amniocentesis, which is one in 200 to one in 400. Yet doctors allow women to make that choice all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg8w001s3b771rkkdbg9@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;I also spoke with Dr. Nicholas Ghionni, a Baltimore-based pulmonologist who works in the ICU. He had commented on an Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/rubin_allergy/reel/DEllts3RPnw/?hl=en"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; regarding the dangers of Zofran by Dr. Zachary Rubin, the doctor behind @rubin_allergy, an account with 1 million followers. The post explored the QT interval and Torsades de Pointes concerns, with countless people ringing alarm bells in the comments. “I take this medicine every single morning,” one person wrote. “Now I’m freaked out.” Another said, “I had no idea. I thought it was safe.” But Ghionni’s retort called for a dose of perspective. “Torsades was seen in patients who took massive doses in a chemo study (32 mg at a time),” he wrote; the standard dosage for run-of-the-mill nausea in adults is far lower, around 4 milligrams. “Furthermore,” Ghionni continued, “how does this matter if you go to your PCP and get Zofran and then go home? You’re not on continuous monitoring.” In fact, in his daily work in the ICU, Ghionni tells me, he doesn’t bother with heart monitors for a low dose of Zofran.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dga9001t3b77tsu0m0qk@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“Medicine is very dogmatic,” Ghionni says. “And all of these rules are hammered into you as an intern—one of which is ‘Zofran causes QT prolongation, be careful.’” To Ghionni, this is just an echo of how medicine has always operated: Everyone practices in the way they’ve been taught to, until “people come along and challenge the dogma and ask, okay, do we have &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; of harm or benefit?” Zofranophobe doctors might start by reading the actual &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-new-information-regarding-qt-prolongation-ondansetron-zofran"&gt;FDA warning&lt;/a&gt; attached to the drug, because Ghionni’s comment was correct about the discrepancy between the standard dose of 4 milligrams of ingested Zofran and the 32 milligram intravenous dose that was was associated with prolonged QT. Per that warning, the 32 milligram dose should be “avoided,” but there’s no risk mentioned regarding the far lower doses of Zofran that most people receive. So why, Ghionni wonders, should Zofran be, “picked out as the bad boy on the block?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dgbn001u3b77agoz8kyk@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;Which brings us to a glaring logical flaw in the prescription-only side of the Zofran debate: Ondansetron is arguably no more dangerous or prone to side effects than any number of OTC medications. Take  acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) for example, too much of which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html"&gt;a rare fatal skin reaction and liver failure&lt;/a&gt;, or cough syrups with &lt;a href="https://oxfordtreatment.com/substance-abuse/hallucinogens/dxm/"&gt;Dextromethorphan&lt;/a&gt;, which is hallucinogenic in high doses and famously prone to abuse. “I totally get why people say, yes, Zofran should be available, and others say, no, it shouldn’t be available,” says Deutsch. “I tend to argue that things like Advil and Tylenol shouldn’t be so readily available over the counter, even though they’re likely safe in most cases.” She thinks it all comes down to timing, and the way the FDA has changed its approach to regulation over the years: “It’s very, very, very infrequent that you see a new medication regulated by the FDA available over the counter anymore. If Zofran had been around 20 or 30 years earlier, it probably would’ve been OTC.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dge4001v3b77iy1b2vex@published" data-word-count="215"&gt;Deutsch also taught me an industry term: &lt;em&gt;therapeutic misadventure&lt;/em&gt;. It refers to adverse effects  stemming from the attempt to address a medical problem—and, in this context, to the ways in which the average person consumes medications they don’t realize are dangerous. “You’re trying to treat your pain or nausea,” Deutsch says, offering a hypothetical. “You take one pill, and it helps a little but you’re still in discomfort, so you think,&lt;em&gt; wouldn’t a second pill help more?&lt;/em&gt; It makes perfect sense, except that with medications, more is not necessarily better.” It’s easier to make OTC medication mistakes than you may realize, and every year, roughly &lt;a href="https://ph.health.mil/topics/healthyliving/asm/Pages/OverCounter.aspx"&gt;178,000 people&lt;/a&gt; wind up in the hospital for this reason. A Zofran misadventure doesn’t seem outside the realm of possibility; if you’re nauseous, you’re distracted. Did you take the last dose two hours ago, or three? You took it in tablet form, then threw up—do you take it again? You skipped a dose because you felt okay, but now you’re queasy. If the directive on the package is to take no more than 24 mg per day, and you’d still be below that threshold, can you take two? The point is, it’s easy to get lost in the nuances, and hidden in all that medicine minutiae are opportunities for mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

No, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it kept from patients because of sexism, or inflated fears, or dogmatic thinking, or because it was created thirty years too late? It’s hard to say. But the case for OTC ondansetron is compelling. Prolonged QT intervals are rare, as is Serotonin Syndrome. The FDA could require, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/legal-requirements-sale-and-purchase-drug-products-containing-pseudoephedrine-ephedrine-and"&gt;as it does for cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine&lt;/a&gt; (a key ingredient in methamphetamine), that Zofran only be sold in limited doses to those able to present a government ID. And anyway, as Fejzo points out, even in hospital settings there’s often not as much attention paid to arrhythmia-related concerns as you might think. “Even when Zofran is prescribed,” Fejzo says, echoing Ghionni, “are people on it being monitored? Are they checking their hearts? No, I doubt it.” A Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hvfwam/if_the_concern_for_ordering_zofran_is_prolonged/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from late last year in r/nursing suggests not: “When I worked med/surg, we gave [Zofran] to almost everyone who needed antiemetics and we didn’t need the patients on tele or EKG to do so”—meaning nurses were not asked to monitor patients’ heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

Happily, he agreed. However, going the artificial insemination route is expensive, so we are going to use the turkey baster method. When I told my sister, she was aghast and said it was a terrible idea. Even worse, she told our mother (without my consent), who in turn told my aunts, cousins, and grandmother, and now they’re all up in arms! How do I put this fire out?&lt;/p&gt;

You just allow them to be up in arms. If they share their feelings with you, you can respond, “Well, that’s what we’ve decided to do, and luckily, we’re the only ones whose feelings matter.” It’s also worth letting people know that you are paying attention to their reactions and will be taking them into consideration when deciding who to include when the time comes for updates about the pregnancy and baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwl001o3b76gieyq8tp@published"&gt;Our daughter-in-law, “Alyssa,” has been a widow for four years. I adore her; she and our son, “Brian,” were so in love. But I don’t know how to bring up an awkward topic: dating again. Brian was diagnosed with aggressive leukemia at 27 and never got to turn 28. They’d always wanted kids, especially Allie. Sadly, Allie had a late miscarriage after his diagnosis. It was a horrible time for everyone, but Allie was consumed by the combined grief. We invited her to stay with us after his death because we loved her, and I was frankly worried about her well-being. She was working and seeing friends, but it was like she was sleepwalking through it all, and her physical health was visibly bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalh2fpk00293b76juhwhmci@published"&gt;Alyssa slowly recovered and took the initiative to move into her own place two years ago. She seems well, and we still see her often, but she doesn’t seem to be dating, even casually. Last year, I gently suggested getting out there, and she sharply told me it was way too soon. But if she wants a baby, the time window to meet someone isn’t that long. I want her to have the family she talks about, and I know her own dad is pushing the “too soon” narrative at her. Her parents were worse than useless in her early widowhood: They got a divorce a few weeks before Brian’s death and then tried to get family to pick sides after his funeral. How can I gently suggest she consider dating anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001r3b76em2321sl@published"&gt;I can tell how much you care about Alyssa and sincerely want the best for her. I think it’s great that you’ve continued to nurture your relationship and want her to find love, even though I imagine seeing her with a new partner might bring up some complicated feelings about Brian. She’s lucky to have you in her life, cheering for her to rebuild and find happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001s3b76uyjasc2k@published"&gt;But you need to take a big step back. When it comes to shaping Alyssa’s future, your role is to be a loving mother-in-law who can connect with her about a major source of grief. That’s it. You shouldn’t be a matchmaker or a fertility awareness counselor. And you definitely, definitely want to avoid becoming a source of stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwo001t3b76jnh0s5n7@published"&gt;Also, believe me, there is no way this woman is unaware of the typical age range in which people have biological children. She has friends and internet access. She knows. She may very well miss the window for that specific kind of motherhood, because she’s just not ready to get back out there and find a partner in time. If that happens, it won’t be a tragedy. In fact, it will actually be much better than forcing herself to date while she’s still in mourning, having a child, and then experiencing yet another devastating loss when the relationship doesn’t work out because she wasn’t over your son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003h3b76gkt5t1wm@published"&gt;I have been divorced for three years, and I have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. My ex and I share equal custody, and I never thought she would play games like this using our kids. I have only been dating casually until I met “Emily.” We are talking about marriage, and after I informed my ex, she changed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="223" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003i3b76klrpj50h@published"&gt;Now she can’t bear not hearing from our kids every single night I have them. She has to video chat with them for up to an hour every night and uses guilt tactics against our kids. I essentially feel like she has invaded my home, especially with Emily over. We have no privacy, and my ex tells the kids to show her the house when she calls. It is the same one I have owned since the divorce. If I take away their devices and tell my kids they will see their mom in a few days, they get hysterical. My 7-year-old has more meltdowns than they did as a toddler. This has only started since I told my ex about Emily, so it is obvious that she feels threatened and needs to get her claws in. We already had a big issue with her trying to change the custody drop-off from my work to my home, despite it being far away from her own (my work is equally distant from both houses). My ex denies everything, and I can’t afford to take her back to court. I love Emily and my kids. I am ready to start a new chapter in our lives. Emily and the kids got along great until now. I don’t want this issue to screw that up. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfh003l3b76rpjxa69a@published"&gt;This is tough because while you know your ex is using the nightly calls to insert herself into your new life, to put an end to them would upset and maybe even hurt your kids. You could end up—fairly or not—looking like the bad guy. In conflicts like this one, between divorced parents, I always think it’s important to keep your eye on the prize: your children’s well-being, and how you’ll look when they think back on the situation when they’re 30. The goal is for their therapists to one day say, “It sounds like your dad was a really safe person for you and put your needs first.” Sometimes, that means letting your ex win, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfi003m3b76wvnui0h0@published"&gt;But I also understand how unsettled you are by her thinly-veiled protest against the new relationship. So you should beat her at her own game. Everyone can gather around the iPad and call her together—yes, Emily too! You could start suggesting virtual game nights and remote dance parties. You might even volunteer to initiate the calls: “Hey, Em and the kids and I are making pancakes. Would you like me to FaceTime so you can see the process?” Your kids will get the contact they want with their mom and the very important feeling that the adults in their lives are kind to each other. You’ll totally avoid being the villain. You’ll take the mystery out of Emily’s presence. And eventually, I guarantee, your ex will get bored or see that she’s not getting under your skin the way she hoped she would, and her FaceTime fixation will slowly fade &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                A new study says millions of children in the U.S. live in a household with a parent who has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2833575" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And a significant number of those children have a parent whose addiction is moderate or severe as opposed to mild, the study finds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The number amounts to 1 in 4 children with a parent who has addiction.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm an addiction doc, and so I think about this issue all the time," says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/22683/scott-hadland" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Hadland&lt;/a&gt;, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study. "Even still, I was surprised at how high that percentage was. It's just an enormous number of kids that are affected."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If one-quarter of kids in the U.S. have a parent with a substance use disorder, that tells us that every day in our clinics we are encountering many, if not dozens of families that are affected by substance use disorders," he adds. "And we need to be poised and ready to help support those families."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, a federal survey that estimated the prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders based on the most updated criteria in the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V&lt;/em&gt; (DSM-5). The national survey is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but the team in charge of the survey &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2474698-us-government-fired-researchers-running-a-crucial-drug-use-survey/" target="_blank"&gt;was let go&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recent reduction in force. It is unclear how the cuts will affect the future of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study's main finding is significantly higher than previous estimates (&lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/faa1b19e66053008e89782914f0aa693/children-at-risk-of-sud.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7 million in a 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;), which had relied on diagnostic criteria from the DSM-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new study also estimated how many children have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction as opposed to mild.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We also found that 7.6 million children live in a household with a parent that has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder," says study author &lt;a href="https://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/sean-esteban-mccabe" target="_blank"&gt;Sean Esteban McCabe&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan. "And 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McCabe and his team also found that more than 6 million children have a parent with a mental health condition in addition to a substance use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"These estimates are incredibly important to understand the scope of parental substance use disorder in the United States," wrote &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/doctors/20360/davida-schiff" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Davida Schiff&lt;/a&gt; in an email. Schiff is a pediatrician and addiction medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another notable finding in the study, according to Schiff, is that a majority of the parents — 12 million — had alcohol use disorder. "While alcohol is more socially acceptable in our society, the study points to a need to pay greater attention to a rising number of children exposed to parental alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's also important to remember that alcohol is actually the leading cause of substance-related deaths in the United States," notes Hadland. "It actually kills more people in the U.S. than do opioids every year, but it's a slower death rate. It's a chronic disease process that affects, you know, somebody's liver, somebody's risk of developing cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And children of parents with addiction are themselves at a higher risk of various physical and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Young children growing up in homes affected by parental SUD (substance use disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing impaired caregiving, disruption of parental abilities, unintentional ingestions, and witnessing parental overdose," wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They are also at a higher risk of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;developing certain &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/08/nx-s1-5389885/medicaid-payments-barely-keep-hospital-mental-health-units-afloat-federal-cuts-could-sink-them" target="_blank"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and substance use problems in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One thing that I'm doing as a pediatrician is when I'm caring for a young person who has a parent with a substance use disorder, is making sure that I'm doing a good job asking about and screening for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, ADHD, all of which we know can be more common in kids of parents with addiction," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/2/e20161575/52464/Families-Affected-by-Parental-Substance-Use?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;ask patients&lt;/a&gt; and/or parents about substance use in the family in order to educate them about the risks of substance use and connect families to treatment when needed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We as pediatricians and family medicine doctors might think about screening parents for substance use and substance use disorders when they come into our clinics to help make sure that we can identify problems and get parents connected to treatment, because that's probably in the best interest of their child," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatric clinics affiliated with Mass General Brigham in the Boston area use a developmental screening that &lt;a href="https://www.teamupforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SWYC-2-Month-English-Age-specific-2021.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;includes questions about parental substance use&lt;/a&gt;, wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents with addiction love their children and want the best for them, she says, but may not access treatment because of stigma about seeking help for addiction and barriers to accessing care.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For parents with substance use disorder, Schiff says, she and her colleagues "discuss safe storage of substances, identification of a safe and sober caregiver for children during periods of active use, and provide training in naloxone administration should an unintentional ingestion occur."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for parents with addiction who have infants, she recommends avoiding breastfeeding after using substances and discusses safe sleep practices "to prevent unsafe sleep injuries and infant suffocation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that over three-fourths of people with substance use disorders do not get treatment," says McCabe. "And kids who are in households with parents that don't get help are much less likely to get help themselves. So I just think it's important for us who serve and provide care to children to understand what these numbers mean and also how we can design programs to meet these kids where they're at."&lt;/p&gt;

Among her regular meal rotations are egg whites, protein shakes, beef sticks and several large servings of meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On social media, Dr. Wright encourages middle-aged women to eat a lot of protein, often recommending that they consume up to one gram of protein per pound of “ideal” body weight, or the weight they aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That’s far more protein than &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html" title=""&gt;federal guidelines and most nutrition experts recommend&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview with The Times, Dr. Wright said that this amount can help keep women strong, and prevent issues like hip fractures as they age. Is she right?

They often gain weight, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/move/belly-fat-women.html" title=""&gt;particularly in the midsection&lt;/a&gt;, for example; and that’s linked with certain health risks, such as for cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, Dr. Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At the same time, women usually lose bone and muscle, increasing their risk for osteoporosis, fractures and frailty, Dr. Burns said. Consuming enough protein, especially when paired with strength training, may help stave off those changes, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

They’re sugar-free but come in summery dessert flavors like Sherbet Swirl. On social media, the drinks are brandished by members of an official &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/alaninuambassadors/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collegiate ambassadors program&lt;/a&gt;, gymnasts and cheerleaders whose dewy complexions suggest they’ve never had a hangover or slept through their alarm after a late-night study session. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alani Nu, which was founded in 2018 by fitness influencer and coach Katy Hearn and acquired by competitor Celsius for $1.8 billion this spring, has styled itself as the nectar that fuels today’s effortlessly high-achieving, hummingbird-like young woman. (You can imagine Margot Robbie cracking open a can in the “Barbie” movie, just before her character experiences an existential breakdown.) Its success shows how the &lt;a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/energy-drink-production/4205/#TopQuestionsAnswered" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$22 billion energy drink&lt;/a&gt; industry, long dominated by labels like Monster and Red Bull that use extreme sports swagger to appeal to young men, is tapping into the aesthetics of health and wellness to reach new demographics and continue its exponential growth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the newer breeds tout “better for you ingredients” and benefits, from biotin (“oh, that hair skin + nails,” promises the copy on &lt;a href="https://getgorgie.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gorgie&lt;/a&gt;) to lion’s mane mushrooms (“boosts memory, focus, and mental clarity,” declares the vaguely intellectual &lt;a href="https://odysseyelixir.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;). One hedge fund &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/09/monster-stock-drop-short-seller-report-wellness-drinks-steph-curry-dwayne-rock-michelle-obama-plezi-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently said it was betting against&lt;/a&gt; the $55 billion Monster empire, predicting it would be edged out by brands that appear more health-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem, health experts say, is the new wellness-themed marketing may be worsening consumer confusion over the risks of energy drinks. Many energy drinks contain supercharged doses of caffeine that are particularly risky for children, teenagers, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with underlying heart conditions. More surprising may be their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;potential dangers&lt;/a&gt; when working out, particularly since energy drinks are often promoted by fitness influencers and athletes. Researchers also worry the health risks may be compounded when combined with other common energy-drink ingredients like the amino acid taurine and guarana, a plant seed that contains caffeine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing kids who show up with tachycardia,” or rapid heartbeat, said Mark Corkins, the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. “Some of them have chest pain and you find out they drink three or four energy drinks a day.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just adolescents, Corkins said, but preteens too. He tells parents and kids the same thing: Energy drinks are not benign, nor are they a substitute for sleep. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People just don’t have any idea of what they’re getting,” said Victoria Vetter, a pediatric cardiologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who co-authored a recent &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; on energy drinks’ risks to young people. She recalls evaluating a 7-year-old patient for an abnormal heart rhythm and asking if he drank any caffeine. Sure enough, his parents had bought him YouTube influencer &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/13/prime-energy-drink-logan-paul-chuck-schumer/"&gt;Logan Paul’s Prime Energy&lt;/a&gt;, which contains 200 milligrams of caffeine, after he saw a video game influencer drinking it and asked for one. (The brand also has a caffeine-free drink, Prime Hydration, with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ewCKA2TXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;similar packaging&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a bottle rather than a can — which critics say creates more potential confusion.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Beverage Association, which represents 94% of the U.S. energy drink market, said in a statement that for more than a decade, its members “have gone beyond all federal requirements when it comes to responsible labeling and marketing practices by displaying total caffeine content from all sources on labels and adhering to a long-standing commitment to not market to children.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under age 12 avoid caffeine entirely, and that adolescents between 12-18 have no more than 100 mg per day. But an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-nutrition/energy-drinks/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/energy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;30%-50% of adolescents&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. still consume energy drinks, many of which &lt;a href="https://www.cspinet.org/caffeine-chart#energy_drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;contain&lt;/a&gt; between 160-300 mg of caffeine per can. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-nutrition/energy-drinks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high schools&lt;/a&gt; even make them available in &lt;a href="https://www.kctv5.com/video/2025/04/24/goddard-parents-weigh-allowing-energy-drinks-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hhsbroadcaster.com/15658/op-ed/opinion-energy-drinks-should-be-removed-from-the-cafeteria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cafeterias&lt;/a&gt;. Making them all the more risky is that many “are marketed in a way that makes them appear not to be energy drinks — not to be highly caffeinated products that could potentially be dangerous,” said Frances Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has linked energy drinks to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5714807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; like arrhythmias and, in rare but potentially fatal cases, &lt;a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00189-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;, along with a wide range of health problems like seizures, stomach problems, poor sleep, and higher levels of stress and anxiety. That said, it can be difficult to tell whether energy drinks are a direct cause of such health problems or merely correlated with them. The most recent data from America’s Poison Centers shows an uptick in calls about exposure to energy drinks in children and teens up to age 19, with 2,609 calls in 2024.   &lt;/p&gt;



		
		



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-drinks-the-24-7-beverage"&gt;Energy drinks, the 24/7 beverage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health risks of energy drinks were a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2013/7/energy-drinks-exploring-concerns-about-marketing-to-youth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hot topic&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. about a decade ago. Since then, the market has only grown. As of 2025, there were &lt;a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/energy-drink-production/4205/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;254 energy drink businesses&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., compared to just 49 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve learned over the years is that energy is a need state” for which there’s round-the-clock demand, said Michael Bellas, head of the research and consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corporation. Other than water, he said, energy is the No. 1 fuel that today’s anxious, hassled consumer relies upon: “You can do it 24/7.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaning into that broad appeal, energy drinks are increasingly blending into the broader functional beverage market alongside &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/healthy-sodas-like-poppi-olipop-are-drawing-pepsi-and-coca-cola-s-attention?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTU4ODQ5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2MTkzMjk1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVjlRSDVEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI4RENBNTA1MjBBM0I0QUExQUM3NEQ4M0JERDFFOTI4OSJ9.G_15-_PwoZxqBIllo3SC3LeiNTE0L1ALbaxPoxowvhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;probiotic sodas&lt;/a&gt;, hydrating sports drinks, and adaptogenic elixirs containing ingredients like hemp or ashwagandha meant to help with mood and stress. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $9 billion Celsius strategically &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PS0vwsMCOiA?si=0Opv3dkpxoaTkSZJ&amp;amp;t=860" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;built its brand&lt;/a&gt; within the health and beauty category in grocery stores, “next to the Atkins and the protein bars,” as CEO John Fieldly said in a recent interview, and then became affiliated with the &lt;a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/celsius-is-luring-consumers-that-dont-want-grandfathers-energy-drink-c/607026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wellness movement&lt;/a&gt; during Covid. Now the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S. after Monster and Red Bull, a 12-ounce can of Celsius contains 200 mg of caffeine per can — half of the maximum daily amount considered safe for adults. (Twelve ounces of coffee contains anywhere from 113 mg to 247 mg of caffeine, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;.) Though it’s labeled as an energy drink, some find it &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_n3ZTTuyqQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=b5c605a1-5c1d-4632-80e2-dd74e07901b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to mentally miscategorize: It’s often shelved alongside sparkling and flavored waters in grocery stores, featuring a “Live Fit” motto and minimalist packaging with pictures of berries or passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High school and college-age women are drawn to Celsius because it’s low-calorie, experts say, and &lt;a href="https://www.celsius.com/the-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;claims to help speed up metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. The Wall Street Journal &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/young-women-with-eating-disorders-are-overdoing-it-with-energy-drinks-e82981e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the drinks are popular among young women with eating disorders, who may be more susceptible to adverse effects from too much caffeine. Celsius also markets itself as a pre- or post-workout drink, holding &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHZQ06pTo6M/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;influencer events&lt;/a&gt; at the Pilates-inspired gym Solidcore — which also &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/solidcore-launches-new-membership-benefit-program-core-collective-302037177.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sells cans in studios&lt;/a&gt; at a discount to members. “That’s something that is really not recommended to do at any age, is to consume these products and exert yourself and exercise,” said Fleming-Milici. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The American College of Sports Medicine &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Fulltext/2018/02000/Energy_Drinks___A_Contemporary_Issues_Paper.9.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that energy drinks be avoided before, during, and after strenuous activities, noting that some deaths allegedly linked to energy drinks happened under those circumstances. In the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14530577/energy-drinks-death-heart-attack-superfit-gym-caffeine.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Katie Donnell&lt;/a&gt;, a teacher who habitually drank three energy drinks a day as part of her workout routine, died after a heart attack at age 28. Eighteen-year-old mixed martial arts athlete &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/tragic-death-of-young-athlete-during-mma-training-raises-concerns-over-energy-drink-safety/ar-AA1plhQ6?apiversion=v2&amp;amp;noservercache=1&amp;amp;domshim=1&amp;amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;amp;wcseo=1&amp;amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;amp;noservertelemetry=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Zach Doran&lt;/a&gt;, who had a fatal heart attack, reportedly consumed energy drinks regularly. It’s not known whether or to what extent the energy drinks played a role in their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other energy drinks are leaning less into wellness and more into partnerships with brands and flavors associated with childhood innocence. &lt;a href="https://drinkghost.com/collections/energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cellucor.com/collections/c4-energy-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;C4&lt;/a&gt; have energy drinks in varieties like Welch’s Grape, Sour Patch Kids, and Popsicle. If it sounds like those might appeal to young kids, there are several &lt;a href="https://truthinadvertising.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/12_12_22-Ghost-complaint-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;regulatory complaints&lt;/a&gt; and a recently dismissed &lt;a href="https://blog.priceplow.com/wp-content/uploads/barrales-v-ghost-mondelez-2024-02-12-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that make exactly that argument.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her research on energy drink consumption among teens and children, Teesside University public health nutrition professor Amelia Lake found that parents were using energy drinks as breakfast substitutes. “The word energy is really positive — it’s going to give you energy and improve concentration,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, Lake &lt;a href="https://fuse.ac.uk/research/impactonpublichealthpracticepolicy/energydrinksandyoungpeopleshealth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;campaigned&lt;/a&gt; with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to curb sales of the product to young people in the U.K., prompting a number of grocery store chains to voluntarily instate age requirements. Energy drinks “remain the fastest-growing sector within the soft drink market,” said Lake, who is also the deputy director of Fuse, an inter-university center for translational research in public health. “They are highly profitable, and their manufacturers will say they are not marketing to children or young people. But when they are associated with everything that is part of youth culture — music, extreme sport — they can’t help being part of youth culture.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-health-risks-of-energy-drinks"&gt;The health risks of energy drinks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most serious risks of energy drinks involve their impact on the heart, said Vetter, the pediatric cardiologist. “They increase heart rate, do all of these abnormal things — it can increase the likelihood of having a coronary event, a blockage of the artery, or a perforation of the artery,” she said. “Anybody who is more susceptible to these things is going to be more significantly affected, but a lot of people don’t know they’re at risk” — particularly young people who haven’t lived long enough for an underlying heart condition to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Mayo Clinic study published last year found that &lt;a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00189-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;seven out of 144&lt;/a&gt; survivors of sudden cardiac arrest had consumed an energy drink within 12 hours of the event. Four of the survivors had heart rhythm disorders, while three had no clear underlying cause. That’s a small sample size, and the authors note that energy drinks may be just one of several factors contributing to the “perfect storm” of circumstances that led to the sudden cardiac arrest. But they found sufficient evidence to say that energy drinks could be triggering for people with underlying heart disorders, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to provide guidelines about energy drink consumption and risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coffee, of course, also contains caffeine —  but it’s less trendy among young people, less concentrated, and less likely to be downed quickly as a pre- or post-workout beverage. And it’s not just the caffeine that’s a potential risk for people with underlying conditions. “The energy drinks have a lot of other substances in them,” Vetter explained, the effects of which are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond heart issues, health experts have also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10535526/#sec5-nutrients-15-03922" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sounded alarms about links&lt;/a&gt; between energy drinks and seizures, gastrointestinal problems, dental issues (varieties like Monster often contain as much sugar as soda), and worse mental health — potentially because of all that tossing and turning that over-caffeinated people tend to do instead of sleep. Studies have linked energy drink consumption among young people with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, you feel good immediately and then there’s a big crash,” said Vetter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-drink-bans-and-caffeine-labeling-proposals"&gt;Energy drink bans and caffeine labeling proposals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the potential harms for people whose bodies are still developing, countries in Europe are increasingly cracking down on sales of energy drinks to minors. Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-03/why-this-region-in-spain-thinks-energy-drinks-are-bad-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Galicia region of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and Sweden have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350623003189" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;age requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11960718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/05-02-2025-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-minors-banned-in-kazakhstan-in-bold-public-health-move" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; have followed suit. The U.K. Labor party &lt;a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/build-an-nhs-fit-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to ban energy drinks for children under 16 if elected to power (they won, though no law has been announced yet), and &lt;a href="https://www.praguedaily.news/2024/11/14/czech-government-plans-to-ban-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-children-under-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Czech lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; are moving forward with a similar ban.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the U.S., the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2511/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act&lt;/a&gt;, a House bill introduced by Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) in March, would introduce some restrictions. Named after Katz, a 21-year-old college student who died from cardiac arrest in 2023 after drinking Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, the bill would introduce new requirements, such as a “high caffeine” notice on restaurant menus for beverages with more than 150 mg, and require government agencies to further study the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks, as well as energy drinks’ marketing tactics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the Make America Healthy Again movement calling attention to the health impacts of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/09/snap-soda-ban-maha-movement-health-nutrition-runs-into-political-headwinds/"&gt;sugary drinks like soda&lt;/a&gt; and the concern that many people feel over the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/22/food-companies-agree-to-phase-out-synthetic-dyes-handing-maha-a-victory/"&gt;safety of food ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, Menendez is &lt;a href="https://jcitytimes.com/rep-menendez-pushes-for-caffeine-labeling-law-after-death-of-jersey-city-college-student/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt; about the bill’s chances. But for now, the U.S. has comparatively few regulations in place: Previous &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/13/prime-energy-drink-logan-paul-chuck-schumer/"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-xpm-2013-aug-31-la-na-energy-drinks-20130901-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state officials&lt;/a&gt; yielded only a &lt;a href="https://www.energydrinkinformation.com/responsible-labeling-and-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;voluntary commitment&lt;/a&gt; from manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no minimum age for purchases of energy drinks in the U.S., some are &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; as dietary supplements rather than as soft drinks — meaning they can bypass the &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA’s limit&lt;/a&gt; of 71 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces of carbonated soda. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figuring out exactly how much caffeine an energy drink contains requires some detective work, and often a pair of reading glasses. Companies can place information about a drink’s amount of caffeine anywhere on the packaging — often in tiny type and consistently without context about the recommended daily limit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alina Yang, a high school junior in New York’s Westchester County, said drinks like Celsius and Red Bull are a common accessory among her classmates. But her family has a history of heart disease, and as the founder of Guardians of the Heart, a nonprofit focused on educating young people about cardiovascular disease prevention, she tries to let her peers know that energy drinks can be a problem. The trouble is, she said, “adolescents don’t do anything until something bad happens to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a March 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(25)00091-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; for The Journal of Pediatrics, Yang described how influencers on TikTok and elsewhere can make energy drinks seem like not just a habit but a symbol of achievement. The medical students she watches for career inspiration on social media often guzzle the beverages while preparing for exams. The videos, which are sometimes sponsored by energy drink brands, are bound to make people like her wonder: “&lt;em&gt;Oh, if that’s the path I want to go, are those the habits I have to have and the decisions I’d have to make&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of logic that health experts worry could turn young people into lifelong energy drink customers. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Once we start dietary behaviors,” Lake said, “it’s really hard to change.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The result is often a longer, more intense period of symptoms,” said Dr. Frederic Little, a pulmonologist and allergist at Boston Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Whether it was just allergies or a combination, I felt miserable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dry and windy days trigger the worst allergies, yet &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/07/metro/dave-epstein-new-england-weekend-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/07/metro/dave-epstein-new-england-weekend-forecast/"&gt;last week’s rainy weather&lt;/a&gt; and the recent &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/11/metro/boston-new-england-rainy-weather/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/11/metro/boston-new-england-rainy-weather/"&gt;wet weekends&lt;/a&gt;, though a nuisance for many, were a blessing for allergy sufferers by helping suppress the burgeoning pollen season. You might be wondering, then, if this season is relatively tame, why am I and others still suffering? That is a great question, and the answer lies in a longer allergy season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Allergies have been starting weeks before the blooms begin here in New England. You might even start coughing and sneezing before the snow melts for the season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What’s been validated &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013284118" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;in scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is that both the duration and intensity of pollen seasons have increased in temperate zones like where we live… climate change has shifted the baseline,” said Little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2013284118" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;One study that examined 60 locations&lt;/a&gt; across North America found pollen seasons expanded by an average of 20 days from 1990 to 2018, and pollen concentrations increased by 21 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The USA National Phenology Network’s &lt;a href="https://www.usanpn.org/data/maps/spring" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Spring Leaf Index Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; indicates that leaves have emerged about two weeks ahead of schedule in the Northeast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Then, as high pressure and sinking air move in, those pollen particles find their way back down to the surface. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to meteorologist Shel Winkley, the growing season has increased significantly across the Carolinas, which in turn kicks off pollen season even earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Raleigh’s growing season has increased by 38 days. Charlotte, Asheville, Greenville, all are seeing a month or more of extra plant growth time per year,” said Winkley. A longer season in the Carolinas translates into an earlier season here in New England.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some experts believe there is another piece to the equation that’s worsening your symptoms: &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that an increase in human-caused CO2 emissions is cranking out tree pollen grains &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7"&gt;in greater numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“(Carbon dioxide) is plant food. It doesn’t just warm the planet — it supercharges plants to grow more and produce more pollen, making allergy seasons not only longer but more intense,” Winkley said. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have now surpassed 425 parts per million, which is the highest concentration in human history and a clear marker of accelerating climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="new_england's_triggering_pollens" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom

He gathered his family, helped older neighbors to their cars and fled without a single keepsake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the days that followed, Dr. Elsayegh, a pulmonologist, did not have a chance to grieve. As he did his rounds with patients at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., his cellphone was bombarded with neighbors and friends seeking his expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;What kind of air purifier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;Is an N-95 mask enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;My daughter has asthma — should we rent a place farther away?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Forty phone calls a day with the same set of questions,” Dr. Elsayegh recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So when the chief administrative officer of the hospital invited him into his office to ask Dr. Elsayegh how he could support him and his family, Dr. Elsayegh replied instead, “Let’s open a clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Just three weeks after the blaze tore through neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the hospital’s urban fire clinic for pulmonary issues began seeing patients. They came in droves, each with a different set of symptoms and concerns. The clinic has served as an early indicator of the types of health problems developing among those exposed to the fires, ranging from newfound shortness of breath in healthy people to exacerbated symptoms in patients with asthma, C.O.P.D. and other lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The health effects of an urban fire differ from a those of a wildfire, and when an entire community burns quickly, releasing unquantifiable toxins in unexpected directions for an unknowable period of time, there are long-term health effects that no expert can yet fully calculate. Dr. Elsayegh is making it his mission to support patients from the Palisades and surrounding communities for months and years into the future, when, he fears, cleanup crew members and others with chronic exposure may begin to show signs of severe lung diseases, like asbestosis and silicosis, and even cancers like mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

In the body, these nutrients from foods go on to aid cells, organs and body systems, carrying out chemical and physical functions essential for health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers and scientists have studied the effect of certain foods on our brains and a “reduced risk of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/alzheimers-disease" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and a slower rate of cognitive decline” has been noted when certain diets are followed. However, other foods commonly eaten were “associated with a higher risk of developing dementia and worse cognition”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK reports that “almost half (45%) of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/dementia" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed”. The charity linked such cases to “factors that affect our health throughout our life” with diet playing an important part along with other lifestyle choices and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red meat, processed meats and saturated fat can increase the risk of dementia, heart disease and diabetes, reports Alzheimer’s Research UK. The organisation explained that “foods like sausages and other processed meats, butter, cheese and cakes can be high in saturated fat” which can lead to many health issues - and these other diseases can up your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/reducing-your-risk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;report from Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt; stated: “What’s good for your heart is good for your brain. That’s because the brain relies on a good blood supply to stay healthy. Taking steps to look after our heart can help lower our risk of cardiovascular diseases, and our risk of dementia too.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK added that “eating too much saturated fat and sugar” can also “increase the risk” of dementia. The charity advises eating a healthy balanced diet, keeping your BMI at a healthy level and keeping as active as possible day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging (NIA) also reported on foods and brain health, explaining that it’s possible that “eating a certain diet affects biological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that underlie Alzheimer’s”. NIA explained the possible link between a person’s diet indirectly “affecting other Alzheimer’s risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NIA reports &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;on the topic&lt;/a&gt;: “For example, the typical Western diet increases cardiovascular disease risk, possibly contributing to faster brain aging. A growing area of research focuses on the relationship between gut microbes - tiny organisms in the digestive system - and aging-related processes that lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The important role of physical activity and exercise, and how this interacts with diet, cardiovascular health, and brain health must also be considered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NIA added&lt;/a&gt;: “Many foods - blueberries, leafy greens, and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric), to name a few - have been studied for their potential cognitive benefit. These foods have been thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or other properties that might help protect the brain. However, so far, there is no evidence that eating or avoiding a specific food can prevent Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Still, scientists continue to look for clues. A recent study showed that a molecule in green tea breaks apart tangles of the protein tau, which builds up in the brain due to Alzheimer’s. Based on this finding, the team identified other potential Alzheimer’s drug candidates. Another study, based on older adults’ reports of their eating habits, found that eating a daily serving of leafy green vegetables such as spinach or kale was associated with slower age-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to the neuroprotective effects of certain nutrients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Research has also shown that a diet that includes regular fish consumption is associated with higher cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with age.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK also pointed out several other factors that could help lower your risk of dementia such as looking after your hearing and sight, drinking less alcohol, being physically active and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other environmental factors including air pollution, quality of early years education, social deprivation and social isolation could all lead to a higher risk of the disease, Alzheimer’s Research UK reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "We have more control over some of these factors than others. For example, we often can’t change how much air pollution we are exposed to. But we can do more physical activity and watch what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPRUxFUVk0NHVmXzZTR0xZRXFfemNOUXBxdUhCbG5WbUZUTEVOZjQ3QlhvbUNteEh1aEVGRTg2VnBveVlpQXNzdjJlTVVQZ3p5QTNsN0tVRVlWN3c1VDBaR2x1MHVNRXNtU0pZN2x3Ti1qbU1jck1fdG1yVi1Nd3RkWnpB0gGHAUFVX3lxTE1BVE1rdlgxUVh0bVIteTlGLTM3RDBIR1RxenJGd3VVYjRCYk9fVnNVc09UaDRIWDNCcGFwRU4yV01nTGtiZFZoaGZuMDE5ZjNodWVrZUpPa1U5MkZNU3F1VU1pR0p6cmpfMVFadnI2cVctMF80b01EWm85T25VYk9BWTctOWlEUQ</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜焦虑的增加：我们是否过度使用防晒霜？ - Refinery29 | The Rise Of Sunscreen Anxiety: Are We Taking SPF Too Far? - Refinery29</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5LYmo3LS1Lcm9MWW1yZjE3R0Z0d2ltVDdqZzIyVlBXVmxGal94bjN0QWpZUnJtQ2xoQjI3bks4NWdCcXEtMWZoWTZZSjJHNmg4UXFPVDhiSUlzTlN0LWtiVl9hbUFsMThMb29odjNjMV83dWNCdUtTQnFwZnlPU28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="section-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go to the beach, you should reapply sun protection every two hours,” adds Dr Phillips, and if you’re entering the water, it may get washed off, so you need to apply it again once you’re out.” The rules are the same regardless of your &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin"&gt;skin tone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, says Dr Phillips. But what about when it isn’t as sunny? Suppose you’re heading to work at 8 a.m. when it's relatively dark outside, and coming home in the evening well after the sun has set. Is sunscreen necessary then? “When the UV index is low in early mornings, you don’t need to use [sunscreen] as much,” Dr Phillips explains, especially if you’re wearing more clothes. Dr Phillips recommends focusing on exposed areas, applying a teaspoon-sized amount of SPF to your face and neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Refinery29</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5LYmo3LS1Lcm9MWW1yZjE3R0Z0d2ltVDdqZzIyVlBXVmxGal94bjN0QWpZUnJtQ2xoQjI3bks4NWdCcXEtMWZoWTZZSjJHNmg4UXFPVDhiSUlzTlN0LWtiVl9hbUFsMThMb29odjNjMV83dWNCdUtTQnFwZnlPU28</guid></item><item><title>我正在用11美元的咖啡因眼霜治疗我的黑眼圈，让粉丝看起来清醒- instyle.com | I’m Treating My Dark Circles With an $11 Caffeine Eye Cream That Makes Fans Look Awake - instyle.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5mWVRtMnFyNEhpQktBckN0MGhLZVg1WFhpNGZ4aDBRWkQwR01vdzdUSzdMbFVnemExa2l6QUtUM1hXOEk2alJYZmZnY0lvWG1ONS1uRkl3ZGk3QURXbTZxM2hhc3J4azU2UVdDamk2Vmp6Y2ppMTZjUA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As someone &lt;a href="https://www.instyle.com/how-to-shade-match-foundation-5383450" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;with fair skin&lt;/a&gt; and night-owl habits, I can always count on my dark circles to make an appearance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like its name suggests, the under-eye treatment is made with &lt;a href="https://www.instyle.com/best-eye-creams-for-puffiness-8584508" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hero ingredient caffeine&lt;/a&gt; to reduce puffiness and firm your skin. Plus, it contains squalane and &lt;a href="https://www.instyle.com/hyaluronic-acid-and-retinol-7506676" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;/a&gt; to deeply hydrate your delicate eye area. As a result, the affordable skin care find will leave you with smoother, tighter, refreshed-looking under-eyes. (It’s like a cup of coffee for your skin.) To experience its benefits, gently apply a pea-sized amount of The Inkey List’s formula before moisturizing. Pro tip: For extra depuffing, store the eye cream in the fridge.

chronic condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. For people with POTS, simply standing up can cause their heart rate to spike, often leading to dizziness or even fainting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the symptoms go far beyond that. Many people also experience chest pain, blackouts, nausea, fatigue, headaches, brain fog, digestive issues, shaking, and difficulty sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that POTS affects between &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2024/10/living-pots-understanding-condition-affects-millions" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;1 to 3 million&lt;/a&gt; people in the U.S., most of them women. Public figures like singer &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/05/10/halsey-health-diagnosis-ehlers-danlos-mast-cell-activation-syndrome-pots/9722199002/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Halsey&lt;/a&gt; and Olympic swimmer &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/katie-ledecky-pots-rcna165216" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Katie Ledecky&lt;/a&gt; have spoken out about their experiences with the condition, helping to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no cure, POTS isn’t life-threatening and doesn’t shorten your life expectancy. It can often be managed with medication, lifestyle changes, and a careful balance of diet and physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the condition can get worse depending on what’s happening in your body. Common triggers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strenuous physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illness or infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing or walking for long periods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hot weather or hot showers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menstruation or pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recovering from surgery or injury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, symptoms can be kept under control with relatively minor adjustments. But for others, POTS can be debilitating. Some struggle to walk even short distances. Some are bedridden and need help just getting to the bathroom. About 50% of people with POTS are &lt;a href="https://bjcardio.co.uk/2016/03/a-profile-of-patients-with-postural-tachycardia-syndrome-and-their-experience-of-healthcare-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;unable to attend work or school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite all this, it’s still wildly misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume it’s not a serious condition because common symptoms don’t seem severe. Even some medical professionals aren’t familiar with it, which means many individuals don’t even realize they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the average time from first symptoms to a diagnosis is &lt;a href="https://www.potsuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PoTS_10_things_you_need_to_know_Oct2021.pdf" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;seven years&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, up to &lt;a href="http://85%%20of%20patients%20say%20they%20were%20told%20their%20symptoms%20were%20%E2%80%9Call%20in%20their%20head%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;85% of patients&lt;/a&gt; say they were told their symptoms were “all in their head” and misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression, despite research showing POTS patients are no more likely to have psychiatric conditions than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="40-1" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/woman-yelled-using-wheelchair/?image_id=40-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Guy Sees Woman In Wheelchair, Decides He’s Suddenly A Medical Expert" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-yelled-using-wheelchair/?media_id=40-1" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/40-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8680742" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/40-1.jpg" alt="Guy Sees Woman In Wheelchair, Decides He’s Suddenly A Medical Expert" title="Guy Sees Woman In Wheelchair, Decides He’s Suddenly A Medical Expert" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/unrecognizable-young-disabled-woman-in-wheelchair-at-the-at-home-in-her-living-room-close-up-of-her-arm-laid-on-wheel-TgMCJFZM6p0" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Getty Images / Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How you can support someone with POTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those without a disability, it can be easy to overlook how inaccessible the world is and how often people with invisible conditions are treated unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UK survey by &lt;a href="https://www.fishinsurance.co.uk/survey-reveals-prejudice-towards-people-with-invisible-disabilities/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Fish Insurance&lt;/a&gt; found that 39% of respondents believed people with valid disability parking permits shouldn’t use accessible parking if they didn’t appear to be struggling to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more shockingly, 18% said that people who did show visible difficulty, like a limp or a prosthetic, shouldn’t be allowed to use those spots either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of thinking isn’t just uninformed, it’s harmful. It also shows why empathy and education matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do to support someone living with POTS? &lt;a href="https://www.guidetopots.com/?page_id=212" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Guide to POTS&lt;/a&gt; offers these helpful suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, start by truly listening. If someone with POTS opens up about what they’re experiencing, give them space to share and take their concerns seriously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be there for them in ways that work for their energy and mobility levels. They might not be able to attend concerts or events that involve lots of walking or standing, but that doesn’t mean you can’t spend quality time together. Suggest a movie night at home or a low-key hangout instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you do end up going out, try to be flexible and patient. They may not be up for a long walk on a hot summer day or keeping a fast pace, but grabbing a bite to eat at a local café could be perfect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And finally, take a bit of time to learn about the condition yourself. You’ll get a much better idea of what daily life with POTS can be like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, lead with kindness. Living with a misunderstood condition like POTS can feel isolating, but knowing someone is willing to show up and listen can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The woman later revealed she couldn’t believe he was serious at first, until he kept going&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="10-6822f9ed82db9__700"

So, when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-853857c0-2f40-11f0-a288-bfe0bf43e896"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, her world was turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 36-year-old mother of two was determined to beat her diagnosis - which has a survival rate of 13 percent - and she 'hit the ground running' and started an aggressive chemotherapy regimen in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's been been hit with painful side effects and medical bills that could exceed half a million dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her husband, Corey Candrilli, a disabled US Army combat veteran said: 'I don’t understand exactly what she’s going through, but I understand pain. I understand the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to try and remove tumors, but her fight isn't over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said his wife's delayed diagnosis - she visited multiple doctors and had her symptoms dismissed - puts a spotlight on the need for a law that would require insurance companies to cover colonoscopies for younger patients with certain symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonscopies are the gold standard for screening for the disease, which is on the rise in young people across the US. They are typically recommended to begin at 45 and occur every 10 years so long as results are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lack of - and confusion over - insurance coverage has led people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556451/reason-colon-cancer-cases-rising-colonoscopy-charges.html"&gt;delay screening or has burdened them with bills for thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli is a mom-of-two who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On most insurance plans, the procedure should cost on average $79 out-of-pocket, with health insurers footing the rest of the about $2,125 bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, patients have come forward to say they've been charged upward of $5,000, $7,000 and even $20,000 for the procedure, despite having health insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple live in New York, where the law requires insurance coverage for colonoscopies only for people 45 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t get it. It’s unbelievable,’' Mr Candrilli &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.silive.com/news/2025/05/amazing-young-mother-battles-stage-4-colon-cancer-after-delayed-diagnosis.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; SI Live of colonoscopies before 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s truly unbelievable. These are your teachers, your parents, people raising your children. These are our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The army veteran said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but, 'when you're about that age, you're busy rising a family, and the last thing you're going to be thinking about is yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli was tested for the chronic autoimmune diseases crohn's and celiac, but the couple said a colonoscopy was never suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an ultrasound of Mrs Candrilli's stomach detected something on her liver, then a colonoscopy was performed, which revealed an aggressively growing tumor that had spread to other parts of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said: 'As soon as they ordered the colonoscopy, they saw the tumor right there on her colon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cory Candrilli, an army veteran, said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but a colonoscopy was never suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After undergoing 20 rounds of chemotherapy, Mrs Candrilli is awaiting a liver transplant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli underwent surgery to remove a portion of her colon and is now awaiting a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her initial surgery, she has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy, which her husband said are shrinking the tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These sessions required her to spend four hours in the hospital every two weeks to receive the medication and then wear an external device that continued delivering chemotherapy to her for 48 hours after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the treatments are working, Mr Candrilli said the family cannot keep up with medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It’s ridiculously expensive. Insurance is helpful, but we’ve been told that, even with insurance, this can go up to at least $500,000.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with medical bills as Mrs Candrilli stopped working as a nanny before becoming a mother and supporting her husband after he suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told SI Live: 'She's the greatest medicine I've ever had my whole life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 67 percent of adults adhere to current screening requirements, below the US government target of at least 70 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer often causes no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But warning signs can include trouble using the bathroom, blood in feces and persistent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The couple said the treatments are working, but they cannot keep up with medical bills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli is mom to the Candrillis' two sons, Lucas, 2, and James, 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors fear that, faced with the risk of high prices, patients may put off any screenings — which can find pre-cancerous growths and eliminate them, slashing the risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also put off screenings even when they have symptoms, risking the cancer reaching an advanced stage — making it harder to treat and deadlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, told DailyMail.com: 'The majority of people who do preventative screening should have very little out-of-pocket cost, regardless of where they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But there are horror stories, with the exception being when someone goes out of network for their physical or hospital.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are putting off colonoscopies worrying about costs, then this means these aren't removed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Screening reveals benign polyps that aren't cancer, but by removing them we are reducing the risk of cancer developing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you put off screening and don't do anything, there's certainly a much higher probability that when you go in, you have symptoms,' which may raise the risk of being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 04:03:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
