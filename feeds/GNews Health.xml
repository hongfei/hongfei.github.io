The team at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.phage-collection.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Phage Collection Project&lt;/a&gt; sent me some vials to collect samples, along with a pair of gloves.

I didn't flush the toilet after a poo and left it for a couple of hours. I pop on a glove and hold my breath as I go in for the final sample. Strict hygiene instructions, including vigorous hand-washing, were followed, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vials were packaged up for collection and then three days later I headed off to the University of Southampton to see what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They were a bit dirty when I received them," phage scientist Michelle Lin tells me as we don our blue lab-coats and matching gloves to go into the Containment Level 2 microbiology laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We grab my samples from the fridge, which look much clearer now they have been filtered of any… debris. "It's fine, it's needed," Michelle, who had the unpleasant job, reassures me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Michelle Lin holding the cleaned up sample of my toilet water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Filtering is the first step in looking for phage, next they get served dinner – a cocktail of yummy bacteria - to help them grow in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now comes the really cool bit – finding a useful phage. The scientists have been working with the local hospital to collect bacteria from patients with troublesome infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Michelle grabs a petri dish that's growing bacteria from a patient with a painful, urinary tract infection that keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And to my amazement – one of the phage I collected from my toilet was able to kill this infection in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The way to see that the phage has infected bacteria is you get these zones where the bacteria are not growing and that's because they've been killed by the phage," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The small off-white areas are where the bacteria are still growing, but in most of the sample petri dish there are dead zones where the phage has gorged on the bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;You can see the leopard print pattern in the petri dish where the phage have been making light work of a bacterial infection that modern medicine was struggling to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As crazy as it sounds, well done to the toilet sample," says Michelle with great delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And when I was offered the chance to name the phage, well of course it's the Gallagher-phage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Sounds amazing to me," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far this is all good fun in the laboratory, but could my phage ever be given to a patient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Yes and I hope so," says associate professor Dr Franklin Nobrega as we look at images of my phage captured with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The virus has been named the Gallagher-phage, after me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Your phage, already in just 24 hours, we were able to get in a high concentration and able to be a very good killer, which means this is very promising for patients, so thank you," said Dr Nobrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Phage remind me of a moon lander – a big capsule on spindly legs – just instead of landing on the surface of the moon they use their legs to select their victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They then hijack the bacteria and transform it into a mass-production factory for more phage, which burst out of their host, killing it in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are pros and cons to phage. They reproduce as they go along so you don't need constant doses like you would with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are also very picky eaters. You need a precise match between phage and the strain of bacteria you're trying to treat whereas antibiotics tend to kill everything good and bad. So it is harder to find the right phage, but if you do it comes with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Nobrega tells me infected wounds are a "very good application" for phage because you can apply them directly to the injury, but they can also be inhaled via a nebuliser to treat lung infections or to target urinary tract infections "which is our target currently".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The phage has a five spindly legs a corkscrew body and then atop it sits an angular capsule.

Even as late as the 1940s there was an active pharmaceutical industry in western countries trying to produce phage-therapy to defeat bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, it was rapidly eclipsed by the wonder-drug of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Antibiotics were working so well that most people said 'why bother'," says Dr Nobrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6df9/live/1edf8a40-5379-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="University of Southampton A grey image showing more than a dozen hexagonal shapes with a long tail attached." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;More than a dozen "Gallagher phage" as seen through an electron microscope.

By 2050, that figure is projected to reach 10 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This "antibiotic apocalypse" would mean common infections could kill again and undermine modern medicine. The drugs are also used to make organ transplants, open surgery and chemotherapy possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The predictions around antibiotic resistance are very frightening, but the reality is we're seeing it now and it's only going to get worse," says Prof Paul Elkington, the director of the institute for medical innovation at the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The Phage Collection Project team at the University of Southampton are keen to get samples from the public&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He is also a doctor with a speciality in lung medicine and is already at the point where - after a year of treatment and turning to ever more toxic and less effective antibiotics - "in the end you have to have a conversation [and say] 'we can't treat this infection, we're really sorry'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says we can't rely solely on antibiotics in the future and phage are a potential alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he warns the steps needed to get from the laboratory and into patients are "uncharted".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Things are changing. Phage therapy is available in the UK on compassionate grounds when other treatments have failed.

			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests eating more antioxidant-rich foods may lower cognitive decline risk by 80%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants who ate the most foods rich in vitamins, magnesium, zinc and selenium had the best outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts, leafy greens, berries, whole grains and more plant-based foods are great sources of antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you misplace your keys for the third time in a week or blank on a close friend’s name, it’s hard not to wonder: Is this normal aging—or something more? Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition marked by subtle but noticeable changes in memory and thinking. And it’s surprisingly common among older adults. It affects nearly one third of people over age 65, and for many, it’s an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;early warning sign of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike normal age-related forgetfulness, mild cognitive impairment can make it harder to manage daily tasks and can progress into more serious cognitive decline. While there’s still no cure for Alzheimer’s or other dementias, researchers are zeroing in on strategies to help delay or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. Diet is one of the most promising—and controllable—factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many studies have suggested that antioxidant-rich foods may protect the brain, but questions remain: How much do they help? And what about other common habits, like drinking alcohol—does it cancel out any benefits? To explore these questions, researchers looked at the relationship between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol consumption, and the risk of mild cognitive impairment in older adults. They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;—and the results may inspire you to rethink what’s on your plate and in your glass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a cross-sectional study, meaning it looked at data from a single point in time rather than following participants over a period of years. Researchers gathered data from 1,084 adults aged 55 and older living in Zhejiang Province, China. Participants answered questions about their diet, lifestyle, alcohol consumption and health history. They completed a cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a widely used tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers used a validated dietary questionnaire to calculate a Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) for each person. The CDAI is based on six key antioxidants: vitamins A, C and E, as well as magnesium, zinc and selenium. Participants were sorted into four groups based on their CDAI scores, from lowest to highest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found a clear pattern: people with higher antioxidant index scores had lower odds of having mild cognitive impairment—up to an 80% reduced risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these risk reduction benefits aren’t for everybody across the board. When researchers looked at how alcohol and antioxidants interacted, they found that the protective effects of antioxidants were only statistically significant among people who didn’t drink alcohol at all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, drinking any alcohol seemed to cancel out some of the brain benefits of a high-antioxidant diet. And  people who drank alcohol one to two times a week had more than double the odds of having mild cognitive impairment compared to non-drinkers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, because this was a cross-sectional study, it can only show associations—not cause and effect. The dietary data was also self-reported, and people aren’t always 100% inaccurate when remembering what they ate. And while the study accounted for many factors that might influence brain health (like age, education and depression), it didn’t account for the amount or type of alcohol consumed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings support what many nutrition experts have been saying for years: antioxidants help protect the brain and alcohol—despite the hype around red wine—may do more harm than good when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more antioxidants to your diet, focus on getting a variety of colorful, whole, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;. Some great options include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt; (spinach, kale) for magnesium and vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berries and citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots, sweet potatoes, and winter squash&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-11758822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (especially sunflower seeds and almonds) for vitamin E and selenium&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of reaching for a glass of wine in hopes of getting antioxidants, reach for a fruit salad or a handful of nuts. Foods provide a broader mix of beneficial nutrients—and without the potential downsides of alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even small dietary upgrades can help. Try tossing sunflower seeds on your salad, snacking on oranges or blending spinach into a smoothie. If you're already eating some antioxidant-rich foods, think about how you can include even more variety.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D may help prevent heart disease or related events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart disease continues to rank as the top most lethal disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speak with a healthcare provider before starting a vitamin supplement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may already know that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.—back in 2022, around one in five deaths in the U.S. was due to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, experts are projecting that by 2035, 45% of American adults will be living with heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that dying from heart disease is highly preventable, and scientists are continually looking for ways to prevent it. Besides lifestyle habits, like a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, managing stressors and getting plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-longevity-11758701" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are specific nutrients that may be particularly helpful. Vitamin D is one of them, as evidence suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low blood levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; may increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is a tricky nutrient because very few foods contain it. Our bodies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manufacture vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when we’re exposed to sunlight. But enough of the body needs to be exposed—arms, legs and face—for long enough, which poses some potential problems for people trying to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11736017" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prevent skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; or who easily burn. It’s also difficult for those who live in colder winter climates to get enough skin exposure year-round. For this reason, vitamin D is one of the vitamins that may need to be supplemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers did a narrative review of studies on vitamin D and heart disease. They reported their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched databases for studies on vitamin D and cardiovascular disease and reported the studies’ findings. As they narrowed down the field of studies, the researchers considered studies that used &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplementation&lt;/a&gt; or assessed participants’ level of vitamin D with bloodwork.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this was a narrative review, they didn’t analyze the data; they simply reported the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that while the mechanisms by which vitamin D reduces heart disease risk are well understood, clinical evidence of these benefits remains scant, due to a lack of well-designed studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, here are some of the major findings researchers picked up in their review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 60%, gestational diabetes by 50% and preterm delivery by 40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with prediabetes may be able to significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by supplementing with vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In people taking statins (to help lower cholesterol) or cardiovascular medications, supplementing with vitamin D may lower the risk of major cardiovascular events by 13% to 17%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Limitations of any narrative review include difficulty finding high-quality studies and bias in interpreting the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that vitamin D is essential for many bodily processes, including healthy bones and immune and nerve function. There is also evidence that vitamin D may play a role in preventing depression. Regarding heart disease, more and more evidence is stacking up in vitamin D’s favor. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11735001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that suggests that vitamin D deficiency may increase your risk of heart disease by 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a vitamin that people are commonly deficient in. And researchers do not always agree on who and how much people should supplement. The only way to know if you’re deficient in vitamin D is to be tested, but some professional organizations, like the Endocrine Society, state that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;, and that most people do not need to supplement. So, how do you know?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some things to consider include where you live, how often you get outside with skin exposed and how many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; you eat. Foods that contain vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring, swordfish, sardines), beef liver, cod liver oil and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, like milk, orange juice and cereal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, adults over 70, children and teens require more vitamin D. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;if you’re pregnant or have osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to increase your intake, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of where you’re at in the life cycle, if you know you’re not regularly eating vitamin D foods or getting outside often and long enough with enough skin exposure, it’s probably feasible to request a blood test from a medical professional. If the test suggests you’re deficient, talk to them or seek the advice of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;registered dietitian regarding supplementation&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Seeking professional advice is important because vitamin D is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;. If you take too much over time, it can build up in your body and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;can even become lethal&lt;/a&gt;. So, having a health professional work with you find the dose that’s right for you can be helpful.

Two years later, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor and says he has been cancer-free ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors remain fiercely skeptical, warning that even the strictest vegan diet cannot replace chemotherapy or immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fremont claims that the plant-based diet and healthy lifestyle cured his colorectal metastases. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, and doctors gave the now-103-year-old three months to live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While a healthy diet plays a supportive role in cancer care, doctors argue it must be combined with medical treatments. Nutrition alone cannot eliminate cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer experts previously told the Daily Mail they are seeing &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14806089/ananda-lewis-breast-cancer-rise-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;a 'concerning' rise&lt;/a&gt; of patients using controversial treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study found 70 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine, one in three of that share use it as their sole method of treatment and 27 percent hid it from their oncologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Heber &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/diet-for-your-diagnosis-nutrition-plays-prime-role-in-treating-cancer"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt;: 'A nutritious diet should be used along with proper treatments in cancer patients, but diet alone absolutely cannot cure cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 75 percent of colorectal cancer patients will be alive five years after their diagnosis with treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without treatment, survival rates drop to just 44 percent after three years, making medical intervention absolutely crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A former Yale University wrestler, Fremont had been an avid runner since the 70s when he was grieving the death of his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first of more than a dozen marathons was the 1972 Boston Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why it was so shocking when Fremont got the world-upending news in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.greatveganathletes.com/mike-fremont-vegan-runner/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I contracted a cancer which the Cleveland Clinic said would kill me in 3 months unless operated upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said no, I was going on a diet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The tumor had metastasized into my lymphatic system and would have required efforts to treat the metastases with radiation and/or chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later he underwent an operation to remove the tumor from his colon when it began to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the procedure, doctors checked for cancer spread in 35 places around Fremont’s body, he said, and found zero signs of cancer spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont believes that his stellar health and advanced age are primarily due to his habits, rather than genetics. His father died of liver cancer, and his mother of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘The results of the diet have been perfect and it has been since that diet that all my world records have come about as well as such distinction in the US.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And he doesn’t plan on slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My route is 5 miles long, through a scenic park near Cincinnati with mixed surface, lots of hills,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The first mile is at my maximum speed, the other four under pressure to run fast. I resolved at age 98 to run 5 miles rather than 10, but to do it at speed.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont has always followed a disciplined fitness plan, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/heres-how-this-103-year-old-runner-defeated-cancer-arthritis-without-medicines-19627886.htm"&gt;saying he runs&lt;/a&gt; five miles three times a week and incorporating push-ups and pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical day of eating for Fremont begins with oatmeal, syrup, and blueberries for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lunch consists of beans, while dinner includes broccoli florets topped with ketchup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data from JAMA Surgery showed colon cancer is expected to rise by 90 percent in people ages 20 to 34 by 2030&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont also lives a low-stress lifestyle, using exercise as a form of emotional release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also does not drink or smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His healthy lifestyle has been shown to prevent cancer and its recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a structured exercise program for stage II and III colon cancer patients reduced recurrence by 28 percent, lowered mortality risk by 37 percent over eight years, and showed benefits with just 1.5 to 2.25 hours of brisk walking weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Focusing on whole, unprocessed plant foods increases the amount of beneficial nutrients and compounds taken in that help reduce inflammation, a key factor in cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, these dietary choices can support healthy weight, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control, all of which contribute to a lower cancer risk &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there is no concrete evidence diet alone can reverse cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Is Greta Thunberg the literal antichrist? Are the three predominant ideological schools in Europe environmentalism, "Islamic Shariah law" and "Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover"? Is AI "woke" and capable of following Elon Musk to Mars? Peter seems to think so! Perhaps the "just asking questions" school of journalism could add "&lt;em&gt;hey, what the fuck are you talking about&lt;/em&gt;" to its repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, many of these assertions fall squarely into the realm of things that exist within Thiel's mind palace rather than verifiable facts, with at least one notable exception. Relatively early in their chat, Peter tells Ross the following [emphasis ours]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at biotech, something like dementia, Alzheimer’s — &lt;strong&gt;we’ve made zero progress in 40 to 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;. People are completely stuck on beta amyloids. It’s obviously not working. It’s just some kind of a stupid racket where the people are just reinforcing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty bold claim! It's also completely untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no treatment 40 or 50 years ago for Alzheimer's disease," Sterling Johnson, a professor of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told Engadget. "What we've been able to do in the last 20 years has been actually pretty extraordinary. We've developed markers that help us identify when this disease starts, using the using amyloid markers and tau biomarkers, we know that the disease actually begins 20 years before the symptoms do, and that is a critical thing to know if we are going to prevent this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Alzheimer's remains incurable. But the absence of a miracle cure does not negate the accomplishments thus far in detection and prevention. "The first treatments were these window dressing treatments. It's like treating the symptoms like you would treat a cold [...] The first generation of amyloid therapy was that kind of approach where it just addressed the symptoms by amping up the neurons and increasing the neurotransmitters available to the to the brain cells." Johnson, whose team runs one of the largest and longest &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://wrap.wisc.edu/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on people at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, added, "Now we have opportunities to actually modify the disease biology through the amyloid pathway, but also we're focused on the other proteinopathy — which is &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauopathy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; — and there's clinical trials underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiel, a well-known advocate for advancements in radical life extension (including a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood?srsltid=AfmBOorWPpJna-9f4HpVxwkhBkh_6IbM-7PPlpHzAhmc5HoK02GTRv4s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; interest in injecting himself with the blood of young people) sees the state of scientific research in this area as sluggish and risk averse. But the groundbreaking work is happening at this moment. Professor Johnson pointed to a monoclonal antibody called &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/roche-alzheimer-drug-could-prevent-onset/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gantenerumab;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt;. In an early test of 73 participants with inherited mutations that would cause them to overproduce amyloid in the brain, it cut the number of participants who developed Alzheimer's symptoms practically in half. "The big phase-three prevention trials are happening right now." Those are using lecanemab and donanemab, two other monoclonal treatments, which Johnson clarified are "already known to be better than gantenerumab at clearing out beta-amyloid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who fashions himself as a heterodox thinker, Thiel certainly seems to have stumbled on a remarkably similar talking point to current Trump administration FDA head Robert F Kennedy Jr. "Alzheimer's is a very, very good example of how [National Institute of Health] has gone off the rails over the past 20 years ago with research on amyloid plaques" Kennedy &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DzkPRscLkpQ?si=PS-Qgx5bZFIrVGxG&amp;amp;t=1319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a Department of Health budgetary hearing last month. He claimed the NIH was "cutting off any other hypothesis" due to "corruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Alzheimer's Association has called this "demonstrably false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In reality, over the most recent 10 years available (2014-2023), &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://iadrp.nia.nih.gov/visualization?t=&amp;amp;disease_op=or&amp;amp;class_op=or&amp;amp;class%5B%5D=73737&amp;amp;p_title=&amp;amp;p_num=&amp;amp;p_type_op=or&amp;amp;fun_year=&amp;amp;pi_ln=&amp;amp;pi_fn=&amp;amp;a_org_op=or&amp;amp;a_country_op=or&amp;amp;f_org_op=or&amp;amp;f_org%5B%5D=59956&amp;amp;f_country_op=or&amp;amp;field_program_official_op=or&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2023&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2022&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2021&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2020&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2019&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2018&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2017&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2016&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2015&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2014&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73737&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_org%3A59956&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_p_type%3A733&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_disease%3A19045&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73776&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73777&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73778&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73779&amp;amp;plot_by=projects&amp;amp;summarized=therapeutic_target_name&amp;amp;refine_by=total&amp;amp;chart_type=pie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less than 14%;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less than 14%&lt;/a&gt; of new National Institutes of Health (NIH) Alzheimer’s projects focused on amyloid beta as the therapeutic target," the organization &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.alz.org/news/2025/kennedy-harmful-myths-alzheimers-dementia-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, "As of September 2024, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/ongoing-AD-trials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Institute on Aging;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; was investing in 495 pharmacological and non-pharmacological trials.

Participants who took the supplement daily for two months showed significant improvements in several domains of memory and spatial reasoning compared to those who took a placebo. The supplement was also well-tolerated, with no significant side effects reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, refers to a decline in memory or thinking skills that is noticeable but does not yet interfere significantly with daily life. People with MCI are at a higher risk of developing dementia later in life, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no approved medications specifically for treating MCI, and many people turn to lifestyle interventions such as exercise, diet changes, and cognitive training to slow cognitive decline. Herbal supplements have also gained attention, with ashwagandha — a plant long used in traditional Indian medicine — often recommended for stress, anxiety, and cognitive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha, also known by its botanical name &lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;, has a long history of use in Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India. Recent research has suggested that its compounds may have neuroprotective properties. In particular, Sominone — a metabolite derived from one of the plant’s active constituents — has shown promise in animal studies. It has been found to support the growth of nerve cells, protect neurons from damage, and enhance memory performance. The current study was designed to test whether a standardized extract of ashwagandha containing Sominone (called Somin-On™) could produce similar effects in humans diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study at a medical center in Jhansi, India. A total of 40 adults with MCI were selected to participate after meeting specific inclusion criteria. Participants were between the ages of 25 and 65 and had mild memory problems as measured by common clinical tests. They were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of Somin-On™ or a placebo capsule once daily for 60 days. Both participants and researchers were unaware of who received the treatment and who received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several standardized tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III), and the Shepard Mental Rotation Task. These assessments were administered at the beginning of the study, halfway through, and again at the end. The researchers focused on changes in immediate memory, general memory, working memory, attention, and visuospatial processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Compared to those taking a placebo, participants in the Somin-On™ group showed consistent and statistically significant improvements across nearly all domains tested. Improvements were already evident after 30 days of treatment and became more pronounced by the end of the 60-day study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shepard Mental Rotation Task, which assesses spatial reasoning and mental imagery, showed a 12% increase in performance at 30 days and a 32% increase at 60 days among those taking Somin-On™, while the placebo group showed a decline by the end of the study. Similar trends were seen in the Wechsler Memory Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In measures of immediate memory, participants taking the supplement improved by about 7% at 60 days, while those in the placebo group actually declined slightly. General memory scores rose nearly 15% in the treatment group, compared to only a small increase in the placebo group. Working memory improved by over 18% in those taking Somin-On™, with negligible change in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two widely used screening tools, MoCA and MMSE, also showed marked improvement. MoCA scores in the treatment group rose nearly 15% from baseline, and MMSE scores increased by more than 19%. Both improvements were significantly higher than those observed in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement was also well-tolerated. No participants in either group reported any adverse side effects, and standard blood tests and liver and kidney function markers remained stable throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the cognitive benefits of Somin-On™ may stem from its neuroprotective mechanisms. Previous animal research has shown that Sominone, the main active ingredient, can enhance the growth of neural connections and reverse memory deficits caused by damage to brain cells. It has also been shown to improve spatial memory and reduce brain cell shrinkage in models of Alzheimer’s disease, without necessarily affecting other markers like amyloid plaques. These findings hint at a potential mode of action involving the growth and maintenance of neural networks, rather than targeting traditional hallmarks of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible mechanisms include increased resistance to oxidative stress, improvements in mitochondrial function, and support for cholinergic signaling — all of which have been linked to memory function in the brain. Inflammation and excitotoxicity, two processes involved in neurodegeneration, have also been shown to be reduced by components of ashwagandha in previous studies. Although the current study did not examine these mechanisms directly, the cognitive improvements observed may reflect the result of one or more of these biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging findings, the study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, with only 40 participants. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results and better understand how widely they apply. Second, the duration of the study was limited to two months. It is unclear whether the benefits of Somin-On™ persist over a longer period or whether the supplement could help prevent further decline. Third, the study did not use imaging techniques or biological markers to assess brain changes, so the underlying processes behind the cognitive improvements remain speculative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the absence of an active comparator group. The study compared Somin-On™ to a placebo, but did not compare it to other forms of ashwagandha or to other cognitive-enhancing treatments. Since ashwagandha contains multiple bioactive compounds, future studies could investigate whether Sominone alone is responsible for the observed benefits or if the effects arise from a broader mix of constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future trials should include a more diverse participant pool, longer follow-up, and potentially integrate imaging or biomarker data to explore how ashwagandha affects brain structure and function. It would also be valuable to test the supplement in combination with other non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as cognitive training or physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251324377" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract with Sominone (Somin-On™) to improve memory in adults with mild cognitive impairment: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hari Prakash Rai and Deo Nidhi Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:04:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQW9pQ0NQYTFrOEQtQnFiTEtPVnRRS09MVWVuXzlmb1pEM282Q1hCUUJtaXNBSHFzZG5FTGFRWjQwN3RTV2dkVU1SakJ6VU54U19OT2hKQ24wc1hBOEZJZmlUU2ZoQVN0Z2c2NnBXalpyUTU1eHpQWjdoYUV2N2dvVEF4aVI4WlZfeXdFc3ppTmQ0MGRqOUdGT1Y5cDJsZUJhSHhCZ0hVVTdReGZ5cHNnenVaWlFVbjNaemo5eUtiNkEtbHM</guid></item><item><title>什么是硫柳汞？研究对RFK Jr.抨击下的疫苗防腐剂的评价- PBS | What is thimerosal?

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/26/thimerosal-vaccines-flu-shot-RFK-mercury/"&gt;PolitiFact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first meeting of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recently downsized vaccine panel, the group voted to stop recommending flu vaccines containing thimerosal, a vaccine preservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lengthy &lt;a href="https://archive.fo/ZbCAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;June 24 X post&lt;/a&gt; that preceded the meeting, Kennedy, who spent two decades as an antivaccine movement leader, described thimerosal using terms such as “toxic” and said hundreds of studies identify it as a carcinogenic “potent neurotoxin.” He also said there are high doses of mercury in flu shots recommended to pregnant women and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/acip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;’ two-day meeting on June 25 and 26 included &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-jr#:~:text=A%20key%20vaccine%20advisory%20panel,anti%2Dvaccine%20activists%20for%20decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;discussion of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; containing thimerosal before its vote on flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-committee-to-vote-on-flu-shots-and-preservative-thimerosal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; RFK Jr.’s vaccine committee endorses flu shots, except those with preservative thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is an independent group that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;provides vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; the CDC director reviews and decides whether to formally adopt. Earlier in June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; 17 ACIP members, replacing them with seven new members, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/11/rfk-cdc-vaccine-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; people who’ve &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;expressed doubt about vaccine efficacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/06/who-robert-malone-joe-rogans-guest-was-vaccine-sci/"&gt;promoted antivaccine falsehoods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists who study vaccines have been researching thimerosal’s use for decades. Here’s what to know about the vaccine preservative and its removal from flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used in some vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people — particularly those who are pregnant or breastfeeding — encounter &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-and-fish/art-20044185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; consuming mercury, such as in seafood. But those warnings are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;methylmercury&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in certain kinds of fish and is known to be toxic to people when consumed at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal contains ethylmercury — a single-letter difference that might not sound significant, but is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human bodies can break down and excrete ethylmercury quickly, meaning it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to cause harm. By contrast, methylmercury is more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;accumulate&lt;/a&gt; in the body and cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vaccines, thimerosal is added to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;prevent harmful microbes&lt;/a&gt; such as bacteria and fungi from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing in vaccine vials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration,” the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt; said. “Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal has been at the heart of Kennedy’s antivaccine activism for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-environmental-toxins-cause-autism"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Fact-checking RFK Jr.’s claim that environmental toxins cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Kennedy wrote an article co-published by Rolling Stone and Salon that alleged leading health agencies including the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration had colluded with vaccine manufacturers to conceal a study that found thimerosal “may have caused autism in thousands of kids.” Scientists and researchers &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-campaign-of-conspiracy-theori/"&gt;said Kennedy’s argument&lt;/a&gt; was inaccurate and misleading. Continued research has found no link between thimerosal and autism. Kennedy’s article &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rolling-stone-retracts-autism-article-but-lots-of-junk-journalism-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;was removed from Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Salon retracted&lt;/a&gt; it in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Kennedy wrote a book opposing thimerosal’s use in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Which vaccines use thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All vaccines the CDC &lt;a href="https://aap2.silverchair-cdn.com/aap2/content_public/cms/resources/15585/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;routinely recommends&lt;/a&gt; for children age 6 or younger are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;available without thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children receiving the routine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pediatric vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; “can get completely immunized without any thimerosal-containing vaccines,” said Dr. Mark Sawyer, a pediatrics professor at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and a pediatric infectious disease physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some childhood vaccines &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have never contained&lt;/a&gt; thimerosal. These include the measles, mumps, rubella or MMR vaccine, the varicella or chickenpox vaccine, the inactivated polio vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from most vaccines — including all childhood vaccines — as of 2001, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is still used in vaccines today, but not as widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservative is in only a small fraction of influenza vaccine vials, specifically the multi-dose vials that constitute a small portion of the U.S. flu shot supply, Dr. Jake Scott told PolitiFact. Scott is a Stanford University School of Medicine infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA said &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135735/https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;thimerosal use has declined&lt;/a&gt; as vaccine manufacturers have developed more single-dose vaccines that do not require preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott said the CDC lists 12 influenza vaccine formulations for the 2024 to 2025 flu season, which will also cover the 2025 to 2026 season because no new flu vaccines have been licensed. Of those 12 vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just three&lt;/a&gt; are multi-dose vaccines that contain thimerosal at 25 micrograms — equal to 25 millionths of a gram — per dose, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC’s supply data shows single-dose, thimerosal-free syringes &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-to-know-about-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-from-bygone-flu-shot-debate#:~:text=Why%20is%20thimerosal%20controversial?,and%20replaces%20expert%20former%20members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;make up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/acip-recommends-adults-receive-seasonal-single-dose-influenza-vaccines-free-of-thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about 96%&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. flu vaccine supply, leaving roughly 4% as multi-dose vials, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Single-dose syringes are the default for pediatrics and prenatal care, so real-world exposure is even lower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because flu vaccines with thimerosal constitute a small portion of the influenza vaccine supply, public health experts told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/26/rfk-jr-acip-thimerosal-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s vote to stop recommending them would have a limited impact, although it could make flu shots more expensive and less accessible in some parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does research show about thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because antivaccine activists’ focus has centered on whether thimerosal causes autism, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/197365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595043/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/126/4/656/65633/Prenatal-and-Infant-Exposure-to-Thimerosal-From?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; investigated a potential link and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10997/chapter/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;no causal relationship&lt;/a&gt; between the preservative and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists evaluated thimerosal’s potential impacts and risks they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine researchers told PolitiFact that thimerosal was removed from vaccines out of an abundance of caution, not because research proved that thimerosal was unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was removed from vaccines because people thought it might cause problems, said Rachel Roper, a microbiology and immunology professor at East Carolina University. But ultimately, “studies were done and it was shown to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no evidence to-date that thimerosal “causes any harm whatsoever,” Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bilious blowout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors noted that his breath was fast and shallow, with crackling in his neck. But breathing sounds from the base of his right lung were quiet. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the problems. There was air in his chest space and into his neck. Fluid was also building up around his lungs, and his right lung was collapsing. The scan also showed a perforation in the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors inserted a chest tube to remove the fluid, which did not include gastric contents, suggesting the fluid build-up was from chest inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors then did an additional X-ray exam of the esophagus using a water-soluble contrast agent. This clearly revealed a large gash in the man's esophagus resulting from the robust eruption. The imaging also showed the contrast agent leaking out into the man's chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors quickly sent the man into emergency surgery to repair his esophagus. He spent the next 35 days in the hospital recovering. When he was discharged, he still had a feeding tube that passed through his nose and into his small intestine. It took an additional three months for the perforation to completely heal, at which point doctors could finally remove the feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear what causes Boerhaave syndrome. Researchers hypothesize that it occurs from a loss of neuromuscular coordination, which, in particular, causes the upper sphincter in the esophagus—the cricopharyngeus—to fail to relax at the onset of vomiting. The rapid rise of internal pressure overwhelms the esophagus, typically causing a lengthwise tear in the lower third of the tube, which is the weakest portion. On average, tears can be up to 8 centimeters (about 3 inches) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though researchers expect that cases are underreported, the estimated incidence based on reports is about three cases per million people globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cortisol helps regulate stress, sleep and metabolism—but chronic elevation can harm long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signs of high cortisol include poor sleep, visceral fat gain and feeling mentally alert but physically tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing stress, sleep, blood sugar and gut health can help reduce cortisol and chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve spent any time on social media lately, you’ve probably seen &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-when-you-wake-up-for-healthy-cortisol-levels-8784363" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; blamed for everything from visceral fat to burnout and sleepless nights. While it’s true that this stress hormone plays a role in how you feel, cortisol is essential for many everyday functions. “It helps regulate your body’s stress response, blood sugar, metabolism, inflammation and even your sleep-wake cycle,” says &lt;a href="https://rootfunctionalmedicine.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erica Armstrong, M.D., IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key is to keep cortisol in a healthy range, which healthy adrenal glands manage all on their own. If cortisol levels become too high for too long, you may start to notice some unpleasant side effects, and your health could be at risk. To untangle fact from fiction when it comes to cortisol, we spoke with physicians to understand what this stress hormone does, how to spot when it might be out of balance and steps you can take to manage inflammation and feel your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-cortisol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Cortisol? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cortisol is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands that plays an essential role in your health,” says Armstrong. This hormone naturally follows a 24-hour cycle, peaking 30 minutes after waking up, and declining during the day, with the lowest levels occurring during the early phases of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and surges during times of high stress. A burst of cortisol leads to high amounts of sugar released into the bloodstream for extra energy, vasoconstriction and increased heart rate to get your body ready for the “fight or flight” response.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This response is useful in a situation when you need to move or act quickly, but can create problems when it occurs too frequently, and without the follow-up of physical action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most cells in the body have cortisol receptors, meaning that this stress hormone impacts everything from your heart to your brain, metabolism, immune system and more. Chronically high cortisol levels are a biomarker for a number of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of the most common causes for elevated cortisol include chronic stress, insulin resistance, autoimmune diseases and Cushing’s syndrome, explains Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-signs-your-cortisol-may-be-high"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Signs Your Cortisol May Be High &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The only way to know if you have high cortisol levels is to see a medical professional.  “We always combine symptoms with lab testing (like a 4-point saliva cortisol test) and a full clinical picture before concluding whether cortisol is truly out of balance,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, these are some of the most common signs of high cortisol: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have trouble falling asleep at night or tend to wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep, it could have something to do with your stress hormones. “Cortisol should be low at night, but if it's spiking due to stress or blood sugar dips, it can wake you up in the middle of the night,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study of healthy individuals found that higher pre-sleep cortisol levels were associated with shorter and poorer sleep quality than lower pre-sleep cortisol levels.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A similar connection was also found among people with type 2 diabetes. Left unaddressed, poor sleep quality and short duration can lead to a number of health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease and all-cause mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You start gaining weight around your abdomen &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself holding on to extra weight around your midsection, despite no changes in your diet or exercise routines, it could be a sign of high cortisol levels. In one study of middle-aged and older adults, those with higher levels of hair cortisol were more likely to have a higher body weight and waist circumference than those with lower levels.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  “Cortisol promotes fat storage, especially around the midsection, as a survival mechanism,” says Armstrong. While the chances of elevated cortisol are higher in those with abdominal obesity, many people who may fall on the obesity scale do not have elevated cortisol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You feel “tired but wired”  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol helps your brain stay ready for impending danger, which can feel downright exhausting when you’re stuck in that state for too long. “Elevated cortisol can make you feel mentally alert even when you’re physically exhausted,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, even if you’re feeling mentally wired, chances are your brain isn’t operating at its best. High levels of cortisol, maintained over long periods, are associated with reduced cognitive function and impaired sleep, which can further impair mental functions such as memory and attention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-managing-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Managing Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working to lower elevated cortisol levels can help reduce chronic inflammation and the risk of inflammatory diseases. Here are other expert-approved ways to manage inflammation: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow an anti-inflammatory diet:&lt;/strong&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables and fiber-rich legumes can help support your body’s natural ability to regulate inflammation and stress. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to balance your blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stabilizing blood sugar through regular meals with protein, fat and fiber can calm both inflammation and cortisol spikes,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: Managing your mental, emotional and physical stress with adequate rest and prioritizing mental health and self-care activities can help reduce stress and inflammation. Research supports the use of mindfulness, meditation and relaxation interventions as effective ways to manage and lower cortisol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: “Even one night of poor sleep can elevate inflammatory markers,” says Armstrong. As inconsistent sleep is highly associated with inflammation, creating and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule and routine should be a top priority in your inflammation management plan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your gut health&lt;/strong&gt;: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating your immune system and controlling inflammation. “Addressing microbiome imbalances, food sensitivities, or underlying infections through personalized protocols can dramatically reduce systemic inflammation,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When operating correctly, your body has systems in place to regulate cortisol production and release for an appropriate stress response. So while most people do not have to worry about elevated cortisol, chronically high levels can cause unwanted side effects and increase the risk of inflammatory and metabolic health conditions. Difficulty sleeping, abdominal weight gain and feeling mentally wired but physically tired can indicate elevated cortisol levels; however, these symptoms could also be caused by a variety of other health conditions or imbalances. The best way to know for sure is to speak with a healthcare provider.

The result was a speedy extraction of the sperm that could at last fertilize an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K5PZXQUFNBF5VPK4KA6VSKMDGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers at the Columbia University Fertility Center say this procedure, conducted in March, amounts to the first-known use of AI-enabled conception using this particular technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEVTF373EZGAJKWFWQKVA43NOY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While AI has long been used in other ways to assist couples who want a baby, including assessing embryo viability, Columbia’s work shows how the technology can offer a chance at biological parenthood for those experiencing severe male infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="DS7SZAK5RNESBJJM5DCL7K6DPE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="DS7SZAK5RNESBJJM5DCL7K6DPE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OHJBBNVLNEPZBDEGN7WLF56AE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Normally, in-vitro fertilization involves taking sperm from a semen sample and fertilizing an egg.

As the sample flows, it is illuminated and imaged by a microscope linked to a high-speed camera. The system captures millions of individual frames.

Embryologists can spend hours manually scanning a semen sample in hopes of spotting a viable sperm cell.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insulin resistance is when your cells begin to lose their ability to use insulin efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forty percent of young and middle-aged U.S. adults have this condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many supplements sold to improve insulin resistance may make it worse or be dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four out of 10 U.S. adults ages 18 to 44 have insulin resistance—and most don’t even know it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But what is insulin resistance, anyway? This condition is when your cells begin to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;develop a tolerance to insulin&lt;/a&gt;, the hormone needed to push glucose into your cells for energy. When insulin doesn’t work as well as it used to, your pancreas responds by trying to make more of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a while, your body can compensate for this additional need until the pancreas struggles to produce the insulin required to keep cells energized. However, if it continues for long enough, it can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lead to prediabetes and eventually type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, if you have type 2 diabetes, you already have insulin resistance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s not clear exactly why insulin resistance happens, genetics and age are believed to play a role. It has also been &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7901433/surprising-link-between-chronic-inflammation-obesity/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked to overweight and obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Managing insulin resistance requires changes in lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, especially increasing physical activity to “use up” blood sugar. Recommended strategies may also include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;weight loss to reach a healthy body weight&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body use its insulin effectively.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have insulin resistance—or are worried about developing it—you might be considering &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-for-metabolic-syndrome-11757613" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplements that claim to help manage this condition&lt;/a&gt;. But are they really effective? When it comes to many of them, the answer is no. Here are five supplements experts say you’re better off avoiding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-st-johns-wort"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. St. John’s Wort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; St. John’s wort is a shrub that’s used as a supplement to treat depression and symptoms of menopause.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it may pose problems for people with insulin resistance. Although no medications are approved to specifically treat insulin resistance, you may be on medications like metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones if you have diabetes. However, combining St. John’s wort with these drugs can be a problem. “It can decrease the efficacy of these medications and lead to higher blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-katz-rd-cdces-9889b863/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lizzy Katz, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes program coordinator at the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same time, diabetes and depression often overlap, says the American Diabetes Association.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’re struggling with your mental health, talk to your health care practitioner about safe treatment for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gymnema is a plant that has been studied for the treatment of diabetes. “However, there is insufficient reliable evidence of this—and even a risk for hypoglycemia,” says Katz. In fact, most of the research on this supplement has been conducted in animals, and even those studies conclude it shouldn’t be recommended for preventing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The National Institutes of Health agrees, adding that the current research on gymnema is lacking, and combined with other supplements, it may be especially dangerous.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, if you are taking insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, you should avoid gymnema due to potential interactions, Katz advises.   
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs is short for branched-chain amino acids.

They are also sold in unnaturally large quantities as supplements advertised for muscle-building and improving results at the gym.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For that reason, many people take them before a workout. This supplement is one that people with insulin resistance should avoid, cautions &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been some links to BCAAs worsening insulin resistance,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yes, exercise is important for treating insulin resistance. But you can reap its benefits without popping a supplement.

But they’re also a popular supplement. If you have insulin resistance, this is one to talk to your provider about before adding it to your routine. “It’s been shown as likely ineffective for managing diabetes, and [there’s] not enough evidence for treatment of diabetic nephropathy,” says Katz. (Diabetic nephropathy is a kidney disease that can result as a complication of diabetes.) Plus, the research on omega-3s and insulin resistance is mixed. While some studies have found omega-3s may help lower fasting blood glucose and protect against insulin resistance, other research suggests they may raise blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are on certain antidiabetes medications like insulin secretagogues, there may also be a risk of low blood sugar, adds Katz.

One review of 16 studies even showed that cinnamon supplementation helped lower fasting blood sugar and insulin resistance in people with diabetes, says Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But before you get too excited, she points out that the studies used in this analysis are severely limited, as they differed in dosage, length of treatment and type of participant. That means we need larger trials and a standardized formula to determine the exact type of cinnamon supplement and protocol that’s actually effective. Until then, skip the cinnamon supplements. But feel free to go ahead and sprinkle some cinnamon onto your food.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the most part, you don’t need supplements if you have insulin resistance. Your health care provider might recommend supplements in certain situations, such as an iron supplement if blood tests reveal you have anemia, says Gomer. But when it comes to insulin resistance specifically, experts recommend focusing on these healthy lifestyle habits instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prioritize Protein&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“Protein will help keep you full,” says Gomer. So, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7821676/protein-nation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;filling up on protein&lt;/a&gt; may also help you avoid overeating. That can help you maintain a healthy body weight, which is one of the best things you can do to manage blood sugar and reduce insulin resistance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile on the Veggies: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your plate is also filled with nonstarchy vegetables. They’re naturally low in carbs, plus their ample fiber slows down carbohydrate absorption and promotes satiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active: &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7915267/best-time-of-day-to-exercise/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Regular exercise is a great component&lt;/a&gt; to focus on because it can improve insulin resistance in the short and long term,” says Katz. That’s because exercise prompts muscles to use up blood sugar as fuel, reducing glucose levels. It can also help cells become more insulin sensitive. Aim for a total of 150 minutes of physical activity per week. You can break that down however you like, whether it’s five 30-minute walks or 15 10-minute movement breaks throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a Healthy Body Weight: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the American Diabetes Association, even modest weight loss can help reduce insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have insulin resistance or simply want to prevent this condition from sneaking up on you, consider connecting with a registered dietitian, especially one who specializes in diabetes care. They can help you develop a weight-loss plan that’s best suited for you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’ve been told you have insulin resistance or are worried about developing it, you may be considering a supplement. However, health experts caution against self-treating with supplements, especially St. John’s wort, gymnema, BCAAs, omega-3 fats and cinnamon. While you may have heard these can help manage insulin resistance, they may be useless or, in some cases, even dangerous. Instead, think lifestyle changes like exercise, a protein- and fiber-rich eating plan and weight loss, if indicated. These all have a solid, proven track record for improving insulin resistance. However, if you’re still concerned, speak with your health care practitioner. They can help you determine if you’re at risk or refer you to a registered dietitian for one-on-one nutrition counseling for better blood sugar.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;BAYFIELD COUNTY — A person in northern Wisconsin has died after contracting a tick-borne virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayfield County Health Department said the patient died from the Powassan virus in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The patient who died was one of three people who have contracted the virus so far this year in Wisconsin, and all three were hospitalized, the state's Department of Health Services said in a June 24 bulletin issued to health care providers and health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spread by the blacklegged tick, commonly referred to as a deer tick, and symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting and generalized weakness, DHS said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The agency said it can also progress to encephalitis — with symptoms like altered mental states, seizures, speech and movement problems, and paralysis — or meningitis — with symptoms like severe headaches, sensitivity to light and neck rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1 out of 10 people with a severe case die, and half of those with a severe case are left with long-term health problems like memory loss and recurring headaches, according to the 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The DHS said risk factors for neurologic disease from the Powassan virus include those with compromised immune systems, as well as children and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy laws, DHS declined to share the age of the patient who died in Bayfield County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no treatment or vaccine for the virus. The DHS urged people to use tick repellent, check for and remove ticks before they can bite and avoid wooded and bushy areas where the virus is found.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cases of Powassan

       in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Minnesota reported 14 cases in 2024 and Wisconsin reported 12 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the number of cases is up is unclear, but there are more deer — the blacklegged tick's preferred host — and more people living near wooded areas with ticks, the News Tribune reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS said ticks become infected with Powassan when they bite and consume the blood of an infected skunk, groundhog, squirrel, mouse, or other rodent. However, the exact source of the virus remains unknown. Ticks can also be born with Powassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was first identified in Wisconsin in 2003. From 2003 to 2024, 67 cases were detected in the state, primarily in the northern region,

Supplements work, yet many communities lack steady access, and cost is sometimes a prohibitive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pseudo-b12-from-spirulina-microalgae"&gt;Pseudo-B12 from Spirulina microalgae&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular Spirulina mainly carries pseudo‑B12, a look‑alike molecule that our cells ignore. The Iceland project used tuned LED lighting to flip the alga’s own genes toward making methylcobalamin, the active form that humans can absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory assays put the new strain’s B12 at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, which is comfortably above the 0.7‑1.5 µg/100 g window quoted for beef in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 98 percent of that total was active B12, not pseudo, ending a long‑standing barrier for microalgae‑based nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call the product “Photosynthetically Controlled Spirulina,” or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33566210/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PCS&lt;/a&gt;. They achieved the upgrade without genetic modification, relying instead on light spectra that boost a native metabolic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-spirulina-with-b-12-vitamins"&gt;Creating Spirulina with B-12 vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pathways ran inside flat‑panel photobioreactor walls that were kept at about 88 °F (31 °C), aerated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032119305398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GEOTHERMAL carbon‑dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and powered by Iceland’s near‑total renewable electric grid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closed system blocks contamination and uses minimal freshwater, an important edge over open ponds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS stayed carbon neutral because every kilowatt came from hydro or geothermal turbines, and harvested biomass trapped the same amount of carbon that the process emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides B12, PCS in Spirulina microalgae delivers roughly 27 grams of protein and 0.03 grams of iron per 100 grams, a profile that tracks or beats lean steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/page-files/Vitamin%20B-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USDA tables&lt;/a&gt; show beef cuts can swing from 0.8 to about 4 micrograms of B12 per 100 grams, depending on the muscle and cooking method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vitamin B12 levels at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, Spirulina is also a comparable source of this essential vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is light in fat, contains no cholesterol, and is naturally salt free, making it easier to incorporate into heart-friendly diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings demonstrate that photosynthetically controlled Spirulina can produce desirable levels of active vitamin B12, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional animal‑source foods,” confirmed Dr. Tzachor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef production averages about 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sharks-may-benefit-from-rising-temperatures-but-not-from-rising-co2/"&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‑equivalent emissions for every kilogram of meat, the highest of any staple protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PCS cultivation is powered by renewables, swapping a kilogram of steak for an equal mass of algae could erase more than 60 kilograms (130 pounds) of greenhouse gas from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper sketches a country‑wide scale‑up: diverting electricity that is now used by heavy industry could let Iceland ship 278 thousand tons of PCS a year, enough active B12 to meet the daily needs of nearly 14 million toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a smaller rollout could plug critical gaps in areas where deficiency and childhood stunting overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS ships as a shelf‑stable powder that blends into flour, beverages, or nutrition bars, trimming cold‑chain costs that hinder meat or milk aid. Because it is an autotroph, it sidesteps the feed, land, and water burdens that shadow livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-b12-rich-spirulina-and-food-policy"&gt;B12-rich Spirulina and food policy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS could also shift how governments approach &lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;ood security and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/malnutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Because the production system is modular and closed-loop, it can be deployed in regions with poor soil, unreliable rainfall, or limited farmland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opens the door to building local microalgae facilities in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/which-dietary-changes-are-best-for-cancer-prevention/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; deficiency is most severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If validated at scale, PCS could also influence agricultural subsidies and international food aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations might begin to classify Spirulina as a strategic crop, eligible for public investment or included in procurement plans for schools, hospitals, and humanitarian agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would mark a rare crossover between biotech innovation and public nutrition policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical teams still have to confirm how well humans absorb the algae‑bound &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; compared with pills or steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are being designed to track blood markers, nerve function, and taste acceptance across a two‑year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers also need to soften PCS’s distinctive color and aroma for picky eaters, especially children.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anal cancer is on the rise, with specialist Dr. Evan Goldstein sharing a little-known warning sign that can increase the risk, which he dubs a 'silent disease'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nine out of 10 HPV infections go away on their own,&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anal-cancer#:~:text=Anal%20Cancer%20Causes&amp;amp;text=HPV%20is%20the%20most%20common,cause%20genital%20and%20anal%20warts."&gt; Johns Hopkins notes&lt;/a&gt; if the infection becomes persistent or more severe due to a weakened immune system, HPV can cause cancers later in life, including anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of developing anal cancer is around one in 500, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/anal-cancer.html"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/a&gt; The site noted that this number was particularly high among white and Hispanic women over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer symptoms can be similar to those of hemorrhoids and anal fissures, sometimes making it harder to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms are bleeding from the anus, itching and pain, as well small lumps around and inside your bottom and a discharge of mucus and inconsistent stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The idea is to catch this early with early detection anal pap smears and full anoscopy with an appropriate anal practitioner,' Dr. Goldstein explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we talk about anal health and standardize yearly evaluations, similar to genecology appointments, the better all of us will be,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldstein often shares information about anal health, revealing a critical mistake people are making after using the toilet, explaining it could lead to serious health issues over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leading proctologist says 'traditional wiping' with toilet paper is causing unnecessary damage and is even more concerned about the popularity of using wet wipes to complete the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Goldstein described anal warts as 'painful and itchy' and said they can 'lead to bleeding' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong"&gt;HuffPost for Am I Doing It Wrong?&lt;/a&gt; Dr Goldstein explained that the skin around the anus is sensitive, and wiping with toilet paper can easily lead to irritation, small tears, and long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a problem that he sees far too often in his clinic, and it's only getting worse as more people rely on wet wipes for a 'cleaner' finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They are so terrible - not only for the environment, but for your hole,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so many companies out there throwing wipes and I think they should all be banned. I see 90 people a week [in my office], and I would say one-third of all the people coming through are coming in from wet wipe-induced issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Goldstein, wet wipes are soaked in chemicals which can disrupt the microbiome of the area, which can lead to bacterial infections and painful skin conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting rid of your persistent fat layers, while gaining girth down under. That's a contemporary equivalent to the fabled fountain of youth, and a special class of weight loss drugs that leverage the GLP-1 hormone - such as Novo Nordisk's Wegovy or Eli Lilly's &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/eli-lilly-and-company-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-is-much-more-effective-than-novo-nordisk/"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; - are now being billed as the conduits for these seemingly miraculous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GLP-1 hormone suppresses hunger and regulates the production of insulin and glucose. After a meal, this hormone raises the level of insulin, which decreases blood glucose levels. Simultaneously, it reduces the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine, creating a feeling of fullness and satiation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's diabetes-geared Ozempic and obesity-focused Wegovy mimic this process by using the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, which binds to the GLP-1 hormone receptor, triggering the hormone in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Diabetes.co.uk, the average penile length in the United Kingdom has increased by 0.46 inches between 2022 and 2024, increasing from 5.17 inches to 5.63 inches over the period. Incidentally, this timeframe also coincides with the launch of Ozempic/Wegovy in the UK and the drug's subsequent rip-roaring popularity, with many A-class celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, jumping onto the proverbial bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reported increase in penile length is also corroborated by several social media anecdotes &lt;a href="https://www.uniladtech.com/science/news/doctor-explains-ozempic-penis-phenomenon-side-effect-004987-20250623"&gt;gathered&lt;/a&gt; by Unilad Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what might be causing male packages to, um, flourish so to say? Well, some speculate that better blood flow to the male nether regions might be responsible for the apparent elongation in penile length. Others, including Dr Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, theorize that this phenomenon might simply be a function of fat removal in the areas adjoining the penis, which would make a given male appendage appear longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic/Wegovy can cause a host of side effects, including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/update-fdas-ongoing-evaluation-reports-suicidal-thoughts-or-actions-patients-taking-certain-type"&gt;possible suicidal ideation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one should never take these drugs without a formal medical recommendation. For those already on GLP-1 drugs though, penile bragging rights might be a hefty ancillary benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

To a more complicated question, there’s a more complicated answer, but an answer nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at MegaFood; and &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tamar Samuels, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we break down the main types of vitamins you might take in supplement form, and the ideal times to take them, depending on their qualities and how they support your health. After all, there are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6099991/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 main vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13 main vitamins&lt;/a&gt; that your body needs to work, and they all act a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best time to take vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best time to take vitamins really depends on the type of vitamin you’re taking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at MegaFood. Different nutrients are absorbed better at specific times of day. “For example, water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B vitamins can be taken any time of the day, as long as it works for you, but they’re often best absorbed on an empty stomach,” she continues. “On the other hand, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are better taken with a meal that contains healthy fats to help with absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vitamins have immediate effects that make them better suited for morning or night. For example, vitamin B12 (often an ingredient in energy drinks) is usually better taken in the morning, “because it plays a key role in energy production and may help reduce feelings of fatigue,” says Manaker. “On the other hand, magnesium is commonly taken in the evening as it has a calming effect on the body, helping to relax muscles and support a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the best time to take your vitamins is whenever you can remember to take them consistently, adds &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tamar Samuels, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of vitamins and when to take them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing and how you take vitamins can vary depending on whether they are water-soluble or fat-soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins, including &lt;strong&gt;vitamins A, D, E, and K&lt;/strong&gt;, rely on fat to absorb properly, “which is why pairing them with a meal containing healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, or olive oil, can be beneficial,” says Manaker. These vitamins are also stored in your body after absorption, which allows you to use them gradually over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to both Manaker and Samuels, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; plays important roles in vision, skin, and immune health; &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20506205/12-foods-high-in-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; contributes to bone, immune, and hormone health; vitamin E is an antioxidant that promotes anti-inflammation and skin repair; and vitamin K works against blood clotting and also promotes bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water-soluble vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble vitamins like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64161408/best-time-to-take-vitamin-b/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:B vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin C &lt;/strong&gt;dissolve in water and are absorbed quickly, explains Manaker. “Your body doesn’t store them in large amounts, and you excrete what you don’t need through urine,” she says. “This means you need to replenish water-soluble vitamins regularly in your diet.” It’s a good idea to take water-soluble vitamins with food or a glass of water in the mornings, she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamins C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamins C&lt;/a&gt;, B6, B12, folate, and biotin are are crucial for energy production, immune function, nerve health, metabolism, and maintaining healthy skin and cells, say Manaker and Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Multi-vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-vitamins are daily supplements formulated to contain all the vitamins your body needs in one daily capsule or gummy. “The best time to take a multi-vitamin really depends on your routine, but consistency is key,” says Manaker. “Some people prefer taking them in the morning with breakfast to establish a habit. Others might take them in the evening if it’s easier to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, if yours contains energizing vitamins like B12, mornings might be a better choice, Manaker adds. Many people take theirs with a meal to avoid an upset stomach. “If you take iron or magnesium in your multivitamin, avoid pairing it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or cheese), which can compete for absorption,” recommends Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take vitamins with food?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins (like A, D, E, and K) are absorbed better when taken with a meal that includes healthy fats. However, water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) don’t require fat for absorption and can sometimes be taken on an empty stomach. “That said, taking vitamins with food generally helps reduce the chance of any stomach discomfort,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take vitamins, period?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always consult your doctor before changing your routine. As with any supplement, you should only be taking vitamins if you’ve been diagnosed with a deficiency. Otherwise, you can make sure you’re getting the right balance of them through a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and lean proteins (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting nutrients from food is best because whole foods provide fiber, phytonutrients, and other compounds that supplements can’t replicate,” says Manaker. “However, vitamins can be a smart option for people with specific nutrient deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or increased nutrient needs (like during pregnancy). Lab work, guidance from a dietitian, or monitoring your overall wellness can help identify if supplements could support your health goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Manaker and Samuels recommend looking for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency, and avoiding falling for social media trends that may encourage you to stray from your prescribed regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFA0eXQ0ZnBjeE8xc05ibWZ5Z1dDR3NxcmdmWmx1XzRuRDdRclRCNzlLMVljYm0wN05ncHozcEhzV3phRGZEc0x6RUtPTEpaeTE0OG0wSDBVcGdybEZ1MVV1cWxQTHBHQjZhdFFzVHgwV2Npdw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养学家的说法，最好的抗炎食品- AOL.com | The Best Anti-Inflammatory Food, According to a Nutritionist - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5HUWFNOVNoUjBxbGNuU3Z5QXFPaFlUTmRGcHFfdktjVzlMSmNTakRZcTF0WnhJVk9COGt5empJTF9Mc1J1ZDV5MnV3dUxPQ0tORl91UjhIVnhtMy1ZRXVjQjZDNDFvUHBoUVNoN1NWT0RhaFZUWDVNNnJveng?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Nut Helps Lower Inflammation Naturally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Eva Katalin Kondoros - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of chatter about inflammation over the past few years.

Beyond omega-3s and urolithins, walnuts also contain polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9609811/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may combat oxidative stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may combat oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, which often contributes to chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While snacking on walnuts has its benefits, if you’re truly looking to make some serious strides towards lowering inflammation, you’ll want to adjust your eating patterns by opting for an &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a39840927/what-is-anti-inflammatory-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;. The diet involves “a pattern of eating focused on incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods that support your body’s natural defenses,” according to Manaker. “This dietary pattern is about abundance—more colorful plants, more healthy fats, and fewer ultra-processed, sugary, and fried foods.” Think: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish rich in omega-3s, such as salmon and mackerel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out more about combatting inflammation through food in &lt;a href="https://shop.prevention.com/prevention-28day-antiinflammatory-diet-1725915612854/p" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention’s 28-day Anti-inflammatory Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevention’s&lt;/em&gt; 28-day Anti-inflammatory Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5HUWFNOVNoUjBxbGNuU3Z5QXFPaFlUTmRGcHFfdktjVzlMSmNTakRZcTF0WnhJVk9COGt5empJTF9Mc1J1ZDV5MnV3dUxPQ0tORl91UjhIVnhtMy1ZRXVjQjZDNDFvUHBoUVNoN1NWT0RhaFZUWDVNNnJveng</guid></item><item><title>需要注意的低睾酮症状以及如何处理- GQ | The Low-Testosterone Symptoms to Look Out for—and How to Handle Them - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE50NDhnenRQbGVpN1E2OVQ3dEpnX2E3N1M4b05peFlWdGJLcEJoN0x4akpGUm00d0xfc2hqT203dkdTUDdOMXp0UjY0MEMzTDcwUFJ2bTRJcTdrZjFId2Q4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This age-based decline in testosterone is distinct from more cut-and-dry medical conditions, like Kleinfelder syndrome, where men are born with an extra X chromosome. These medical conditions are often treated with TRT; how far the therapy is applicable to others who have low testosterone symptoms is more controversial. Healthy men generally only have a “slight decline” in testosterone levels as they age, says Kelly, and only when they’re in their 70s and 80s. Testosterone levels declining earlier and more severely usually happens because of other health issues, like inflammation, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Things in your diet like &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/a-simple-rule-for-a-better-diet"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in some plastic packaging can affect testosterone levels too. The important thing is your average level, Kelly stresses, as it changes throughout the day and even between seasons. It’s true that over-exercising can cause your testosterone levels to drop, he says, “but it’s a transient thing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, Kelly thinks the crucial thing for keeping your testosterone levels up is just a healthy lifestyle: &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-start-working-out"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/3-simple-rules-for-a-better-diet"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-sleep-better-according-to-sleep-experts"&gt;sleeping well&lt;/a&gt;. In short, all the things we know we should be doing. An exception where TRT “might be a really useful and beneficial therapy for some men” is to help break the cycle of poor health— because if you’re obese, “and then that lowers your testosterone, your lower testosterone contributes to you not processing sugar and fat as well, so you become more obese.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster is more bullish about the benefits of TRT. He views the testosterone decline in middle-aged men as akin to menopause in women, and something that lifestyle changes will help, but can’t fix. “You can eat all the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and selenium [supplements] you want,” he says, “but it’s not going to make your testicles the same as they were 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites—as Kelly does—studies that link low testosterone in men to an increased risk of mortality. A healthier lifestyle might push you up to the lower end of what the NHS considers a “normal” testosterone level—about eight nanomoles per litre—but “all those risks associated with your health aren’t going to suddenly resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s very wary, though, about prescribing TRT to younger men under 30 who don’t have an obvious medical condition. Your natural testosterone levels “keep going higher each year to the age of 30ish,” he says. “If we start disrupting this when you’re 22, how do I know I’m not causing damage for when you’re 40, 50, 60?” He finds the trend of under-30s getting on TRT, especially in the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; world, absolutely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession in some corners of the internet with maximizing your testosterone can lead to some weird habits. On Reddit’s &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/"}' href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated testosterone forum&lt;/a&gt;, one user offers a unique prescription: “Carnivore diet. Semen retention (no porn). Heavy lifting. Lots of sunlight exposure… especially on the testicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kelly tells me, it’s a minefield out there. Abstaining from masturbation has been proved to raised testosterone only among “a handful of people”—and that has to be weighed against the much clearer benefits of regular orgasm. If you’re concerned about low testosterone, d&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/joe-holder-exercise-snack-short-workout"&gt;o get in shape&lt;/a&gt; and get your diet sorted, and possibly, depending on your age, consider TRT. And try to tune out all the strange advice you come across online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/"&gt;British GQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE50NDhnenRQbGVpN1E2OVQ3dEpnX2E3N1M4b05peFlWdGJLcEJoN0x4akpGUm00d0xfc2hqT203dkdTUDdOMXp0UjY0MEMzTDcwUFJ2bTRJcTdrZjFId2Q4</guid></item><item><title>癌症幸存者Matt教练希望其他年轻人为自己的健康负责- WRAL.com | Coach Matt, a cancer survivor, wants other young men to take responsibility for their health - WRAL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTFA1SlhrbFBOalVIUzhGNjV2ZzVYbU85UjFXdEw3a2F2bVVLX1BpeS1JbWRUeHhEcU42WE14WE0xa1ZlLVVrLV9MTXZRSmpWdXU3S3NfMXJPeFZWLXFfMTBreVZXY0VTRXlrRVRZWUp2Rl80VHM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;Matt Cross has a life mission: to train young men to become leaders. Mostly he does that through example. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross is a youth hockey coach, raised in Toronto and a Raleigh transplant. “As an athlete, I'm always trying to encourage and teach my athletes to be courageous and be brave and to be responsible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After a cancer diagnosis at age 36, he’s added another element to that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Because I work with a lot of families and a lot of young people, it was very easy for me to decide that there was a reason why I was going through this,” he says. “It was very easy for me to look at this as an opportunity to make my family and friends proud and to show young people what you do when you have a really difficult obstacle in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was a visit from his father that led Cross to face that obstacle: Testicular cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His father was having heart problems and trying to understand what was going on. So Cross offered to wear an Apple Watch so they could compare EKG readings. When Cross got an abnormal reading, he promised his dad he’d check with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross had another question ready for that appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While I was getting my physical, I said, ‘Hey, you know, why don't you check out this lump,’” he recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I had a lump on my testicle that was there for a number of months, and – typical guy – I figured I'd go to the doctor when I had a real reason to go to the doctor,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His dad and the abnormal EKG provided that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The answer came on Christmas Day 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I was stage 2B. Stage 2B means that the cancer originated in the testicle,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Testicular cancer is the number one most common cancer for men ages 15 to 35. The standard treatment is removal of the testical that contains the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As a coach, Cross understood being in the fight, but he was looking for a win. Aware of the tradition of cancer survivors ringing a bell to signify that they had reached remission, Cross was disappointed when at first he didn’t see a bell at his doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He endured two surgeries and three cycles of chemotherapy, a total of 15 full days of infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The story goes, when I came in for my very last day of treatment, they had installed a bell,” he says. “So I was able to have a celebration and ring it.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“As a cancer patient and survivor, you learn to celebrate all the wins, the small ones, the big ones,” Cross says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s that message he’s shared with his players and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Cancer is all sorts of life lessons kind of thrown at you all at once,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“For a lot of people, it's devastating, and you're sick and you're literally just trying to survive. But if you can somehow get to that place where you're learning and you're growing and you're helping other people, I really think that's the way that you should try to go.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The most amazing thing that ever happened to me was getting sick. It's nuts. No pun intended.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross was surrounded by support from the hockey community throughout his fight.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He recalls, “That looked like emails, phone calls, texts, food gift cards, a GoFundMe. A lot of the local hockey teams taped their sticks purple and put ribbons on their jerseys.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That support notched up the pressure for Cross to get well. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was really a big part of my fight; I can't let these people down,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In remission for five years, Cross has returned to his mission of modeling leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A year to the day after his diagnosis, Cross launched the Raleigh Testicular Cancer Foundation. The goal is specifically to raise awareness and to educate about testicular cancer, and generally to get men to pay attention to their own health. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“Our slogan for our charity is Check Your Acorns. That's kind of like a clever, cute way to encourage men and young people to perform self checks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We're trying to tear down stigmas so that men book that doctor's appointment and that annual physical.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross points to the widespread acceptance and awareness of the need for self-exams for breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Men need that extra nudge, he says, to understand the risks of ignoring their bodies’ warning signs. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It's not about being masculine and being strong,” he says, “it's about saving your life, potentially. The cure rates for cancer when you find them in stage one are significantly higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt; "Diagnosis: Young. The New Face of Cancer in NC" is the latest investigative documentary from the WRAL Doc unit, exploring the alarming trend of cancer striking younger adults in North Carolina and across the nation. The documentary follows three North Carolinians in their 20s and 30s who never expected a cancer diagnosis so early in life. Behind every personal story is the big question: Why is this happening?  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA-Approved Sleeping Pill Slows Alzheimer's Tangles in Pre-Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165966" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A study by Queen Mary University of London found drinking a cup of beetroot juice each day could significantly lower the blood pressure of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/professor-says-underrated-powerhouse-food-31935659" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;people suffering from hypertension.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study saw patients who suffer from high blood pressure drink a 250ml glass of purple juice every day, by the end of the timeframe the study found a significant reduction into that of a "normal range".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the study, the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2015/january/beetroot-and-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation added&lt;/a&gt;: "This study, involving 64 volunteers, provides the first evidence of a long-lasting reduction in blood pressure by supplementing the diet with nitrates in patients with high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The level of reduction was similar to that from some forms of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/consultant-cardiologist-says-small-step-31924230" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;blood pressure medication&lt;/a&gt;. No adverse side effects were observed in people taking the daily dose of nitrates, in the form of beetroot juice."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beetroot isn't the only vegetable high in nitrates, leafy green such as spinach, kale and lettuce as well as carrots, celery, and leeks can all be a great way of including the compound in your diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31117833" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Amrita Ahluwalia, who led the research, added: “This research has proven that a daily inorganic nitrate dose can be as effective as medical intervention in reducing blood pressure and the best part is we can get it from beetroot and other leafy green vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For those looking to work dietary nitrate into their daily diets, the trick is not to boil the vegetables – as dietary nitrate is water soluble – but steaming, roasting or drinking in a juice all has a positive effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of using a natural product instead of medication may be appealing to many, but both the charity and the researcher stressed that more research with a much larger sample size needs to be done before it is used as an official solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPbW1PZmh2TjJ4bWRZb1JrTXRod0V0dDgwN0hyTFZBVy1ielQ4OGxsTnI1VGJHVjRjdm1JTmJ0M254bDdfUWkzQlNjaEcwM2VRa2huRUxsOHZIdHpaaUJOdzJZTXpxdWVWcXIyVVU3Um1jbGY1X3M1WTFIcHF1TnBjR0VJanA</guid></item><item><title>疏通动脉的胆固醇超级食物“优于阿司匹林”医生说- Daily Express | Cholesterol superfood that unclogs arteries is 'better than aspirin' doctor says - Daily Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix hR new-style"&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" alt="Female hands with pills" title="Female hands with pills"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The superfood has been shown to work well at keeping arteries clear, similarly to aspirin &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health expert has identified a specific superfood that he claims clears arteries "better than aspirin".

It’s the body's natural morning changes like higher blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with an enhanced chance of clotting, that amplify the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his video titled: "#1 Best

can lead to worrying plaque formation in our arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevated blood pressure, notorious for its damaging effect on artery walls, creates a fertile ground for further plaque buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking pushes toxins into the bloodstream, injuring artery walls and fuelling inflammation, which, in turn, encourages plaque to form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes' impact on blood vessel health is profound, with high sugar levels increasing the danger of plaque accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity adds fuel to the fire, sparking high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes—all of which contribute to the menace of clogged arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sedentary lifestyle can trigger a cascade of issues, including weight gain and increased cholesterol and blood pressure, all enemy agents in the fight against arterial health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your immediate family members have been diagnosed with heart disease, you may be at a higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you age, the probability of developing atherosclerosis increases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent stress can trigger inflammation, which can exacerbate plaque

rel="nofollow"&gt;Aspirin can help with clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't directly treat the blockage. It's an antiplatelet medication that prevents blood clots from forming in narrowed arteries, which could lead to heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin doesn't eliminate the plaque causing the blockages. Instead, it helps manage the risk of complications resulting from these blockages. Doctors often recommend aspirin for people who already have heart disease or are at high risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, particularly after undergoing procedures like angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, aspirin isn't suitable for everyone, especially those without a history of heart disease or those at an increased risk of bleeding. It's crucial to seek advice from a healthcare professional before starting aspirin therapy, as it can cause side effects such as stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" alt="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" title="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;EPA not only suppresses atherosclerotic development but also stabilises atherosclerotic plaque &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whatsapp-group "&gt; &lt;strong class="wapp-head"&gt; Get top stories from The Express sent straight to your phone &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="wapp-btn" href="https://www.express.co.uk/whatsapp-group-web/11?utm_source=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_content=whatsapp-group-signup-in-article"&gt;Join us on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wapp-inf"&gt;Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

It can also positively influence your mood by reducing cortisol and adrenaline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg cites salmon, mackerel, fatty fish, and fish oil as some of the best sources of EPA. However, he suggests there's an even superior source. "Cod liver oil or cod liver is the best food to unclog your arteries naturally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation highlights oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies as excellent sources of EPA. Cod liver oil, oysters, and certain white fish and shellfish also contain EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based alternatives like flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts provide ALA, which the body can convert into EPA, albeit not as efficiently as obtaining EPA directly from fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" alt="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" title="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;Blocked arteries put you at high risk of various medical conditions &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg adds: "Along with EPA, cod liver oil contains vitamins A and D. The active form of vitamin A, retinol, aids in repairing the body's internal tissues. It's also a potent anti-inflammatory and can help decrease atherosclerotic plaque."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2015 animal study titled: "Aspirin enhances protective effect of fish oil against thrombosis and injury‐induced vascular remodelling," notes: "Although aspirin is commonly used to prevent ischaemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, many patients fail to respond to aspirin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dietary fish oil (FO), containing ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has anti‐inflammatory and cardio‐protective properties, such as lowering cholesterol and modulating platelet activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3331709/#:~:text=These%20data%20suggest%20that%20EPA,inflammation%20and%20angiogenesis%20than%20aspirin." rel="nofollow"&gt;Another study concludes that EPA can be more beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, stating: "EPA+DHA has more pronounced down-regulatory effects on inflammation and angiogenesis than aspirin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recent studies indicate optimistic outcomes, the efficacy of omega 3 has garnered varying results, thereby necessitating more research. Some authorities argue that omega 3 hasn't yet matched aspirin's effectiveness, and they caution against discontinuing aspirin without the go-ahead from your cardiologist or alternate recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg added to the discussion, emphasising vitamin D's merit based on research: "&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021002777" rel="nofollow"&gt;In one study&lt;/a&gt;, out of 1000 compounds, vitamin D was the most effective at preventing damage to the internal layer of the arteries. Vitamin D increases nitric oxide and the stiffness of the arteries. It's a potent anti-inflammatory, stabilises plaque, prevents rupture, and decreases arterial calcification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) fish oil is generally deemed harmless for the majority when ingested in recommended doses. Nonetheless, it's crucial to be mindful of potential adverse effects and drug interactions, especially concerning certain medications or pre-existing medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consulting your healthcare provider before starting fish oil supplements is critical to confirm their safety and appropriateness for you, particularly if you have any health complications or are under medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>全科医生分享了一个危险信号，这意味着一个斑点可能是皮肤癌-每日快报 | GP shares one red flag that means a spot could be skin cancer - Daily Express</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNb2xZYkR3RG1GYjZ0Y3JubTgyM1FqT3REN3NPNnNENW5ObGlkZDB3RXA1aGYxYy1XZjNZeThnemxSQzQzNVd5ODA4T1ZramxURnpuTVdNWllUZHNTd2tZVlluS1RBNzBrclRSdm1sVjRmWEZMUnJneUl6Zl80cmJ1eTltVmN5V0g0UVRtQ1VNaC1SS20tcXfSAZsBQVVfeXFMT0ZLbjRjTHI5TDdhQUdCN09yMzNVV0VpdHJYTVlKMVpWZE10ckR2SE53czVUVzFIRGM4aElMM2s0YUFmZENTTE85bkcyaHU1R1h4czFhb1RwSTBTZ1ZXenBoNGNLTWVqOGg4RXdvb196dF9RMjV1cFA2TWVsZ2oxRk9ORENmalNrSkF6Qk1ieVhrdmRQVnVTdURXUW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the irritation of the summer months, heat, sun, creams and lotions many of us may be waking up to more pimples. More often than not, spots are a result of hormonal fluctuations, excess oil, or other relatively harmless factors. However, there are instances where a pimple can be a warning sign of something &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/skin-cancer"&gt;far more serious.&lt;/a&gt; A doctor has revealed that what appears to be a run-of-the-mill spot on the face could be an early indication of a &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/2073773/correct-way-apply-sunscreen"&gt;deadly skin cancer.&lt;/a&gt; His main message is to get it checked if in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking to &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/tiktok" data-link-tracking="InArticle|AutoLink"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drmichaelsays/video/7374725760390565137?lang=en%20(already%20approved)" rel="nofollow"&gt;Doctor Michael Mrozinski&lt;/a&gt; shed light on basal cell skin cancer, a type of skin cancer that commonly develops on sun-exposed areas, such as the face. Commenting on another user's video about a spot near their nose, he said: "So that right there is a perfect example of what an early basal cell skin &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/uk/2067910/alarming-rise-rare-cancer-thats"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; looks like."

He added: "A lot of the time people coming in to see me haven't even realised it could be something like a skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I've had times where I've said to somebody, what's that on your face and they will see as a pimple, and I'll say, 'How long has it been there for,' and they'll say, 'Six months,' and I'll say, 'Do you think it's normal for a pimple to be hanging around after six months?'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that men often mistake the spot for a shaving cut. Dr Michael concluded that if you notice a pimple that isn't going away you should consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-in-line-first-slot" class="ad-container" data-tb-non-consent="taboola-mid-article-express" data-tb-mode="thumbnails-mid" data-tb-placement="Mid Article Express" data-tb-target-type="mix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if you've had a lot of sun exposure in your lifetime and you've got a pimple, that's not going away, let somebody look at it down a dermascope, which is a type of microscope that we have in the office," he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because if you catch these things early, we can actually use some creams, chemotherapy creams to get rid of them without having to cut something off of your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if it's too far gone, we're going to have to excise them, you may end up with a scar on your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So please be vigilant when checking your skin and always wear your sunscreen, we know that they reduce the risks of these."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in the US, there are a number of indicators of basal cell carcinoma.

Different nutrients are absorbed better at specific times of day. “For example, water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B vitamins can be taken any time of the day, as long as it works for you, but they’re often best absorbed on an empty stomach,” she continues. “On the other hand, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are better taken with a meal that contains healthy fats to help with absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some vitamins have immediate effects that make them better suited for morning or night. For example, vitamin B12 (often an ingredient in energy drinks) is usually better taken in the morning, “because it plays a key role in energy production and may help reduce feelings of fatigue,” says Manaker. “On the other hand, magnesium is commonly taken in the evening as it has a calming effect on the body, helping to relax muscles and support a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Most importantly, the best time to take your vitamins is whenever you can remember to take them consistently, adds &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1750880351267000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1odaIZhFbu4osF8GqMNpf8" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tamar Samuels, R.D." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="10" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Types of vitamins and when to take them" data-anchor-id="types-of-vitamins-and-when-to-take-them" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Types of vitamins and when to take them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The timing and how you take vitamins can vary depending on whether they are water-soluble or fat-soluble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins, including &lt;strong data-node-id="13.1"&gt;vitamins A, D, E, and K&lt;/strong&gt;, rely on fat to absorb properly, “which is why pairing them with a meal containing healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, or olive oil, can be beneficial,” says Manaker.

Others might take them in the evening if it’s easier to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, if yours contains energizing vitamins like B12, mornings might be a better choice, Manaker adds.  Many people take theirs with a meal to avoid an upset stomach. “If you take iron or magnesium in your multivitamin, avoid pairing it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or cheese), which can compete for absorption,” recommends Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="23" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins with food?

However, water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) don’t require fat for absorption and can sometimes be taken on an empty stomach. “That said, taking vitamins with food generally helps reduce the chance of any stomach discomfort,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="25" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins, period?

As with any supplement, you should only be taking vitamins if you’ve been diagnosed with a deficiency. Otherwise, you can make sure you’re getting the right balance of them through a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and lean proteins (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean diet" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Getting nutrients from food is best because whole foods provide fiber, phytonutrients, and other compounds that supplements can’t replicate,” says Manaker. “However, vitamins can be a smart option for people with specific nutrient deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or increased nutrient needs (like during pregnancy). Lab work, guidance from a dietitian, or monitoring your overall wellness can help identify if supplements could support your health goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both Manaker and Samuels recommend looking for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency, and avoiding falling for social media trends that may encourage you to stray from your prescribed regimen.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

These sulfated glycosaminoglycans (or GAGs) allow cancer cells to fortify their cell membranes with vitamin E and avoid a form of cell death called ferroptosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Though clinical applications are still a ways off, the study underscores how understanding cancer’s metabolism could open new doors for treatment, said &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/research/membership/profile.html?id=85100cc1862ddee04224b2859bb3b78d" rel=""&gt;Dr. Shad Thaxton&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of urology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I think this paper and others in the field [emphasize] the appreciation for ferroptosis as a mechanism to kill cancer cells — that mechanism of cell death is so intimately intertwined with cell metabolism,” Thaxton said. “I think what’s interesting for people is that metabolism has a really big impact on the potential vulnerability of cancer cells to specific therapies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;Building blocks with functional perks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40164-024-00482-x" target="_self" rel="" title="https://ehoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40164-024-00482-x"&gt;Cancers rewire their metabolism&lt;/a&gt; in ways that support their growing horde of destructive cells. Some of this rewiring involves producing energy from glucose and acquiring cellular building blocks such as nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Amassing cellular building blocks is especially crucial since a tumor’s uncontrolled growth lends to it creating a hostile microenvironment where there aren’t enough nutrients and other resources, said &lt;a href="https://cri.utsw.edu/faculty/javier-garcia-bermudez/" rel=""&gt;Javier Garcia-Bermudez&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the Children’s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern, who led the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Lipids are essential for a tumor to grow and progress. The plasma membrane of each cell is a bilayer of lipids; as cancer cells swell in number, they have to source lipids from their immediate environment or make their own to maintain their plasma membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/IZGDQTOOPJBKZGSGDIYZFGKHCM.jpg?auth=2fc9feb8c12ad41eb526b65119cbd410bf1480cb63fb2c6f4cb6b65834f48d40&amp;amp;width=430&amp;amp;quality=80 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/IZGDQTOOPJBKZGSGDIYZFGKHCM.jpg?auth=2fc9feb8c12ad41eb526b65119cbd410bf1480cb63fb2c6f4cb6b65834f48d40&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/IZGDQTOOPJBKZGSGDIYZFGKHCM.jpg?auth=2fc9feb8c12ad41eb526b65119cbd410bf1480cb63fb2c6f4cb6b65834f48d40&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="From left to right, the researchers include co-first author Lingjie Sang, a postdoctoral..."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;From left to right, the researchers include co-first author Lingjie Sang, a postdoctoral fellow; senior author Javier Garcia-Bermudez, assistant professor in Children's Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern; and co-first author Dylan Calhoon, a graduate student researcher.&lt;span class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P pl-1"&gt;(Children's Research Institute)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Garcia-Bermudez said that was the prevailing theory as to why lipids are so important to cancer. Emerging research has since discovered that lipids may offer cancer cells more functional perks. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/36468-cancer-cells-may-be-using-lipids-to-hide-from-the-immune-system/" rel=""&gt;September 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that cancer cells use lipids called sphingolipids to go into stealth mode, evading detection and destruction by the immune system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Studies have also found lipids are somehow involved in ferroptosis, a type of cell death &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422007085" rel=""&gt;discovered in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378608022000320" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378608022000320"&gt;A portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; of “ferrous,” the Latin word for iron, and apoptosis, the scientific word for programmed cell death, ferroptosis happens when a buildup of toxic molecules called oxidants and iron overwhelms a cell, causing it to essentially rust from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Oxidants damage the lipids that are forming the membranes [of] a cell,” Garcia-Bermudez said. “What’s interesting is that cancer cells tend to produce more oxidants than normal cells,” he added, noting that there’s been interest in understanding why some cancers are more susceptible to this type of damage and in using ferroptosis to kill cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;Cut the GAGs, kill the cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The crafty masters of survival that they are, cancer cells have devised ways to dodge ferroptosis. Unraveling the reason why put Garcia-Bermudez and his lab on a four-year journey of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;One of the researchers’ first findings, after screening 200 metabolic genes linked to cancer, was that an enzyme called glutathione peroxidase 4 was active in tumors. This wasn’t a new discovery: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0891584918315934" rel=""&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; this enzyme, which can stop lipids from degrading, plays a pivotal role in controlling ferroptosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;When glutathione peroxidase 4 was erased from a cancer cell’s genome, the tumor would die — unless it was given a drug blocking ferroptosis or fed lipoproteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“That was a clue that lipoproteins were somehow related to ferroptosis,” said &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/doctors/ralph-deberardinis/" rel=""&gt;Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis&lt;/a&gt;, director of UT Southwestern Medical Center’s Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, who coauthored the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In a battery of experiments that included depriving cancer cells in petri dishes of lipoproteins and exposing them to different antioxidants, the full picture began to be unveiled. Cancer cells were intercepting lipoproteins, particularly those bearing vitamin E — a fat-soluble antioxidant — from their surrounding environment. Like a fisherman with a fishing line, cancer cells accomplished this not with the usual reels used to catch lipoproteins but with long, flowy sugar chains called sulfated glycosaminoglycans (or GAGs). These molecules are attached to a cancer cell surface through another molecule called a proteoglycan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;When the scientists blocked the biochemical pathway responsible for manufacturing GAGs, this limited a lab-grown cancer cell’s access to vitamin E and made it more vulnerable to ferroptosis. In mice grafted with cancer cells, cutting off the pathway slowed tumor growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LTIIJVKO3NHT7HSWDU7FZLVH3Y.jpg?auth=a93b39b88571e24418f5c867008b41ed9f599f203657569a102678126f0abd8f&amp;amp;width=430&amp;amp;quality=80 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LTIIJVKO3NHT7HSWDU7FZLVH3Y.jpg?auth=a93b39b88571e24418f5c867008b41ed9f599f203657569a102678126f0abd8f&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LTIIJVKO3NHT7HSWDU7FZLVH3Y.jpg?auth=a93b39b88571e24418f5c867008b41ed9f599f203657569a102678126f0abd8f&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis is the director of UT Southwestern Medical Center's Eugene McDermott..."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis is the director of UT Southwestern Medical Center's Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development and coauthor of the study.&lt;span class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P pl-1"&gt;(Mei-Chun Jau)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The researchers also examined 20 tumors donated by patients with clear cell renal carcinoma, the most common type of kidney cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.kidneycancer.org/essentials/fast-facts/" rel=""&gt;affecting over 640,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. These tumors had higher levels of GAGs and vitamin E — about 15 times more of the latter — compared to normal kidney tissue. Disrupting the biochemical pathway producing GAGs prevented kidney cancer cells from devouring vitamin E-laden lipoproteins, dying by the iron hand of ferroptosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;Future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Garcia-Bermudez and DeBerardinis caution that there is much more research to be done before their study’s findings have any clinical application for treating cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We know that GAGS are on the surface, they speak to the lipoproteins and they affect the uptake of lipoproteins,” Garcia-Bermudez said. “But how mechanistically this happens, especially in the cancer cell, hasn’t been shown before … If we understand how this works and we find molecular targets that maybe we can treat with drugs and block, then we have a way to specifically deplete vitamin E in the tumor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;DeBerardinis said the research does not suggest any association between dietary vitamin E and cancer risk, or how vitamin E levels correlate with cancer patient outcomes. Figuring out those possible connections would be points for future study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the short term, DeBerardinis said, these findings could be used to investigate whether tumors with higher levels of glycosaminoglycans or stored vitamin E are linked to patient outcomes, such as survival rates or how well they respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Thaxton said there are currently no federally approved cancer treatments that incite ferroptosis. His lab at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine is conducting research into synthetic lipoproteins devoid of any lipid passengers — a Trojan horse without  soldiers hiding inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The cancer cells expect to get the lipoproteins with fats like cholesterol and vitamin E, Thaxton said, but “they end up dying of ferroptosis. Our drug doesn’t carry anything and it’s through this mechanism by which you can kill the cell.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For Garcia-Bermudez and DeBerardinis, their research efforts were like finding a needle in a haystack, one they hope to find more needles in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Our study is really exciting, but at the same time it’s a very basic discovery,” Garcia-Bermudez said. “It was incredible to discover something that people have not observed in cancer before, to understand why these tumors are so resistant. I’m super excited to keep working on this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miriam Fauzia is a science reporting fellow at The Dallas Morning News.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the &lt;strong&gt;Yunnan Province&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt; has become a focal point for scientific research due to its &lt;strong&gt;diverse ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; and proximity to both wildlife and human populations. As researchers explore the rich biodiversity of the region, new discoveries continue to emerge, many of which are unsettling. Among the most concerning findings are newly identified &lt;strong&gt;viruses&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;bats&lt;/strong&gt;, which may pose a significant risk to both &lt;strong&gt;human health&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;livestock&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Viruses Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of international researchers recently analyzed &lt;strong&gt;kidney tissue samples&lt;/strong&gt; from 142 bats collected between 2017 and 2021 in &lt;strong&gt;Yunnan&lt;/strong&gt;. Their work, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1013235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, led to the identification of &lt;strong&gt;22 previously unknown viruses&lt;/strong&gt;. Among these, &lt;strong&gt;two viruses&lt;/strong&gt; stood out due to their genetic similarities to &lt;strong&gt;henipaviruses&lt;/strong&gt;, the pathogens responsible for deadly outbreaks like &lt;em&gt;Hendra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nipah&lt;/em&gt;. These viruses have been linked to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/silent-killers-in-your-home-these-everyday-plastics-linked-to-millions-of-deaths/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the past, adding a layer of urgency to this new discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These two newly identified viruses, named &lt;em&gt;Henipavirus 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Henipavirus 2&lt;/em&gt;, share a 52% to 57% genetic match with the &lt;strong&gt;henipaviruses&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for past human outbreaks. Researchers are particularly concerned about the potential for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/china-strikes-hard-chinese-satellite-pulverizes-starlink-with-a-2-watt-laser-36000-km-from-earth/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="93501" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from bats to humans or livestock. The viruses were found in the bats’ kidneys, an organ associated with &lt;strong&gt;urine production&lt;/strong&gt;. This suggests a possible pathway for transmission through bodily fluids, particularly &lt;strong&gt;urine&lt;/strong&gt;, which could contaminate the &lt;strong&gt;environment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;fruits&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; consumed by humans or animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Hotspot for Zoonotic Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yunnan’s combination of a rich &lt;strong&gt;biodiversity&lt;/strong&gt; and frequent interactions between wildlife and human populations make it an ideal environment for the emergence of &lt;strong&gt;zoonotic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;—those that can jump from animals to humans. Similar conditions in regions like &lt;strong&gt;Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt; have already contributed to past outbreaks of the &lt;strong&gt;Nipah virus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt;, emphasizes the importance of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/chinese-scientists-unveil-worlds-most-powerful-spy-camera-capable-of-capturing-faces-from-100-km-away/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80245" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enhanced surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;prevention&lt;/strong&gt; in such areas. “These viruses are particularly concerning because they could spread through contaminated food or water,” said Balasubramaniam. “Vigilance is essential to prevent another public health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Uncovering Hidden Threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the discovery of new viruses, the study also uncovered two new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/new-microbe-on-tiangong-space-station/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="90019" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacterial species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and an unknown&lt;strong&gt; single-celled&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;parasite&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the newly identified bacterial species, &lt;em&gt;Flavobacterium yunnanensis&lt;/em&gt;, could also present potential health risks. This highlights the need for broader research into the full range of &lt;strong&gt;microorganisms&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by bats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that internal organs, such as &lt;strong&gt;kidneys&lt;/strong&gt;, may harbor a broader array of pathogens than previously thought. Most studies have focused on&lt;strong&gt; bat excretions&lt;/strong&gt;, like &lt;strong&gt;saliva&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;feces&lt;/strong&gt;, while neglecting other tissues that might contain important microbial threats.

Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) in a statement. “I’m relieved the CDC finally did the right thing — but this never should have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman and other advocates for HIV prevention funding sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month, warning that proposed cuts to these programs would reverse years of progress combating the disease and cause spikes in new cases — especially in California and among the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter cited estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, known as amfAR, suggesting the cuts could lead to 143,000 additional HIV infections nationwide and 127,000 additional deaths from AIDS-related causes within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County, which stood to lose nearly $20 million in annual federal HIV prevention funding, was looking at terminating contracts with 39 providers. Experts said the dissolution of that network could result in as many as 650 new cases per year — pushing the total number of new infections per year in the county to roughly 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public Health is grateful for the support and advocacy from the Board of Supervisors, the Los Angeles County Congressional delegation, and all of our community based providers in pushing CDC to restore this Congressionally approved funding,” a spokeswoman for the county’s health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking forward, it is important to note that the President’s FY26 budget proposes to eliminate this funding entirely, and we urge our federal partners to support this critical lifesaving funding,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPUGdDVElUSVZNVnVXTVZ0bk12V2lodkxZZ1k1VEVVVmVUR1Bja21xY1FpaGFJRDd1ZkUyUkVNdVJiODhlVlU0SEhnR1N1aEhNZXEwQ0xSd2JUUFV3NWFtSHVYckNoeHJqZWFHUW9VMWJ2SlZERWh3R1g0dmlRZUFmSGtNenA1REplRlhMbm1XZ0NoSlRi</guid></item><item><title>新墨西哥州麻疹疫情袭击县监狱-新闻记者 | Measles Outbreak Hits County Jail in New Mexico - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNVlc1cmd2MnB6N0pGX1ZkT2V4ckFtTW91UzE5UWhRaDF1WlVBaW5BenViaHNBR1NoUWJSRlZEVUdwWHdISUNvWXNYdE9Ed0NNTG9xSFNoRHliTEEwMm9WcVBHRkNPZkszQWl5RzlvNW1ka3Y1bDE3NV9GcU9hOG1KRnNQNEJhRFNJX2dISGh2YXpjQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A measles outbreak has reached the Luna County Detention Center in Deming, New Mexico, marking the first confirmed cases in the area amid a broader surge across the state. Health officials are racing to contain the spread within the facility and the local community. Luna County Manager Chris Brice says the five infected inmates are all men and their vaccination statuses are unknown, the &lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/lifestyles/health/article_4c76a3cd-8228-46a1-b1e0-9c6e1a6d44cc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Albuquerque Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The facility holds around 400 inmates and has around 100 employees, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea/new-mexico-announces-measles-outbreak-in-a-county-detention-facility.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. Measles has been detected in the city's wastewater but no cases outside the jail have been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Brice says the inmates are being quarantined in two pods, each with the capacity to hold 40 people. Two pregnant employees have been moved to other local offices. "We're trying to do our best to keep everybody isolated until we can see what's going to happen next," he says. The facility has canceled all in-person visits and court appearances have been shifted to video. Brice says the detention center has asked US Marshals and local law enforcement to write citations whenever possible instead of bringing more inmates to the facility.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that if the inmates need to be released, the facility will have to be released—and since all five are federal detainees, the facility will not have prior notice of orders to release them. The state health department plans to offer vaccination clinics at the detention center. "We can't force inmates or employees to do vaccinations, but we highly encourage them," Brice says. New Mexico now has 86 confirmed measles cases in an outbreak connected to the larger outbreak across the state border in Texas.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;ST. PAUL. Minn., June 27 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; Compulsive hoarders feel stigmatized and are more likely to view their neighborhoods as less safe and more chaotic than counterparts do, according to researchers who are seeking to promote empathy for sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapping data made available from a wide-ranging National Institutes of Health initiative, the analysts found that people with hoarding reported "significantly higher" perceived neighborhood social disorder, neighborhood physical disorder and everyday discrimination than did matched counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That perceived "daily discrimination" was also found to be a strong predictor of hoarding disorder relative to other participants, even those diagnosed with related types of obsessive-compulsive disorders, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725009929?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; online in the Journal of Affective Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study comes as medical science is struggling with how to effectively address hoarding that when left untreated can put sufferers and family members at serious risk of heath problems, injury, removal of at-risk children or older adults from the home, homelessness or in the worst case, even death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoarding also comes with high public costs. Between 2014 and 2022, more than 5,200 residential fires connected to cluttered environments resulted in 1,367 fire service injuries, 1,119 civilian injuries and over $396 million in losses, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_consequences_of_clutter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data collected&lt;/a&gt; through the National Fire Incident Reporting System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's lead author, Mississippi State University clinical psychology doctoral student Jarrod Williams, said the findings shed new light on how hoarders view themselves and their communities, and can perhaps serve to humanize them, reduce the stigma they feel and lead to new avenues of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already know that people with hoarding experience high rates of isolation and loneliness, and this study demonstrates that they not only have worse neighborhood experiences but also worse perceived discrimination," he told UPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can reduce how often people with hoarding experience discrimination and improve how they interact with their communities, that would be really helpful step in the right direction to alleviating this public health issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrists define hoarding disorder as a type of obsessive-compulsive mental health condition primarily characterized by difficulty discarding objects regardless of their value, with the result being the accumulation of clutter that compromises living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a chronic condition that particularly affects older people: an estimated 6% of older adults have hoarding disorder, compared to roughly 2% of the general population. Hoarding behaviors typically emerge before age 20, but the severity of disorder symptoms often increase with each decade of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those afflicted, compulsive hoarding results in more functional impairment than many of the most common medical and psychiatric disorders such as major depression, chronic pain and diabetes, according to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.21943" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest risks associated with severe cases include fires, injuries from falls, pest infestations and medical illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that trauma and stressful events during one's life can impact hoarding disorder, including interpersonal violence, having belongings taken by force or childhood abuse. Biology and genetics may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1990s, the "gold standard" treatment for hoarding disorder has been cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, in which a patient's beliefs about possessions and discarding are identified, challenged and modified through a process called "cognitive restructuring" This involves learning to identify and disregard irrational, harmful thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results with CBT, appearing promising. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.20673" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that 71% of patients were considered improved after 26 CBT sessions and 81% of patients rated themselves improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, treatment refusal and compliance remains a concern: Few people seek treatment for hoarding disorder on their own and &lt;a href="https://sfbacct.com/from-ocd-to-anxiety/cognitive-behavior-therapy-and-harm-reduction-for-hoarding-disorder/" target="_blank"&gt;often refuse&lt;/a&gt; treatment when it is offered to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said the Mississippi State study could provide new clues about how to approach hoarders by illuminating their "neighborhood experience," which is defined as someone's perception of their neighborhood and the victimization and/or discrimination they experience within it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using survey responses from the NIH's &lt;a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;All of Us&lt;/a&gt; research program, he and his colleagues focused on 64 participants diagnosed with HD, 1,265 participants diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder but not hoarding disorder, and 85,329 individuals without records of psychiatric issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 64 hoarding disorder patients were matched to up to five participants with OCD exactly by age, race/ethnicity, gender and using nearest neighbor matching for income, marital status and education, while up to 10 non-psychiatric control participants were matched exactly using age, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Significant differences" were found in the hoarding disorder patients' survey responses about neighborhood social cohesion and safety, neighborhood social disorder, neighborhood physical disorder, neighborhood crime/safety, medical discrimination and overall discrimination, Williams reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What these findings say to me is that people with hoarding know they're being stigmatized, and I would hypothesize that's why their neighborhood experience is worse," he said. "And I hope that this knowledge can promote a level of compassion for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would guess that part of the reason for the disfunction they experience in their communities is due to stigma and perceived stigma. Part of how we help them is being compassionate and understanding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreeing with that sentiment is Lisa M. O'Neill, associate director of research and education at the University of Arizona's Center on Aging in Tucson and a clinical assistant professor of medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also serves on the Arizona governor's Advisory Council on Aging and is the co-founder and chair of the Southern Arizona Hoarding Taskforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Neill told UPI that after five years of teaching community education classes for people struggling with hoarding behaviors, she is convinced that to make real headway against this disorder, sufferers "need to feel understood, not judged."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching them and finding effective treatments requires empathy with how they view their situations, especially among professionals and community members, she said in emailed comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For example, even if someone hasn't had any direct contact with a person who struggles with alcohol addiction, we have all had enough education to know that simply saying 'just stop drinking' isn't going to solve anything. We know that people struggling with addiction need help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While physical addiction and mental health disorders are not the same thing, education on these issues builds a community-wide understanding and hopefully a small measure of empathy," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most hoarding behaviors usually begin in adolescence or the early 20s, it's likely that every conversation sufferers have ever had with anyone about their behaviors or possessions "has not been positive, and after a lifetime of negative conversations/outcomes, they might be afraid to openly seek help because no one seems to understand," O'Neill added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with hoarding behaviors "need education and behavior modification as well as realistic tips so they can practice building new thought processes and behavior patterns -- new habits, all while keeping their anxiety and emotional distress in check," she urged, adding, "Behavior modification is hard, and it takes time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoarders' negative views of their neighborhoods are most likely influenced by their tendency to be "socially isolated from others," added Jessica Rasmussen, a psychologist with Mass General Brigham in Boston, who specializes in the psychopathology of hoarding and provides cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Individuals with HD often are dealing with depressive symptoms or social anxiety that can lead them to withdraw from those around them and be less likely to reach out for help," she told UPI in emailed comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are also frequently dealing with feelings of embarrassment or shame concerning the hoarding, they are fearful of how they will be perceived and worried about being negatively judged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is often family members, friends or the local community that may reach out for help for the individual with HD," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBT is effective and has been shown to help sufferers reduce clutter in their homes, improve their ability to discard possessions as well as resist acquiring more than they need, Rasmussen added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBT for hoarding disorder "focuses on examining beliefs about possessions and shifting them, as well as gradual exposure to discarding and resisting excessive acquisition. It also provides cognitive skills training for executive functions such as decision making and categorization."&lt;/p&gt;

While you might associate it with overdoing it on indulgent and unhealthy foods, that's not always the case - you could be eating too much veg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We've consulted a nutritionist, who has shed light on what might be causing this uncomfortable sensation. Speaking at the end of last year, she explained ways to enjoy your food without the uncomfortable feeling afterwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What triggers bloating?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Signs of bloating include a feeling of fullness or pressure in your abdomen, your abdomen feels bigger than usual, you may have stomach pain and discomfort and your stomach may gurgle or rumble," says Dr Emma Derbyshire, public health nutritionist and advisor to PrecisionBiotics. "Bloating can range from mildly uncomfortable to intensively painful."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most prevalent cause of bloating is gastrointestinal gas, the nutritionist clarifies. "This can be a digestive issue and may be simply caused by eating too fast, a food intolerance or food allergy that causes digestive issues and gas to build up," notes Dr Derbyshire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Menstrual cycles are among the factors that contribute to bloating, according to Dr Derbyshire: "As your period approaches hormone levels change causing your body to retain water and cause bloating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Anxiety can also cause bloating often due to the swallowing of air. Medical conditions such as irritable bowel may also result in bloating."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-10-special" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The health dangers of nightmares and how the 'Mummy's Curse' is curing cancer - all this and more in our latest newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why are some people more affected by bloating?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some people are more prone to bloating than others due to factors like food intolerances, IBS and an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria - i.e. a lower proportion of healthy to less healthy bacteria," Dr Derbyshire points out. "An unhealthy gut microbiota may be caused by diet with highly processed food high in fat, sugar and salt being a possible culprit."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Derbyshire said treat-type foods are often high in fat, sugar and refined carbohydrates, which are tasty and easy to eat quickly and in large amounts and can be difficult to digest. Stress and too much alcohol may also contribute to bloating, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But one piece of advice she has might come as a surprise - considering reducing intake of cruciferous vegetables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cutting your intake of cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts and legumes such as peas, beans and lentils can also help reduce wind and bloating," advises Dr Derbyshire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Stay active&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Keep moving with a good walk or run each day," Dr Derbyshire suggests. "Try some exercise snacks around the house: squats, push-ups and a few weights if you have them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Eat fewer sugary treats&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Deryshire suggests "going easy" on high-fat, high-sugar foods, as they can "contribute to less healthy gut bacteria". She added: "However, there is no need to totally avoid these foods - just aim for smaller quantities."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31935695" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Manage your stress levels&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Practice stress management techniques like slow deep breathing and try to relax," Dr Derbyshire advises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Go easy on the alcohol and stay well hydrated," Dr Derbyshire recommends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Try probiotics&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Probiotics can help reduce bloating by introducing healthy bacteria into the gut," Dr Derbyshire explains. "But it's important to look to specific, studied strains such as Bifidobacterium longum 35624, which are backed by scientific studies and have been shown to reduce abdominal pain and bloating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNY1Q5QlRZUlVhVXVQRHQ5ZDhTV2pPdGtpZkFmMGVpRE1YLUhCc3RyeUc3TkZxbmlmVC00Ykd5SElMMDJDMnduQUJKWkVMdDJ4MVFDQ2J6VzFDSDAxdHptNHNYWVd4R25DbHplRXhyUktXaDlMTjRJVThETUxNMFc2V0hIVmF5VHJGUGNR</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic对您脸部的真正影响：从大嘴唇到凹陷的眼睛，使用瘦身刺拳的所有明显迹象-每日邮报 | What Ozempic really does to your face: All the tell-tale signs of using skinny jabs, from bigger lips to sunken eyes - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNY0FnaXl6NGU4Rkl6dTY5Ym1QYlU1eWpucUUtRS1jQ1hyVHU1M1Y1SEV5ZFh5U3dkSVVPZjdjSWRUT0NIWVdqSS1sOFNwNVlNck9IZXAyN2R0azZwTXVmVHoxaHdNOEliR3N1Yy1OaWVWZ3BoMklJbnJVREJMUVlYVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ozempic boom has seen a drug widely used to treat &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f40a5e70-52d4-11f0-b28d-2386429dcdcd"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and manage obesity in adults transform into 'miracle' &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-f419eed0-52d4-11f0-b28d-2386429dcdcd"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; jab that's coveted by anyone with a few extra kilos to shed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic and other alternatives like Mounjaro and Wegovy are all different brand names for the drug semaglutide that &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11674557/A-miracle-obesity-cure-dangerous-TikTok-trend-adored-Hollywood.html"&gt;mimics the the actions of GLP-1 - a hormone in the brain that regulates appetite and feelings of fullness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weekly doses of these blockbuster weight loss medicines can help people shed 15 to 20 per cent of their body weight on average - but it can also pile on the years and make you look older than you are, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rapid and drastic weight loss &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11673557/Miracle-weight-loss-drug-trending-TikTok-cause-facial-aging.html"&gt;triggered by these medicines&lt;/a&gt; has left people 'freaking out' about developing so-called 'Ozempic face', celebrity nutritionist Rose Ferguson told Femail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 49-year-old former model, who is close friends with &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/kate-moss/index.html" id="mol-f34adf00-52d4-11f0-b28d-2386429dcdcd"&gt;Kate Moss&lt;/a&gt; and boasts 116,000 followers on Instagram, reported a rise in the number of her clients who are worried about their face transfroming from these injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Semaglutide, which is not a targeted drug, does not just cause loss around the stomach and thighs, but the entire body - including the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that, although it has helped millions around the world achieve their weight loss goals, the 'skinny shot' can also famously make users look extremely gaunt over time - a phenomenon critics have unflatteringly labelled 'Ozempic face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how exactly does Ozempic manifest? Dermatologists, aestheticians and cosmetic surgeons break down the tell-tale signs to watch for, as more information about the drug's side effects become known. &lt;/p&gt;

An increase in the amount of acid 'can erode your teeth,' Dr Daniel Atkinson, clinical lead at Treated.com, told the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, Ozempic's appetite-suppression qualities can make it difficult for the body to get the nutrients it requires to maintain healthy teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:04:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNY0FnaXl6NGU4Rkl6dTY5Ym1QYlU1eWpucUUtRS1jQ1hyVHU1M1Y1SEV5ZFh5U3dkSVVPZjdjSWRUT0NIWVdqSS1sOFNwNVlNck9IZXAyN2R0azZwTXVmVHoxaHdNOEliR3N1Yy1OaWVWZ3BoMklJbnJVREJMUVlYVQ</guid></item><item><title>根据肠道健康专家的说法，帮助您排便的最佳补充剂- EatingWell | The Best Supplement to Help You Poop, According to Gut Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFB4bGhuQzB6MnhyaHlTZXgzaTNzSXpRT29oaDNQX1NwMXEybTRkbHNqUlFCSTEtRzB0ZjB0RnFuQi0tNXFfeFV3cWJpQng5NHJfd2l1eGFycGxwVlI1Rkk5X180NkpqNEZBaXdZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psyllium husk is a fiber supplement that supports regular bowel movements and a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gradually add psyllium fiber to your diet—add it to smoothies, muffins or drink it with water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming fiber-rich foods, plenty of water and staying active also help with constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation is a common digestive issue that can leave you feeling bloated, sluggish and downright uncomfortable. When stool moves too slowly through the colon, it becomes dry and hard to pass. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enter: psyllium husk. This supplement, from the herb &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt;, can help relieve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; and improve gut health. Psyllium husk contains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; that absorbs water in the gut and forms a gel-like substance, softening the stool and promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beyond easing constipation, psyllium husk also feeds beneficial gut bacteria and supports overall digestive health, making it a standout herb for improving bowel regularity and gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-psyllium-husk-is-great-to-help-you-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Psyllium Husk Is Great to Help You Poop &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contains Soluble Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk contains a highly viscous form of soluble fiber. When a fiber is characterized as viscous, it means it creates a texture that helps pass stool. “When psyllium is mixed with water, it creates a gel-like substance that helps hold water in the stool. This adds more bulk to it and softens it so that it’s easier to pass,” says Emily Lotterhand, M.B.A., RD, LDN. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports a Healthy Gut Microbiome &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to its fiber content, Lotterhand says, “Psyllium Husk also acts as a prebiotic, meaning that it feeds the good bacteria in the gut.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A balanced gut microbiome is linked to more regular bowel movements and fewer digestive issues overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Promotes Regularity Without Harsh Side Effects &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike stimulant laxatives, which can cause cramping or urgency, psyllium husk works with your body’s natural rhythms to improve the movement of stool through your digestive tract. Because it adds bulk and softens stool through water absorption, psyllium husk supports regularity more gently. That means fewer surprises and more consistency when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-of-day-to-poop-11744316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bathroom habits&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Helps Reduce Inflammation in the Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Constipation and inflammation&lt;/a&gt; often go hand in hand, especially when stool lingers in the colon.4 Psyllium’s role in softening stool and supporting microbial balance may also help reduce irritation in the digestive tract. Lotterhand adds that psyllium husk “contributes to maintaining the gut lining’s structural integrity and reducing inflammation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding Psyllium husk is not as easy as increasing fiber more generally in your diet. “Psyllium husk doesn’t naturally occur in the foods we commonly eat, as it comes from the outer coating of seeds from the &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plant,” Lotterhand says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk is found in many over-the-counter supplements and different forms—powders, granules, capsules and liquid form. You can even find psyllium husk wafers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to smoothies:&lt;/strong&gt; Stir a teaspoon of powder into your morning &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8031503/30-day-smoothie-plan-to-help-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for a fiber boost that blends in easily without affecting the flavor. Just be sure to drink it quickly—it thickens over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix into baked goods:&lt;/strong&gt; You can add psyllium husk powder to muffin, bread, or pancake batter to increase the fiber content of your favorite recipes. It also acts as a binder, which can help improve the texture of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4251/gluten-free-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gluten-free&lt;/a&gt; baked goods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on oatmeal or yogurt:&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle a small spoonful of psyllium husk powder over a bowl of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-hacks-better-oatmeal-11704604" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or yogurt to add gut-friendly fiber. Follow it with a glass of water to support proper digestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use in fortified cereals: &lt;/strong&gt;Many high-fiber cereals feature psyllium husk as an ingredient.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Psyllium Husk to Your Diet Slowly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to psyllium husk, start with a small amount and increase gradually over several days. “If your body isn’t used to the extra fiber, it might lead to bloating, gas, or cramping,” says Lotterhand. Drinking plenty of water is also key. Psyllium husk needs fluid to work effectively and prevent further constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to include more fiber-rich foods like oats, barley, legumes, fruits, vegetables and seeds in your daily meals. Soluble fibers, in particular, help soften stool and support regular bowel movements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking enough water is essential when increasing fiber intake. Without &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-help-this-dietitian-stay-hydrated-11753491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate fluids&lt;/a&gt;, fiber can worsen constipation by making stool more difficult to pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity stimulates the muscles in your digestive tract, which can help promote more consistent bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even a daily walk can make a difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can disrupt digestion and contribute to constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;6 Mindfulness practices, deep breathing and other stress-reduction techniques may help restore gut balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor or inconsistent sleep can affect hormone regulation and digestion. Prioritizing rest supports overall gut function and helps keep things moving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk is a natural, effective fiber that softens stool and supports regular bowel movements while nourishing a healthy gut microbiome. To avoid discomfort, introduce it gradually and stay well hydrated. Along with psyllium, eating more fiber-rich foods, drinking enough water, staying active and managing stress can help keep digestion on track and relieve constipation.

			&lt;p&gt;We know  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="165970" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is good for an alertness boost first thing in the morning or during an afternoon lull, but researchers have also linked the compound to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt; – and a new study takes a close look at some of the cellular mechanisms responsible for that link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and the Francis Crick Institute in the UK used &lt;span&gt;fission&lt;/span&gt; yeast as stand-ins for human cells, analyzing how doses of caffeine affected the lifespan of the cells and their ability to withstand damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings help explain why caffeine might be beneficial for health and longevity," &lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2025/science-and-engineering/se/caffeine-could-slow-cellular-ageing-new-research-shows-how.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist John-Patrick Alao, from QMUL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And they open up exciting possibilities for future research into how we might trigger these effects more directly – with diet, lifestyle, or new medicines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12080"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that caffeine could operate a biological switch called TOR (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR"&gt;target of rapamycin&lt;/a&gt;), which helps regulate the growth of cells in response to food and energy availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the latest experiments, the researchers determined that caffeine doesn't interact directly with TOR. Instead, it controls it through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase"&gt;AMPK&lt;/a&gt; pathway, which works kind of like a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/bse0430121"&gt;fuel gauge for cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165973" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165973" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis.jpg" alt="Cell division chart" class="wp-image-165973 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis-591x415.jpg 591w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165973" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked cell division against certain genetic edits. (Alao et al., &lt;em&gt;Microbial Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that AMPK takes care of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm.2017.95"&gt;some vital jobs&lt;/a&gt; in terms of keeping cells running and helping them resist wear and tear more effectively. Now we also know that caffeine has an effect on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope, and our results show that caffeine helps flip that switch," &lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2025/science-and-engineering/se/caffeine-could-slow-cellular-ageing-new-research-shows-how.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist and biologist Charalampos Rallis, from QMUL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With caffeine operating the TOR lever through the AMPK enzyme, cells are affected in three different ways, the researchers found: in how they grow, in how they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-watch-bacteria-fix-their-broken-dna-in-real-time-to-see-exactly-how-it-s-done"&gt;repair their DNA&lt;/a&gt;, and in how they respond to stress. That all adds up to cells that stay healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers interrupted the genetic chain reaction that caffeine triggers, the cells didn't get all of the same health benefits – confirmation of how the compound is working, and perhaps, how we might be able to utilize it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165970" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug metformin is currently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-drug-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;being looked at&lt;/a&gt; as a way of keeping us in better shape for a longer period of time, and it too operates through AMPK – suggesting caffeine-based drugs may have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any kind of medication or treatment is still a long way off however, not least because these findings are from yeast cells rather than human cells. The researchers are still keen to learn more about the precise way caffeine interacts with AMPK and TOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can certainly say for now is that more and more studies are showing positive effects from caffeine consumption, whether that's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-may-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;losing body fat&lt;/a&gt;, protecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;against cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-coffee-linked-to-lower-risk-of-dementia-but-theres-a-catch"&gt;keeping dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Direct pharmacological targeting of AMPK may serve towards healthspan and lifespan benefits beyond yeasts, given the highly conserved nature of this key regulatory cellular energy sensor," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15698/mic2025.06.852"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15698/mic2025.06.852"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microbial Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
