The Moderna contract built on a previous government investment of $175 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The move was not entirely unexpected. The Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this year that it was reviewing the contract. And Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly questioned the safety of mRNA technology, which is used in Moderna’s Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;First used for the Covid vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, mRNA shots instruct the body to produce a fragment of the virus, which then sets off the body’s immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, said: “After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna’s H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Moderna said &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Update-on-Investigational-Pandemic-Influenza-Program-/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it would explore alternatives&lt;/a&gt; for developing the vaccines covered by the contract, which were to be designed for several types of flu viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

It is not a medical disaster. It is a bodily process, like giving birth or like going to the bathroom or coughing,” she continues. “Your body knows what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She’ll eat and drink less, for example, and sleep a lot more; she won’t get out of bed and might become delirious. Eventually, her breathing will slow down until the death rattles take over. She might even experience “the rally”, the nurse says, or a burst of energy and mental clarity days before her last breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scene is based on real events in the life of Molly Kochan, who received a &lt;a href="https://everythingleadstothis.com/2015/08/12/everything-leads-to-this/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminal breast cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and embarked on a sexual journey until her death four years later. Kochan, who died at age 46, documented her experiences in a &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3zzOFMwPlA0bbPkt4R0Lku" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with her best friend, Nikki Boyer, which inspired the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b4a99c13-b22b-480c-b1cb-8283c0505284" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m a death expert.

It feels too scary or sad,” says Kim Rosenstock, the show’s co-creator, writer and executive producer. “So we felt like we had an opportunity to depict death in a different way. And in doing so, to hopefully make death feel even a tiny bit less mysterious and scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To some extent, each death is unique because it depends on a person’s age, health status and reason for dying, says Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse and online educator in Los Angeles, California. But for those unaffected by a traumatic event, such as a car accident, most people will experience certain stages and symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say that knowing more about death – which they call “death literacy” – can actually help quell fears of dying. Here’s what they said about the science and psychology of the death process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-transition-phase" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The transition phase&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Months before death, the transition phase begins, says McFadden. This entails spending more time in bed, eating and drinking less, and needing more help with daily tasks such as getting dressed and going to the bathroom. During this time, it can be hard to keep up with conversations and sleep will take up most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This stage can be particularly difficult to notice in people who have conditions such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease, adds McFadden, because the signs mirror those of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The transition phase could also involve a “detachment from the world” in a way that makes time feel non-existent, says &lt;a href="https://coleimperi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cole Imperi&lt;/a&gt;, a certified thanatologist, a specialist who studies death, dying, grief and loss. Senses will begin to dull as well, she says, so sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch won’t be as intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Due to a lower food and beverage intake, at this point it’s possible to enter ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose. Imperi says some people may experience pain relief or euphoria as a result, but it’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987706005779" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not entirely clear why&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2722878/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the neurotransmitter Gaba increases during ketosis, which makes you feel calm, while cortisol, the stress hormone, decreases, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="active-dying" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Active dying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these symptoms will worsen until the last stage of life, called “active dying”, says McFadden. This can begin a few days or hours before death. For the most part, a person is unconscious, she says, and breathing and heart rate can become irregular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If respiration or heart rate becomes too erratic and causes discomfort, hospice workers can bring in a music-thanatologist to help stabilize vitals and ease anxiety, says Imperi. These trained professionals play the harp and use their voice at bedside. “When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork,” says Imperi, “so when music-thanatologists come in, the body sort of tethers itself to the pattern of their music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About a third of dying people undergo this sudden rush of mental clarity shortly before they die, according to McFadden. For a brief couple of days, hours or even minutes, personalities return, loved ones’ names are remembered and favorite foods are craved yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s not a definitive scientific reason why this happens,” says Imperi. “But I will say that it is a beautiful, beautiful gift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also very common, at any point during active dying, to experience hallucinations or visions that typically involve loved ones who have passed. Imperi says dying people often talk about needing to pack their suitcase or waiting to be picked up at an airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="terminal-secretions-or-the-death-rattle" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Terminal secretions, or the ‘death rattle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The last thing that happens before death is a change in breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes respiration, says Imperi. Like a fish out of water, a person experiences a series of rapid breaths followed by long periods of no breathing. As a result, one can’t swallow mucus or saliva, so it thickens and builds up in the back of the throat, making each breath sound a bit gurgly, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These noises are called terminal secretions, commonly referred to as the “death rattle”. Although it sounds painful, Cheyne-Stokes breathing doesn’t hurt – just like most of the active dying process, says McFadden, who says she can tell based on patients’ non-verbal cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dying person is like a baby,” McFadden says. “Babies can’t say they’re hungry or teething, but you can tell something is wrong by how they’re acting. Dying people are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-death-literacy-is-important" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why death literacy is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In American culture, death is largely feared and seen as this disaster to avoid at all costs,” says Rosenstock. “It was important to us to convey the dying process in a truthful way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s normal to be scared of death because it’s in our nature to survive, says Imperi, but the best way to quash a fear of dying is to educate yourself. Several &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82421-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the more we learn about and contemplate death, the less anxiety we have about experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Death literacy can be especially helpful for people who are already dying, McFadden says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":32,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Dying for Sex review – Michelle Williams’ erotic journey is revolutionary TV","elementId":"0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most people are not comfortable talking about it, so everyone skirts around the issue. But at the end of the day, they do want answers, and generally speaking, we have some,” McFadden says. “We don’t know exactly what it’s going to be like after you’re gone, but we know enough about what you can expect [during the process], and in most cases, my patients and their families sigh with relief once they learn more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s because one of the hardest parts about dying is losing control, says Imperi, and death education can help put the ball back in your court. On the other hand, some people might find a sense of control by refusing to learn more about what’s happening to them or their loved one, adds Imperi, which can be equally as therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Supporting that resistance is sometimes more important,” says Imperi, because that might be what a person needs at that point in their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Above all, “we are built for death just like we’re built for birth”, says McFadden. “The more we understand that, the better we will live – and the more peaceful we will die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13bnFrWEg2RVV3QXRxZlV1SHM5ME1OVlIyaS1ZODZ5X1ZpRERKdWpaNFkwVTk5Vnlyb1BMVUhFcGpnSF9NMjUtVHFyd2VOMHRELTA2a2Rjei12WjhibXlaTGZMU2tyMXJpN3VDa1IyckFqMldVVkJBYVF3WmpMSVU</guid></item><item><title>加州大学旧金山分校的研究揭示了令人不安的新大麻健康风险- SFGATE | UC San Francisco study uncovers troubling new cannabis health risk - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPNUhkSTJDNkhzV19BQVZ3NEsya2hiM1ZXTnM2QVVScjUwRUhMdktYaF93SXdGdVlIWWZxNVlsZC01VE5iZEN5dVhJZFh6N1NMVVMxNHNWNDBycUlublR3VmdqRzFaNTZCb2I1UlNnRXRZWElkdXVYMFdUZ1VTRkdPSlR6WlRFOXdtRDZOMGVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Researchers collaborated to simulate how vesicles—tiny sacs that release neurotransmitters—operate within synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model reveals how proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate the recycling of vesicles, enabling synaptic transmission even at high firing rates. This breakthrough clarifies a long-standing mystery in neuroscience and opens the door to better understanding of diseases like depression and myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vesicle Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 10–20% of vesicles are active at a time; the rest are stored in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate vesicle movement and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could aid treatments for disorders involving faulty synaptic transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;OIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we think, feel, remember, or move? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These processes involve synaptic transmission, in which chemical signals are transmitted between nerve cells using molecular containers called vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have successfully modeled the vesicle cycle in unprecedented detail, revealing new information about the way our brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110470"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This is an illustration of a vesicle." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, between researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, and the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), Germany, has applied a unique computational modeling system, which considers the complicated interplay of vesicles, their cellular environments, activities and interactions, to create a realistic picture of how vesicles support synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model predicts parameters of synaptic function that could not be tested experimentally in the past, opening new avenues in neuroscience investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent technological advances have enabled experimental scientists to capture increasing amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The challenge now lies in integrating and interpreting all the different types of data, to understand the complexities of the brain,” said Professor Erik De Schutter, head of the OIST Computational Neuroscience Unit and co-author on this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our model provides better molecular and spatial detail of the vesicle cycle, and much faster, than any other systems before. And it’s transferable to different cells and scenarios too. It’s a significant leap forward towards scientific aspirations of full cell and full tissue simulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working on synapses for over 20 years, but some functional steps were difficult to test experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After several years of fine-tuning experimental and computational work with our Japanese colleagues, we now have a model for testing new hypotheses, especially in the context of neurological diseases”, added Professor Silvio Rizzoli, director of the Department for Neuro- and Sensory Physiology at the UMG and also co-author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the synaptic vesicle cycle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vesicle cycle describes the steps through which neurotransmitters (chemical signals) are released at a synapse (a junction between nerve cells), to transfer information between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move and dock at the membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents, before being recycled. The process is prompted by electrical stimulation within the brain and is driven by a complex signaling cascade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, different amounts of neurotransmitters need to be released over different time periods. To enable controlled and sustained synaptic transmission, only 10-20% of vesicles are readily available to dock at any given time (these are known as the recycling pool). Most vesicles are instead in a reserve pool, immobilized in a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many details of this process, including how vesicles move between the reserve and recycling pool, were poorly known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mechanisms of vesicle recycling at high stimulation frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their publication, the researchers shed new light on the vesicle recycling process in hippocampal synapses. With their model, they aimed to both confirm the behavior of vesicles at experimentally-observed firing frequencies, and explore behavior at higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also able to pinpoint some of the reasons behind this robust cycle, identifying the roles of key proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 in regulating vesicle release from the clustered reserve pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the efficiency of the vesicle cycle relied on molecular tethering. By physically connecting some vesicles to the membrane with tethers, a close supply of vesicles could be made available for rapid docking and neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These important findings enable deeper understanding of vesicle recycling, a process involved in many different diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the release of neurotransmitters is hampered in botulism or some myasthenic syndromes. Treatments for depression and other major neurological diseases also often focus on synaptic transmission,” explained Prof. De Schutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we expand our models, the potential applications are vast, both in developing new therapeutics, and in deepening our fundamental understanding of how the brain works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3879c9e9c9e9add9c9886919cb39c9a8087dd9983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tomomi Okubo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://oist.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;OIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tomomi Okubo – OIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq6477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/a&gt;” by Erik De Schutter et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission is driven by a complex cycle of vesicle docking, release, and recycling, maintained by distinct vesicle pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the partitioning of vesicle pools and reserve pool recruitment remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a novel vesicle modeling technology to model the synaptic vesicle cycle in unprecedented molecular and spatial detail at a hippocampal synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE0zUVBGSlBEcFFTaXh1Rng0Z0FUbkxHU3VGX1E2S1Rvd3ZOcUVyUW00QXRna1VpdFNueHAtQVBkam03U1d2aVlIcm5PM1ZLQzE1alBNNU1pQzlQN0V1bm9rcDVrYTNQSEVmYVlR</guid></item><item><title>肖恩·汉尼提（ Sean Hannity ）突然对“愚蠢的流感疫苗”有很多话要说-媒体对美国很重要 | Sean Hannity has a lot to say about the “stupid flu shot” all of a sudden - Media Matters for America</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZF9vMUsyZTc4Z2hMN3dqSUZIcEh5b0kyei1zTzlnVW1DZDBmcG9KMEl4cmFRVFoyR2U2eEsweV9mZnA2QmNxLW90NVZUMGdjMjZERHFEZzd2a1BhYW53MzBkMU1aWUFpaHByVzByTXk4cFdKamJSYjc4MU94YzhMQ1Nqc2VoaElYSEhZSnhCQmFYSkJwM3JYdTBvRElzSWlj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="block-quote__quote"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SEAN HANNITY (HOST): And even the creator, who I know you're familiar with, Dr. Robert Malone, was very outspoken, and he came on this program often. And he said that mRNA technology has not been perfected. He did support emergency authorization vaccinations for people over 65 that had preexisting conditions and comorbidities because they were the ones that were more likely to be -- their lives would be put in jeopardy by the virus. He absolutely was crystal clear. It was not designed for healthy people that were younger, meaning below the age of 65, and it's absolutely not designed for children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, he's the one that created the technology that allowed for the creation of this, and he's saying this. And then he gets excoriated like you got excoriated for trying alternative treatment, which, by the way, studies, since that time have proven that you were right about things like hydroxychloroquine taken early, mitigating circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many studies now have come out confirming that? How many studies have come out showing that masks really didn't help? How many studies came out, you know, showing that your protocols actually worked? How many patients' lives did you save, and how many patients did you lose in the process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DR. BRIAN TYSON (GUEST): Yeah. I mean, it's -- so you're 100% correct. If you go to the website c19.org, you'll be able to pull up all the different treatments and all of the studies that are listed underneath those. There's over 400 studies on hydroxychloroquine, there's over 300 studies on ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was early treatment is the key. It's not about vaccines at this point because these vaccines are not effective. Actually, they're negative effective, just like last year's flu shot. Last year's flu shot had a negative efficacy of 26%, meaning those who got the flu shot were more likely to get the flu. It's the same thing with these COVID vaccine boosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HANNITY: Well, people don't understand that. Every year, they will start producing a flu virus. They're guessing what flu is likely to hit. They don't know for sure. And my understanding is that they're wrong 75% of the time, and people, you know, annually go get the stupid flu shot anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TYSON: Yeah. But they made $6 billion off of it last year. And that's the problem. When you continuously approve vaccines without data and without research -- this is where you know the MAHA movement is -- hopefully it's going to make some ground -- you can't continue to produce vaccines without seeing the results. And you have to start holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;When Sarah Beran started noticing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-today-colon-cancer-diagnosis-early-symptoms-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood in her poop&lt;/a&gt;, she didn't know how to bring it up to her doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like I went in there with my tail between my legs, and not only was I talking about poop, but I was talking about my butt and blood and it's just all these things you don't want to talk about," Beran, 39, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran, who was later diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at age 34, went on to talk about bowel movements a lot: she co-founded &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.worldclassclothing.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Worldclass&lt;/a&gt;, an apparel brand that donates proceeds to fund colonoscopies for people who are underinsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran's experience of anal bleeding is not uncommon. It is statistically the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2024/november-december-2024-volume-109-issue-10/clinicians-struggle-to-understand-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;most common warning sign&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer in patients under 50&lt;/a&gt;.

The other hurdle is stigma: people just don't want to talk about seeing blood in the toilet or in their pencil-thin stools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, it's something that I see quite frequently," Dr. Fola May, a gastroenterologist and an associate professor of Medicine at UCLA, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it's common for people to ignore and they may avoid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sharing their symptoms&lt;/a&gt; out of embarrassment. "They delay bringing it up until it gets more and more severe, and they actually can't function or have a normal workday," May added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, their cancer is likely to have progressed to later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dc18d645-de64-41b5-9de4-286bba25de41" data-toc-id="dc18d645-de64-41b5-9de4-286bba25de41"&gt;Anal bleeding is common with younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early colon cancer symptoms are easy to miss. Abdominal pain or constipation can be linked to many different conditions, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-symptoms-pain-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;celiac disease or IBS. &lt;/a&gt;That's why rectal bleeding is important to flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Demb, a researcher who studies early-onset colon cancer and an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, led a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819248" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; on the most common symptoms of colon cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demb's study found rectal bleeding was the most common sign of colon cancer — more than altered bowel movements or abdominal pain — because it was more specific and harder to explain with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to know how seriously to take some symptoms. Anal bleeding is often caused by non-life threatening conditions like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/why-does-my-butthole-itch" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;. Some patients who are otherwise young, healthy, and who have no family history can be dismissed by doctors, partly because colonoscopies are more involved procedures and can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/colon-cancer/colonoscopy-cost" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;cost a few thousand dollars&lt;/a&gt; without insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficult work is making sure a symptom is "attributed to the correct condition," Demb said, without preemptively scaring people or overlooking the early signs of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c1f258d5-c987-48db-ae17-f32bbac8c3fe" data-toc-id="c1f258d5-c987-48db-ae17-f32bbac8c3fe"&gt;Millennials are afraid to talk about stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poop has a long history of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-is-shitting-still-so-embarrassing/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;being taboo&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as unsanitary and embarrassing. As societies like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/pages/why-are-we-so-awkward-about-poop-transcript" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Victorian-era England&lt;/a&gt; developed indoor plumbing and individual latrines to replace communal ones, defecation became more private — and consequently more shameful to talk about in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma has never really gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From interviewing colon cancer patients, Demb learned many young people are afraid to broach the topic of poop and rectal bleeding with their doctor, even though that conversation could be life-saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of that apprehension comes from probably not having had to discuss this ever before in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people enter their 50s and colonoscopies become standard care, talking about bowel movements becomes slightly more normalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Naiké Vorbe started cycling through diarrhea and constipation, she didn't know how to talk about it, and hesitated at first. "You don't really speak about gastrointestinal issues," Vorbe, who grew up in Haiti, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vorbe was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3B colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at 31. By then, her cancer had spread so much that she needed to have parts of her colon and liver removed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Chris Rodriguez, who was otherwise fit and healthy when he was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer at 35, remembers feeling embarrassed about sharing his digestive agony with friends, relatives, and even doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He feels from personal experience that younger people are averse to talking about cancer because they feel they're "not supposed to" be worrying about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that people are too afraid to talk about these things with their doctor, too afraid to talk about these things with anybody around them," Rodriguez, now 37, told BI. "That's pretty scary for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vorbe and Rodriguez both had late-stage cancer and rectal bleeding as a symptom. It makes the symptom all the more important to flag: sometimes, blood in the stool won't show up until the cancer has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0528ada7-dce3-4dfe-9e83-605df7806c0f" data-toc-id="0528ada7-dce3-4dfe-9e83-605df7806c0f"&gt;The push to make rectal bleeding less taboo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks Bell, one of the Worldclass co-founders, remembers struggling to share how she was feeling with her husband — they weren't the types to use the bathroom with the door open, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

"Our relationship did not have those features, and so it can be so awkward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she and Beran are trying to help younger people feel emboldened to talk about colon cancer symptoms and taboo body parts. Their brand, Worldclass, sells merch that says "Ass" and "Colonoscopy Enthusiast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell also founded Lead From Behind, a campaign backed by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance that involved Ryan Reynolds and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rob-mcelhenney-always-sunny-philadelphia-wrexham-wife-learning-disability-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob McElhenney&lt;/a&gt; getting &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sXkIUZEWIo" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;colonoscopies on camera&lt;/a&gt; to normalize the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, the biggest change might have to start in the doctor's office. Even though she's a GI doctor, May said she still gets patients who blush when they talk about their bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May says she tries to shift that dynamic by being intentional about her language. "When I'm in public, I say words like 'rectum' and 'poop' and 'stool,'" she said, adding that she wants her peers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about blood in poop should be as normalized as talking about spotting &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/breast-cancer-signs-symptoms-lump-nipple-discharge-pain-2022-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;breast cancer lumps&lt;/a&gt;, May said. "Until we make them normal in public," she continued, "people will feel uncomfortable producing those words from their mouths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ade30bfb-2c84-4676-9323-2f7947e8e86b" data-toc-id="ade30bfb-2c84-4676-9323-2f7947e8e86b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to know if you have a colon cancer symptom, or if it's something else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because early colon cancer symptoms can be so ambiguous, Demb said the more important thing to look out for is deviation from your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you normally have very consistent bowel movements and suddenly have persistent diarrhea, see a GI. If you have ongoing rectal bleeding for the first time in your life or unusual stomach pain that won't go away, consider &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-had-my-first-colonoscopy-in-my-twenties-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;booking a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May also suggested getting a colonoscopy sooner if you have any family history of the cancer. She recommended getting screened at age 40 instead of the standard 45, and for primary care physicians to start bringing up the potential of screening before age 45 in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because colonoscopies can be expensive and inaccessible to people under 45, the best anyone can do is be vigilant, Demb said of symptoms like anal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who is now cancer-free, believes it's important to investigate any warning signs. "You're not being silly by thinking about them," he said. "You're not overreacting by thinking it could be cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Kim Schewitz and Mia de Graaf.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many people ignore or downplay the sudden symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a ministroke—but new research suggests that's a mistake. A large study published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2830012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Alabama-Birmingham and University of Cincinnati tracked more than 30,000 adults and found TIA survivors show a cognitive decline over five years that matches the rate seen in stroke survivors, per &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ministrokes-can-be-just-as-dangerous-for-the-brain-as-regular-strokes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The decline isn't usually immediate, but over time, and TIAs appear to change a person's cognitive trajectory, possibly leading to increased risk for dementia later. "If you have one stroke or one TIA ... the rate of cognitive decline is the same," says lead author Victor Del Bene.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        About 240,000 Americans every year &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/lets-talk-about-stroke/transient-ischemic-attack#:~:text=About%20240%2C000%20Americans%20experience%20a,severe%20stroke%20within%20a%20year."&gt;have a TIA&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms are fleeting, often resolving within minutes, so many don't seek urgent care. Indiana office manager Kristin Kramer, 54, is one example. She experienced slurred speech and weakness in her hand but returned to bed without seeking help. Her symptoms disappeared, but days later she was unable to sign her name and learned she'd had a small stroke. Doctors warn that ignoring-the-problem approach is risky: The chance of a full stroke within 90 days is 5% to 20%, with much of that risk in the first two days.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "These events are serious, acute, and dangerous," Dr. Clay Johnston, a neurologist and chief medical officer at Harbor Health in Austin, Texas, tells the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/health/elderly-tia-stroke.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Experts urge using the &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/know-signs-of-stroke-be-fast"&gt;"BE FAST" checklist&lt;/a&gt;—for balance, eyesight, face, arms, speech, and time, as in don't let too much time pass before calling 911 at the first sign of trouble. The overriding takeaway: TIAs are more serious than their "transient" label suggests, and ignoring symptoms or putting off treatment can lead to lasting harm. Some experts argue for renaming TIAs "minor ischemic strokes" to prompt faster responses—or to simply include the word "stroke" somewhere in the description, per the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.

It is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14750265/hepatitis-outbreak-elite-enclave-rich-famous-provincetown-massachusetts.html"&gt;first reported case&lt;/a&gt; of Zika in Hawaii since 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/zika_virus/index.html" id="mol-969a7ef0-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920" class=""&gt;Zika virus&lt;/a&gt; is transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquito, which also spread dengue and chikungunya viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are common in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-969c2ca0-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-969b1b30-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in the US, particularly in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most adults do not become seriously ill from the infection, but in rare cases it can cause damage to the nerves, brain, or spinal cord as well as a blood disorder that can result in bleeding, bruising or slow blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zika infection during pregnancy can also cause serious birth defects and is linked to pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Zika virus has landed in Hawaii, with two individuals exposed to the paralysis-causing infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, Zika virus cases are mostly travel-associated, with limited local transmission. The number of cases has varied significantly year to year, with a high point in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In that year, there were over 5,000 travel-associated cases, with 224 locally acquired cases. However, following this high, the number of cases dropped significantly, to over 400 in 2017 and in 2023, there were just 7 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii's health department says it is currently monitoring mosquito activity in the affected areas and will 'implement further control measures as needed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents and tourists alike are being urged to take additional precautions to reduce mosquito breeding and avoid bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the recommendations on a health advisory include wearing insect repellent at all times while outdoors and dressing in loose-fitting long-sleeved shirts and pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Islanders have also been instructed to check their insect screens are intact, with doors kept closed. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eating more minimally processed plant-based proteins – such as beans, nuts and lentils – may lower the risk for high blood pressure, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.124.037813" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published recently in the Journal of the American Heart Association, also suggested that minimally processed animal proteins could be included in weekly meal plans without significantly affecting a person’s high blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study focused on foods, not the plant-based supplements that can be found on store shelves,” said the study’s senior author Dr. Marcia Otto, a nutritional epidemiologist and an associate professor at UT Health Houston School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure, or hypertension, a condition that raises the risk for heart attacks, strokes and other health problems. Prior research has shown diet plays a critical role in the prevention and management of high blood pressure. A large body of evidence finds that eating patterns rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy that are also low in sodium and saturated fat can significantly reduce blood pressure. But how proteins within these eating patterns affect blood pressure has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated how the quantity and diversity of proteins a person eats from plant and animal sources might affect their hypertension risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data for 2,294 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who filled out a 120-item questionnaire about the foods they ate. Participants also indicated they had no history of high blood pressure. They were an average 58 years old at the start of the study and were followed for up to 18 years, with a median follow-up of almost nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants reported eating an average of 68 grams per day of protein, with about 24 grams coming from plant sources and the rest coming from animals. On average, participants consumed nine different types of protein per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no strong evidence to support a link between animal protein intake and high blood pressure risk. But they did find that the more plant-based proteins a person ate, the lower their risk for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every 20 grams of plant-based protein consumed each day, the risk for hypertension decreased by 16% compared to those who ate the fewest plant foods. Those benefits leveled out once a person consumed 30 grams of plant-based protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eating a broader range of plant protein sources ended up increasing high blood pressure risk among the participants. While the study did not investigate why, Otto said the findings indicate that participants who consumed a broader range of plant protein sources may include highly processed plant-based options in their diet, which could increase the risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their eating patterns started to move toward less healthy plant protein options,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of protein found in plants and animals varies. For example, 3 ounces of light tuna fish canned in water has almost 22 grams of protein, 1 cup of store-bought hummus has 19 grams, and 1 cup of boiled lima beans has 15 grams. According to the American Heart Association, which funded the new study, good sources of plant-based protein include beans and legumes, chickpeas, lentils, edamame, nut butter, oats, quinoa, nuts and seeds, tofu and soy milk. These whole foods also contain high levels of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think in many ways this study reaffirms things we already knew,” said Dr. Matthew Landry, an assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the findings underscore the importance of choosing those plant proteins wisely, Landry said. He was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to plant-based proteins, it’s important to choose whole food sources, he said. “People should focus on more minimally processed proteins rather than the highly processed ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Landry said, “a very simple plant-based protein like tofu is very different from a burger made from meat alternatives. Both contain plant proteins, but they undergo different levels of processing,” meaning they can have different amounts of sodium, saturated fat and other additives. “You can’t just lump them under the same ‘healthy’ umbrella,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that this orexin receptor antagonist not only restored healthier sleep patterns but also preserved brain structure and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with lemborexant had up to 40% greater hippocampal volume than untreated controls or those given a different sleep aid. Importantly, these neuroprotective effects were seen only in male mice, which may reflect sex differences in tau pathology severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotection:&lt;/strong&gt; Lemborexant reduced tau accumulation and brain cell death in male mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Only sleep aids blocking orexin receptors, like lemborexant, showed benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated mice had significantly larger hippocampal volumes, a region key to memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common sleep aid restores healthier sleep patterns and protects mice from the brain damage seen in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, lemborexant, prevents the harmful buildup of an abnormal form of a protein called tau in the brain, reducing the inflammatory brain damage tau is known to cause in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that lemborexant and other drugs that work in the same way could help treat or prevent the damage caused by tau in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome and some frontotemporal dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published May 27 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have known for a long time that sleep loss is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,” said senior author David M. Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this new study, we have shown that lemborexant improves sleep and reduces abnormal tau, which appears to be a main driver of the neurological damage that we see in Alzheimer’s and several related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are hopeful this finding will lead to further studies of this sleep medication and the development of new therapeutics that may be more effective than current options either alone or in combination with other available treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The antibodies to amyloid that we now use to treat patients with early, mild Alzheimer’s dementia are helpful, but they don’t slow the disease down as much as we would like,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need ways to reduce the abnormal tau buildup and its accompanying inflammation, and this type of sleep aid is worth looking at further. We are interested in whether going after both amyloid and tau with a combination of therapies could be more effective at slowing or stopping the progression of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman and his team were among the first to identify the connection between poor sleep as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and the buildup of proteins such as amyloid and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past work studying mice genetically prone to amyloid and tau buildup characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, they showed that sleep deprivation makes this buildup worse. Improving sleep in these mice with lemborexant appeared to be protective, the latest study showed, with less buildup of tau protein tangles and less nerve cell death associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein tau accumulates in the brain in multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s, and causes inflammation and the death of brain cells. Holtzman and his team, co-led by first author Samira Parhizkar, PhD, an instructor in neurology, tested lemborexant in part because it has effects in parts of the brain known to be affected by abnormal tau accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does not impair motor coordination, which is a concern for people with dementia taking hypnotic sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant is one of three sleep drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration that inhibit the effect of orexins, small proteins that regulate sleep, by acting as orexin receptor antagonists. Lemborexant blocks both orexin receptors (type 1 and type 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receptors are proteins on the cell surface that bind to other molecules and regulate cell activity. These receptors are known to play important roles in sleep-wake cycles and appetite, among other physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical company Eisai provided lemborexant for these studies as part of a research collaboration with WashU Medicine focused on developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically prone to harmful tau buildup, lemborexant reduced brain damage compared with control mice. For example, those receiving lemborexant showed 30% to 40% larger volume in the hippocampus — a part of the brain important for forming memories — compared with control mice and those receiving a different sleep drug, zolpidem, which belongs to a different class of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zolpidem increased sleep but had none of the protective effects against tau accumulation in the brain that were seen with lemborexant, suggesting that the type of sleep aid — orexin receptor antagonist — is key in producing the neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the beneficial effects were only seen in male mice, which they are still working to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal tau is important in maintaining the structure and function of neurons. When healthy, it carries a small number of chemical tags called phosphate groups. But when tau picks up too many of these chemical tags, it can clump together, leading to inflammation and nerve cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found that by blocking orexin receptors, lemborexant prevents excess tags from being added to tau, helping tau maintain its healthy roles in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman said his team is continuing to explore the reasons lemborexant treatment’s neuroprotective effects were seen only in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He speculated that the sex discrepancy could be due to the observation that female mice with the same genetic predisposition to tau accumulation developed less-severe neurodegeneration compared with male mice. With less damage to begin with, potential beneficial effects of the drug could have been smaller and more difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P01NS074969, RF1NS090934 and RF1AG061776; the JPB Foundation; the Alzheimer’s Association, grant number AARF-21-850865; the Rainwater Foundation, and a COBRAS Feldman Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman is an inventor on a patent licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics on the therapeutic use of anti-tau antibodies.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly educated night owls showed significant cognitive decline over 10 years, while those with less education were unaffected regardless of sleep preferences&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The problem stems from rigid work schedules forcing night owls into chronic “social jetlag,” creating constant conflict with their natural sleep rhythms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Poor sleep quality and smoking habits explained about 25% of the brain fog connection, suggesting targeted interventions could help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRONINGEN, Netherlands —&lt;/strong&gt; Your natural sleep schedule might be quietly damaging your brain, but only if you fall into a specific category of people. A decade-long study of nearly 24,000 adults has uncovered a troubling connection between being a night owl and cognitive decline — with a surprising twist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-education-factor-changes-everything"&gt;The Education Factor Changes Everything&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Groningen followed participants for 10 years and discovered that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-owls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;night owls&lt;/a&gt; experienced significantly more cognitive decline than early birds. That aforementioned twist? People with less education showed no such pattern, regardless of their sleep preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among college-educated participants, each hour shift toward being a night owl was associated with a 0.80-point decline in cognitive test scores over the decade. For someone with the most extreme late sleep schedule compared to an early riser, this translates to measurable differences in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-boosts-memory-24-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental sharpness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your chronotype is simply your body’s natural preference for when to sleep and wake up. It’s controlled by your &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/circadian-rhythm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, that internal 24-hour clock that regulates everything from body temperature to hormone production. About 20% of adults naturally prefer late bedtimes during midlife, while only 7% are extreme early birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education connection appears to be about job flexibility. Highly educated people typically work rigid 9-to-5 office jobs. Executives, managers, teachers, and other professionals with strict morning schedules have little room for natural sleep preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with less formal education often have more varied work schedules. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/construction-workers-suicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Construction workers&lt;/a&gt; might start early, bartenders work nights, and service workers frequently have shifting schedules that could better match their natural sleep timing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When your job forces you to wake up much earlier than your body wants, you experience what researchers call “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/social-jet-lag-sleep-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;social jet lag&lt;/a&gt;” — essentially chronic biological jet lag. Highly educated night owls may experience this more intensely because they have less control over their work schedules, constantly battling their natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Children are morning people. That changes when you reach puberty, when you become an evening person,” says lead author Ana Wenzler in a statement. “Around your 20s, that gradually shifts back towards morning people for most people. By the age of 40, most people are morning people again. But this is certainly not the case for everyone. In this way, evening people deviate from the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-quality-and-smoking-explain-the-damage"&gt;Sleep Quality and Smoking Explain the Damage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S227458072500113X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  identified two key factors behind the cognitive decline: poor sleep quality and smoking habits. Among highly educated participants, these factors accounted for about one-third of the connection between being a night owl and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Night owls reported worse &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lottery-sleep-quality-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, which makes sense. If your body wants to stay up until 2 a.m. but you must wake at 6 a.m. for work, you’re chronically sleep-deprived. Poor sleep hampers the brain’s ability to clear waste products, including proteins associated with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoking played a surprisingly large role, explaining about 19% of the cognitive decline. Night owls were more likely to smoke, possibly because nicotine provides short-term mental sharpness that helps them cope with the mismatch between their biological clock and work demands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption and physical activity levels didn’t explain the cognitive decline, even though night owls showed different patterns in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-millions-of-americans"&gt;What This Means for Millions of Americans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About one in five American adults naturally prefer late sleep schedules, meaning millions could be affected, particularly those in professional careers demanding early starts. The study measured &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; using tests of executive function and problem-solving skills that are important for planning and adapting to new situations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While researchers can’t definitively say this decline leads to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dementia/"&gt;dementi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;, any measurable drop in cognitive function over a decade raises concerns. However, understanding these mechanisms could lead to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flexible work schedules might particularly benefit highly educated night owls. Companies allowing later start times for employees whose biology favors evening hours could actually protect their workers’ long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Targeted sleep improvement and smoking cessation programs &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-owls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for night owls&lt;/a&gt; in demanding careers could also help. Since sleep quality and smoking explained 25% of the cognitive decline, addressing these factors could make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve published numerous studies on just how important sleep is when it comes to your body’s ability to function optimally. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natural sleep preferences&lt;/a&gt; might have real consequences for brain health, depending on how well your lifestyle fits your biological clock. If you’re a highly educated night owl stuck in an &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/early-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early-bird&lt;/a&gt; work world, you might be paying a cognitive price that builds up over decades. The solution isn’t forcing yourself to become a morning person, but finding ways to work with your natural rhythms or reduce the harm from constantly fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 23,798 adults aged 40 and older from the Lifelines cohort study in the Netherlands over approximately 10 years. Participants completed the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire to determine their natural sleep-wake preferences and took the Ruff Figural Fluency Test to measure cognitive function at the beginning and end of the study. The researchers used statistical methods to examine relationships between chronotype and cognitive decline, testing whether factors like education, sleep quality, alcohol intake, physical activity, and smoking explained any connections they found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among highly educated participants, each one-hour shift toward being a night owl was associated with a 0.80-point decline in cognitive test scores over 10 years. No associations were found in low or middle education groups. Poor sleep quality mediated 13.5% of this association, while current smoking explained 18.6%. The combined effect of all measured factors accounted for about 25% of the total relationship between chronotype and cognitive decline in the highly educated group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only measured cognitive function twice over the decade, and focused specifically on executive function rather than other cognitive domains like memory. Participants who dropped out of the study had lower baseline cognitive scores, potentially affecting results. The cognitive tests were administered at different times of day without recording when, which could affect performance since night owls typically perform worse in morning hours. The study also couldn’t definitively separate the effects of chronotype itself from social jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;

When she arrived with Jordan to drop him off, I noticed he was rubbing his eyes. In response to my asking if he was upset, Megan said he’d gotten some shampoo in his eyes when she’d washed his hair and joked about Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson being anything but tear-free. But it turns out Megan was hiding something major from us…&lt;/p&gt;

I think she knew damn well what was going on with her son and that no babysitter would be willing to watch a kid with an eye infection and didn’t want to cancel taking the dog to the vet (it wasn’t for anything serious, just some vaccines). After this, I am no longer willing to watch Jordan until he’s past daycare age, when he’ll be less likely to be harboring things like this.&lt;br&gt;My husband says I’m being unreasonable. Considering we all had to go through a week of eye drops and both my husband and I had to use up sick days because we were contagious, I don’t think I am. Who’s right?&lt;/p&gt;

Is there some complicated history between you and Megan, something that led to suspicion or bad feelings preceding this incident? It seems like you’re assuming bad faith on her part where others, like your husband, might not—but maybe she’s given you some reason not to trust her.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb8i5gen002r3576ibgamxd7@published"&gt;Pinkeye or no, if you don’t want to provide childcare for family members, there’s no rule saying you have to. But you might be in for an awkward conversation about why you’re unwilling to babysit going forward. There might be some hard feelings, and naturally you also couldn’t expect any childcare help from your in-laws. Maybe you’re totally fine with all those consequences! But given that this is your husband’s family and he might not be, the two of you may need to talk some more to try to get on the same page. (It is an option for him to continue to watch Jordan on occasion, even if you don’t want to, but of course it would probably still be at your house.)&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s very possible to not know that someone has caught something until after someone else has been exposed. We all catch germs from family members and friends and their kids—it’s part of having other people in our lives. You and/or your kids have probably also passed along viruses that infected someone else, before you knew that you were contagious; I imagine you wouldn’t want those people assuming you did so deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study tracked nearly 500 individuals from age 21 to 89 over three timepoints using brain scans, cognitive tests, and health surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings highlight that aging follows diverse neurological paths, with no single cause behind cognitive decline. The open-access data allows researchers worldwide to explore the biology of healthy aging and early decline more deeply than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longitudinal Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The study followed the same individuals across 10 years—rare in brain aging research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Included MRI, PET scans, cognitive testing, and health indicators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The full dataset is now available for global scientific use and hypothesis testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers from The University of Texas at Dallas’ Center for Vital Longevity (CVL) have released the full dataset from a decade-long project designed to track brain and cognitive health as people age and distinguish neurologically healthy paths from those indicating a likelihood of decline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) combined brain and cognition measures across the adult lifetime, including an expansive range of imaging and tests at three points across 10 years in nearly 500 individual healthy peoples’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110442"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-aging-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wig said the study was innovative in its inclusion of middle-aged participants, early adoption of brain scans that allowed measurement of brain networks and its gathering of PET data from a cognitively normal sample. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article published on May 26 in &lt;em&gt;Nature’s Scientific Data&lt;/em&gt; provides an overview of the project and outlines its significance, which includes data collected from 2008 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Denise Park, Distinguished University Chair in Behavioral and Brain Sciences and Director of Research at CVL, is the originator of the project. She said that one can think of the brain as an orchestra playing, with different parts becoming important in various phases of a composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This repository allows us to see the brain all at once,” Park said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Releasing this data will allow the exploration of and characterization of how the brain changes in many different facets as we age. You can learn one thing from white matter, another from gray matter, and another from neuron activation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gagan Wig, co-corresponding author of the article and an associate professor of psychology in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, said, “We have been using this dataset to study trajectories of aging across adulthood, including middle age, which has been understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DLBS has been allowing us to identify individual characteristics that predict cognitive decline and disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DLBS was launched with a Method to Extend Research in Time (MERIT) Award (&lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/KUubs56-_UiISAszac9IuA/project-details/7533152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;R37&lt;/a&gt;) to Park from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health, that provided long-term funding, in this case for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That allowed the team to devote its time entirely to gathering data without the need to publish results within an early time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DLBS assessed 464 initial participants age 21 to 89; 338 returned for a second assessment three to five years later, and 224 underwent a third data collection after another similar interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having three timepoints is a rarity among studies of brain aging across adulthood,” Wig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So often, studies of aging are based on cross-sectional comparisons of younger and older people, not looking at the same individuals followed over time. Longitudinal testing is critical for understanding how and why individuals age the way they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each evaluation included a comprehensive neuropsychological battery; questionnaires assessing physical and neurological health; a wide range of imaging scans, including structural and functional MRIs; and measures of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain via positron-emission tomography (PET) scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wig said the study was innovative in its inclusion of middle-aged participants, early adoption of brain scans that allowed measurement of brain networks and its gathering of PET data from a cognitively normal sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant findings that have come from the DLBS data include demonstrations of brain network breakdown that are evident across the lifespan and descriptions of the presence of high levels of amyloid in healthy adults, discoveries that have subsequently been verified in further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding healthy adults who had amyloid burden was the first clue that amyloid might not be sufficient for cognitive impairment,” Wig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since then, some efforts to clear amyloid from the brain have been successful, but there have been mixed results in terms of deterring further cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now believe that amyloid is a precipitating factor for the aggregation of tau tangles, which are an additional signature of Alzheimer’s disease. The most recent wave of DLBS contains data that is allowing researchers to examine tau in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The availability of this valuable data is allowing scientists to evaluate and refine dominant models of disease and cognitive aging,” Wig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park views the causes of cognitive decline as pieces in a puzzle that can be different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have heavily degraded white matter that causes issues. Others have problems with activation or brain shrinkage. No two people are alike,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t point to any single pattern. But we’re heading toward being able to understand why certain people are in decline, and we’re learning more about potential causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open-access data provides the opportunity for researchers worldwide to test hypotheses about brain and cognition across adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the CVL and other scientists have already published extensively based on this data, Park said those publications have only scratched the surface in terms of what this information can reveal about the cognitive neuroscience of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The publication of our open repository will allow the data to be more broadly accessible in the neuroscience, medical and psychological communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond cognition measures, the dataset also contains a large number of surveys and instruments measuring specific health indicators, behavior and personality in individuals across adulthood,” Wig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team plans to continue to mine this dataset for years as we try to understand individual trajectories of cognitive health, and we’re excited for others to more easily do so as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Park approached her retirement this year, she faced an important choice: to devote several years to preparing the volumes of data to be shared with the world, or to focus on continuing to publish papers based on the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I decided the best use of my time was to invest in this discipline by sharing the data with the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I take a lot of pride in the fact that we completed this in an elegant manner. The data is very easy for people to use if they come in with a hypothesis. I view that as a bigger contribution to science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park said she hopes the legacy of the repository will be to provide the field of neuroscience with more questions to explore and the means to explore them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel vindicated. I spent a decade of my career on this project, and I worried that maybe I was chasing something that would not prove to be truly important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data appearing in this publication will continue to have an impact, to pose questions for others to solve — and I’m sure they will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other UT Dallas-affiliated authors include psychology professors Dr. Kristen Kennedy and Dr. Karen Rodrigue; former CVL research scientist Dr. Joseph P.

Participants (n = 464) were between age 21 and 89 years at time of first assessment and returned approximately every 3.5–5 years for a second (n = 338) and third epoch (n = 224) of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three epochs included a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, questionnaires that assessed physical health, psychosocial status, and brain health, structural MRI scans (including T1-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging), a hypercapnia scan, an arterial spin labeling scan, and four functional fMRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, measures of amyloid and tau were collected with AV-45 (Florbetapir) and AV-1451 (Flortaucipir). Key innovations were robust sampling of middle-aged participants and inclusion of PET data for amyloid and tau in a cognitively normal sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This large data set has recently been published on OpenNeuro.org open-access and provides the opportunity for researchers to test many hypotheses about brain and cognition across human adulthood, including longitudinal hypotheses, with these data across a multi-year span.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 12:59:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE1QZzFOZ3U1Y3Flbi1kOHhzQzJnQTNTZ254R0xRWU1GbmNlNkxEYnpYV3h0VFBrNENIQXN4c2tZcElXRVdEdE5Sb1YwVmIySXR3d0cyU25BVFVpS2ZpR0VGRHlwbWtBZw</guid></item><item><title>自闭症与早发性帕金森病风险之间的联系-神经科学新闻 | Link Found Between Autism and Early-Onset Parkinson’s Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1NTnVkaklOaUc0S1djd25tU1BWdFJoYmlDMmpQdTJHM2tYMDdNR1JoZWZDTHJGUVZUUzhaN3BNd2kyVEI4YzFheVBIc3ZuUXF6anpWVlE3bGhiZXV2OGhTNGU3OHAyakdMdWdTMjJxdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large-scale Swedish study has found that individuals with autism are at significantly higher risk of developing early-onset Parkinson’s disease. Researchers followed over two million people and discovered that those with autism were four times more likely to develop the neurodegenerative condition before age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection may stem from shared disruptions in dopamine-related brain systems involved in both movement and social behavior. Even after adjusting for factors like medication use and mental illness, the risk remained notably elevated, suggesting a potential biological overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Autistic individuals are four times more likely to develop early-onset Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine system dysfunction may underlie both conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Association:&lt;/strong&gt; Risk remains doubled even after accounting for medication and mental health factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with an autism diagnosis are at a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease early in life, a large-scale study from Karolinska Institutet published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology &lt;/em&gt;reports. The researchers believe that the two conditions can share underlying biological mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is based on registry data from over two million people born in Sweden between 1974 and 1999 who were followed from the age of 20 up to the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110438"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We hope that our results will eventually help to bring greater clarity to the underlying causes of both ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says Dr Yin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers interrogated a possible connection between the neuropsychiatric diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which affects an individual’s thought processes, behaviour and interpersonal communication, and early-onset Parkinson’s disease, a condition that affects locomotion and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine can be involved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that people with an autism diagnosis were four times more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease than people without such a diagnosis, a correlation that remained when controlling for socioeconomic status, a genetic predisposition for mental illness or Parkinson’s disease and other such factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that there can be shared biological drivers behind ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says the study’s first author Weiyao Yin, researcher at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One hypothesis is that the brain’s dopamine system is affected in both cases, since the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important part in social behaviour and motion control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well-known that dopamine-producing neurons are degraded in Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies have also shown that dopamine is possibly implicated in autism, but more research needs to be done to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that our results will eventually help to bring greater clarity to the underlying causes of both ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says Dr Yin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical checkups are vital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and the use of antidepressants are common in people with autism, as are antipsychotic drugs, which are known for being able to cause Parkinson’s-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers adjusted for these factors, the correlation between ASD and the later development of Parkinson’s disease was less salient, but the risk was still double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that they only analysed early-onset Parkinson’s disease before the age of 50 and that the average age of participants by the end of the study was 34. The incidence of Parkinson’s disease was therefore very low. Future studies will need to examine if the elevated risk persists into older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthcare services need to keep people with ASD – a vulnerable group with high co-morbidity and a high use of psychotropics – under long-term observation,” says the study’s last author Sven Sandin, statistician and epidemiologist at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it’s important to remember that a Parkinson’s diagnosis before the age of 50 is very rare, including for people with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was primarily financed by the Simons Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the authors have declared funding and fees from pharmaceutical companies unconnected to the study.

Nonetheless, large longitudinal studies examining the risk of PD following ASD are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between ASD and future PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nationwide population-based prospective cohort study was performed using data from Swedish national registers. All individuals born in Sweden from 1974 to 1999 with follow-up from age 20 years until December 31, 2022, and with complete covariate data were included. The analysis was completed in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses of ASD as a time-varying exposure obtained from the National Patient Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses of PD were obtained from the National Patient Register through 2022. The relative risk (RR) of PD was quantified using incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs from Poisson regression. Preterm birth, depression, antidepressant use, and antipsychotic exposure over time were potentially modifying life events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 2 278 565 individuals (median [IQR] age at exit, 34 [29-42] years; 1 106 772 female [48.6%]), contributing 33 858 476 person-years. PD occurred in 438 of 2 226 611 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 cases/100 000 person-years) and 24 of 51 954 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 cases/100 000 person-years) (RR, 4.43 [95% CI, 2.92-6.72]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk estimates were similar after adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, family history of mental illness, family history of PD, and age at ASD diagnosis. Preterm or early-term birth was not associated with and did not modify the PD risk. Depression and antidepressant use (present in 24 257 individuals with ASD [46.7%]) were associated with increased risk of PD (RR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.40-2.88]), independent of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotic exposure (present in 16 387 individuals with ASD [31.5%]) reduced but did not fully attenuate the association (RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.27-3.14]) and showed no interaction with ASD on PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASD was associated with increased risk of PD, even after adjusting for depression or antidepressant use and antipsychotic exposure. These findings suggest a potential shared etiology between neurodevelopmental disorders and PD, and a heightened awareness of long-term neurological conditions in individuals with ASD may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 12:42:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1NTnVkaklOaUc0S1djd25tU1BWdFJoYmlDMmpQdTJHM2tYMDdNR1JoZWZDTHJGUVZUUzhaN3BNd2kyVEI4YzFheVBIc3ZuUXF6anpWVlE3bGhiZXV2OGhTNGU3OHAyakdMdWdTMjJxdw</guid></item><item><title>旧金山卫生部门提供的70美元旅行诀窍可以挽救您的生命- SFGATE | $70 travel hack from SF health department could save your life - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPR1BLRWhPZmlCNklXVHJUNS1xNmk5b0t6ODNFWXZvNFdyM0l1LUxGWVZsV0FGT05jZE5LYWt0NWs3TzREOXB0cHVlNmdVVEgyMVhNWjA0eThaR0haVmtVQ0JuUkdoeUYyTWt3ZzU1d2Q5eFFnWG15bDJnQ1FsVGVadjVHQTdxaThoVkNCOVA5WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Knowing the root cause as well as some doctor-recommended tips for what to do when it happens can make heartburn a lot less likely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Exactly Is Heartburn, Anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before getting into how to avoid heartburn, it’s helpful to know what is actually happening in the body to cause it. “Heartburn happens when stomach acid moves up into the esophagus, the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-vivek-lal-md-faap-20183913/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Vivek Lal, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-vivek-lal-md-faap-20183913/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Vivek Lal, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a microbiome scientist and founder of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresbiotic.com%2F" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Resbiotic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresbiotic.com%2F" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resbiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He explained that this usually occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle that acts like a valve, relaxes or is weakened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-mikhail-yakubov/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mikhail Yakubov, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-mikhail-yakubov/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Mikhail Yakubov, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a gastroenterologist with Manhattan Gastroenterology, told HuffPost that heartburn feels like an uncomfortable burning sensation in your chest (hence its name) and it usually occurs after eating. Similar to Lal, he explained that, normally, the lower esophageal sphincter acts like a gate to keep acid where it belongs. But if it relaxes too much or becomes weak, acid can sneak back up, leading to heartburn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Reasons Heartburn Is More Common With Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Esophageal Muscles Weaken Over Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yakubov shared that one major reason why heartburn becomes more common the older we get is because the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120791/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="esophageal muscles weaken over time" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120791/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;esophageal muscles weaken over time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is something that naturally happens with age. Remember how he explained that it’s the lower esophageal spincter’s job to keep acid where it belongs and not sneak back up your throat? The weaker this muscle becomes, the worse of a job it does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, Yakubov said that the digestive system slows down as we get older. He explained that this means there’s more time for acid to move in the wrong direction. Together, it’s a double whammy that can make heartburn more common.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Certain Medications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The likelihood of developing high blood pressure increases with age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, 52.5% of adults between 40 and 59 and 71.6% of adults 60 and older have high blood pressure. While taking blood pressure medication is an important part of treatment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/ali-farhad-kazemi-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ali Kazemi, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/ali-farhad-kazemi-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ali Kazemi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a gastroenterologist with Gastro Health, told HuffPost that these medications (specifically nitrates and calcium channel blockers) can make experiencing heartburn more likely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kazemi shared that erectile dysfunction medication can also have heartburn as a side effect and it’s a medication that is more commonly prescribed to older people (in this case, men). Lal added that besides these medications, certain antibiotics, opioids and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or aspirin can contribute to heartburn. While these medications are used by people of all ages, it’s important to know they could be a culprit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;You may find that certain meals you used to have no problem with — like pizza or a spicy curry — now mean having to knock back an antacid after you eat. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Weight Gain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve gained some weight as you’ve gotten older, you’re not alone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9374375" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Between the ages of 40 and 66" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681533cae4b0c553a15ccd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9374375" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between the ages of 40 and 66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, both men and women gain an average of between a half pound to one pound a year. All three doctors told HuffPost that there’s a link between weight gain and heartburn. “It’s believed that a larger waist circumference leads to increased pressure within the abdomen and stomach, which promotes reflux,” Kazemi said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On top of that, Kazemi said that obesity is linked to slower digestion. The slower food is digested, the more time it has to cause heartburn. “Recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists used for diabetes and weight loss like Ozempic and Mounjaro have also been associated with reflux due to their effect of delaying gastric emptying,” Kazemi added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Do If You Get Heartburn Regularly &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that you know what causes heartburn and why it’s more common with age comes the big question: How do you get rid of it? After all, there isn’t much you can do about your esophageal muscles weakening over time; it just happens. Here’s the good news: All three doctors said that having some specific habits in place can make heartburn less likely — no matter how old you are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, if you are taking any of the previously mentioned medications that are linked to heartburn, it’s worth it to talk to your primary care doctor about potentially switching to another drug. Both Yakubov and Kazemi said that doing what you can to maintain a healthy weight can make heartburn less likely, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Got that covered? All three doctors emphasize the importance of identifying your triggers. “Common culprits include spicy foods, coffee, citrus, chocolate and alcohol. Try removing these for at least two weeks, then reintroduce them one at a time to help pinpoint what’s causing symptoms,” Lal said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lal added that something else that can help is eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large portions. This, he explained, will reduce pressure on the stomach because it won’t be as full. All three doctors recommend eating your last meal at least two hours before going to bed. When you do go to bed, Kazemi said it can be helpful to prop your upper body up 30 degrees using a pillow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Kazemi and Yakubov both told HuffPost that there are medications that can help with heartburn, but it’s best to try to treat it with lifestyle modifications first. “The key thing I always tell patients is not to ignore persistent symptoms. Heartburn is common, but if it’s frequent or severe, it could be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease or something more serious. Getting evaluated helps rule out complications and keeps you feeling your best,” Yakubov added. In other words, take your symptoms seriously; don’t just attempt to live with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The key to avoiding heartburn with age comes down to being a bit more mindful. It’s another way that having healthy habits in place can pay off. And remember, if you need help, ask for it. You deserve to enjoy your favorite foods pain-free — no matter how old you are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 11:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQQU9yZzhCcTVwMGgxd09iNm5GX1laclZ6QkRzQklqLUswakN6QTRNMEo5d0ZHWjM5dGVHZG9FVHMxQTdYSkotLUFYX0xMTlJTeE5EU2xlUWdxZ3hUU285dWFpUWhCcmJ5NFJ0MDFvY1otUEphUzBOSUtwOGtOZFZCc1drcTJXX0hOTXducktTWkU3OVk2YWdWZFhheHRNMTFjNlZUVjVR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBLbWRlZVUxS25ueWcyMjlGVzdkSXN4VUJTXzFaWnhiQ0NnZnlfUWdvSGZXSHRTWjBEd1l0aFVWVWlUZm0tYTJGbzdRS1U0aFlCWndfNlowNHFScG1EU21EWGUtZ0dTRnZITDFRa2xEU3BKcGhtaVJRWElHeGotanlwRlVWWF81bG83bEpxSU1WdHJIOFZsSHIwQ3NteF9hWFlpUjBma3Bzc3lNVQ</guid></item><item><title>随着RFK Jr.发布令人担忧的反疫苗声明，俄亥俄州恢复了COVID仪表板- Cleveland.com | Ohio revives COVID dashboard as RFK Jr. makes alarming anti-vaccine declarations - Cleveland.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RR4ZYRIHYFH4BODIWRTUJ2SULE"&gt;In a healthcare landscape increasingly dominated by politics rather than science, Ohio is taking a data-driven approach by revamping its COVID dashboard – just as controversial health policy declarations from Robert F.

And he just blew it apart and said, I’m telling you, no pregnant women, no kids. It’s ridiculous. People are going to get sick as a result of this because we have a vaccine wacko at the top of our government determining you won’t be able to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UUXQ5OPGBBEYXKYOXR7COTVOFI"&gt;Quinn highlighted the dangerous convergence of politics and public health, where established scientific review processes are being bypassed in favor of politically-expedient declarations. The result is an environment where individual health choices become increasingly politicized rather than medically informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K43Z65J7URFVBNZIRVDMZGOFP4"&gt;Ohio’s dashboard provides a counterweight to the trend by focusing on real-time data rather than rhetoric. The system updates hospitalization figures weekly, providing county-by-county breakdowns that help Ohioans understand actual virus circulation in their communities. For the week ending May 22, the dashboard showed 96 COVID-related hospitalizations statewide, down from 130 the previous week, with Cuyahoga County reporting 18 cases compared to 20 the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XMGQSSYCYJAVNENQTQCQ4CI62E"&gt;This emphasis on transparent, accessible data becomes more important as public health guidance grows increasingly fractured along political lines. By creating a single source of reliable information covering multiple respiratory illnesses, Ohio is helping residents make informed health decisions based on current conditions in their specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WSLABLNGRRAERBHAFJQKUDCNEQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/79xE6UlAGErncvGiuEDQZo?si=2f4d22e900ba4073" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://open.spotify.com/episode/79xE6UlAGErncvGiuEDQZo?si=2f4d22e900ba4073"&gt;Listen to the discussion here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3DABTPTG45DDHP27KDUQ53GF2E"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Artificial intelligence was used to help generate this story from Today in Ohio, a news podcast discussion by cleveland.com editors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease name: &lt;/strong&gt;Moebius syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected populations:&lt;/strong&gt; The exact incidence of Moebius syndrome is unknown. A 2021 survey in Italy suggested that the condition affects &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-021-01808-2" target="_blank" data-url="https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-021-01808-2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;0.3 in 100,000 newborns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the country, while a 1996 Dutch study estimated that it affects about 2.1 per 100,000 newborns in The Netherlands. Other studies estimate that, worldwide, between 1 in 500,000 and 1 in 50,000 babies are born with the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These estimates may vary because the diagnostic criteria for Moebius syndrome have changed over time. Plus, due to the condition's rarity, countries don't maintain national registries to track its incidence and physicians often lack knowledge of the condition, complicating diagnosis, the authors of the Italian study suggested. The syndrome is thought to occur in people of all races and ethnicities and to affect males and females &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://moebiussyndrome.org/what-is-moebius-syndrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://moebiussyndrome.org/what-is-moebius-syndrome/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;at equal rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes: &lt;/strong&gt;The key feature of Moebius syndrome is the absence or underdevelopment of two sets of cranial nerves (CN): the abducens nerves (CN VI) and facial nerves (CN VII).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21998-cranial-nerves" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21998-cranial-nerves" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 pairs of cranial nerves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in total, and they relay signals from the brain to different parts of the face, head, neck and torso. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/abducens-nerve" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/abducens-nerve" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;abducens nerves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; control the muscles that move the eyes away from the centerline of the face, moving the left eye left and right eye right. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22218-facial-nerve" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22218-facial-nerve" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;facial nerves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; control various movements in the face, such as blinking, scrunching the forehead, smiling and frowning; they also relay sensory signals related to hearing and taste and help control the saliva and tear glands. Depending on the patient, Moebius syndrome may be associated with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2004-823122" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2004-823122" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;problems in other cranial nerves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to CN VI and VII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact causes of these cranial nerve problems in Moebius syndrome are not well understood. Most cases are sporadic, meaning they occur randomly rather than running in families. However, in a small percentage of cases, the syndrome appears to run in families, but the pattern of inheritance isn't consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have pinpointed mutations in certain genes that may contribute to at least some cases of the disorder. These genes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1062930371256769578&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms8199&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmoebius-syndrome-the-rare-condition-that-makes-people-unable-to-smile" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8199" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms8199&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmoebius-syndrome-the-rare-condition-that-makes-people-unable-to-smile" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include PLXND1 and REV3L&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which respectively contribute to brain development in the womb and DNA repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-g8ENrbW76N3gUVcA5exiHG" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-g8ENrbW76N3gUVcA5exiHG slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of Moebius syndrome has also been linked to exposure to certain drugs in the womb. These &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/138834/20230321-10942-hfmhvt.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/138834/20230321-10942-hfmhvt.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;substances include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alcohol, cocaine, benzodiazepines, the immunosuppressant thalidomide and the migraine medication ergotamine. Many researchers think that the syndrome may emerge due to disruptions in blood flow to the brainstem during early stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; The symptoms of Moebius syndrome can vary from person to person. That said, to be diagnosed patients generally have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/moebius-syndrome/#symptoms" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/moebius-syndrome/#symptoms" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the following characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: facial paralysis or weakness affecting at least one side of the face and an inability to do sideways eye movements while still being able to look up and down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with the syndrome may drool more than is typical, have crossed eyes and need to move their whole head to track objects along a horizontal path. They typically show no facial expressions, which is very apparent when they're laughing or crying. They also often have trouble feeding as their suckling and swallowing abilities are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional symptoms seen in some people with Moebius syndrome are having a small jaw and short tongue. Some have cleft palates, abnormalities in the structure of the external ear, or hearing loss, if CN VIII is affected. Some have limb differences, such as clubbed feet or webbed fingers. Many experience delays in developing motor skills, such as crawling, but then catch up later in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, research tied the syndrome to an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder, but that link has been questioned in recent years. It's thought that patients may have been misdiagnosed as autistic due to differences stemming from nerve palsy — such as speech delay and an inability to make facial expressions — that make social interactions more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With treatment, people with Moebius syndrome typically &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6064-moebius-syndrome#symptoms-and-causes" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6064-moebius-syndrome#symptoms-and-causes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;have normal lifespans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/moebius-syndrome/#therapies" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/moebius-syndrome/#therapies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Treatments and therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Moebius syndrome are tailored around each patient's set of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To restore movement to the face, doctors may recommend procedures that transfer muscles and/or nerves from another part of the body into the affected parts of the face. These include surgeries that can help improve the individual's ability to chew, blink, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/young-boy-moebius-syndrome-smiles-after-surgery" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/young-boy-moebius-syndrome-smiles-after-surgery" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;smile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and execute &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/facial-reanimation-surgery/about/pac-20556545" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/facial-reanimation-surgery/about/pac-20556545" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other facial movements and expressions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In infancy, children with the syndrome &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facialpalsy.org.uk/causesanddiagnoses/moebius-syndrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.facialpalsy.org.uk/causesanddiagnoses/moebius-syndrome/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may need feeding tubes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get adequate nutrition. Because patients have trouble blinking, it's important to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facialpalsy.org.uk/support/patient-guides/dry-eye-advice/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.facialpalsy.org.uk/support/patient-guides/dry-eye-advice/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;keep the eyes lubricated with products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like eye drops and to protect the eyes from sun using sunglasses and widebrimmed hats. Patients with crossed eyes can also undergo surgery to realign the eyeballs, if their alignment doesn't improve on its own as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical and occupational therapy can be helpful for patients with orthopedic abnormalities, as can speech therapy for patients with speech delay. Surgeries or physical supports, such as splints, braces and prostheses, may aid patients with limb differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-g8ENrbW76N3gUVcA5exiHG-o5L4Trq8bk8qxVI8nm4vc9NNaJlcIgJY" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-g8ENrbW76N3gUVcA5exiHG-o5L4Trq8bk8qxVI8nm4vc9NNaJlcIgJY slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the next morning, 30 million people woke up to a new a diagnosis of hypertension. We had a blood pressure epidemic on our hands. The newspapers were full of front-page stories alerting Americans to this new threat. The most erudite and well-respected physicians implored us all to get checked and treated immediately lest we suffer heart attacks, strokes — even death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of numerical epidemics. Once we base our definition of disease on numerical abnormalities, we can change the numbers in a way that expands those who have the disease. This has been occurring in dramatic fashion the past 20 years, especially since Medicare (by congressional decree) relinquished the task of defining normal numbers to specialty medical societies. Hence the American College of Cardiology can change the definition of an abnormal cholesterol reading or abnormal blood pressure reading such that more people will be labeled with a diagnosed disease related to these numbers. Like­wise, the American Society of Nephrology can broaden the defi­nition of what constitutes abnormal kidney function and expand the scope of those now diagnosed with kidney disease. The list goes on and on, from diabetes to dementia to skin cancer; the criteria for being declared sick is rapidly being broadened, instigating epidemics of diseases across the medical horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These fabricated crises affect well more than half the popu­lation and drive a measure-diagnose-treat crusade to eradicate sickness by prescribing medicines, ordering tests, seeing special­ists, and undergoing procedures, all in an effort to normalize errant numbers. We are squandering trillions of dollars, often to the detriment of our patients, merely to push a number across some arbitrary line of what we call “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, treating high blood pressure and high sugars in a measured and patient-centric way has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Helping high-risk people with osteoporosis can similarly improve the lives of people we treat intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when our zeal to fix all numbers transcends the science, when all patients are viewed similarly regardless of their individual risks, when numbers eclipse the meaningful health of those we are treating, and when what constitutes a “normal” value is con­stantly altered to make more people appear sick, we have all the makings of a Flexnerian epidemic, named for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1863593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Abraham Flexner&lt;/a&gt;, whose 1911 &lt;a href="http://archive.carnegiefoundation.org/publications/pdfs/elibrary/Carnegie_Flexner_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Flexner Report&lt;/a&gt; set the standard for American medicine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Flexner and his colleagues insisted on reconstructing health care upon a bedrock of science, they assumed that if you can test someone and determine what is physiologically aberrant in his or her body, you can address that abnormality and perhaps fix it. Science, to the architects of the Flexner Report, is not fickle or subjective; it is measurable and absolute.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But they ignored the malleability of scientific “facts.” Studies can be designed to reach foregone conclusions. Cognitive biases can distort our views of what is medically relevant. Benefits of certain interventions to fix abnormalities can be exaggerated and risks minimized. And the very term “abnormal” is hardly objective since it has to be defined by someone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain organizations — whether the American College of Cardiol­ogy or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — can influence our definition of normal, espe­cially when assessments are based on medical studies that these groups handpick to use as the barometer of normal. These are only as reliable as those who design them, but their influence carries great weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. S reads the Washington Post regularly, and in 2018 he came to see one of us, Andy, about the front-page headline regarding new blood pressure standards. A systolic reading of 140 used to be a nor­mal pressure, but now it was deemed to be 120. This bold dec­laration, which created 30 million new hypertensives overnight, emanated from the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/16/blood-pressure-guidelines/"&gt;SPRINT study&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded that aggres­sive treatment of blood pressure in older people results in a 25 percent decrease in stroke and heart attack, and a 40 percent cut in death. When SPRINT defined what a normal blood pressure was, a hypertension crisis gripped the nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. S graphed his and his mom’s blood pressures over time. At ages 68 and 92, both fit in the category of old as defined by SPRINT, but the study did not look at people as old as his mom. He showed Andy the graphs. “Most of the time, we’re way above 120,” he said. “Mom especially. Her blood pressures seem to be all over the map. We need more medicines, doc. I’m going to see my heart doctor in a couple of weeks, but I’m afraid that if we don’t get the numbers down now we could get a stroke any time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, Mr. S placed great value in the significance of numbers. That’s why he created spreadsheets and graphs whereby he could demonstrate the fluctuations and averages of his and his mom’s numbers. It was crucial information, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The danger of basing a new normal on a single study — and then proclaiming from that study that we have a numerical epidemic that requires aggressive and immediate treatment, as so many doctors and media outlets did — is rife with flaws. The primacy of numerical measurements in diagnosis glosses over salient dif­ferences between people, some of whom might require different normal numerical values than others. It also fails to recognize the harms of treatment and the way that “fixing” one number can affect the body more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SPRINT looked at a few thousand highly screened people, all of whom had severe heart disease, which was not the case with Mr. or Mrs. S. It found that by adding an extra medicine to those with blood pressures over 140 systolic, and getting that pressure below 120, there was substantial improvement in outcome. But what does a 25% &lt;em&gt;relative &lt;/em&gt;reduction in heart attack and a 40% &lt;em&gt;relative &lt;/em&gt;reduction in death actually mean? How many people actually benefited from aggressive blood pressure lower­ing in this very select group?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out, not many: One out of 1,000 people treated aggressively avoided a heart attack or stroke, and two out of 1,000 lived longer by pushing pressures below 120 systolic. But we don’t know how much longer they lived. Not only does the study fail to reveal that fact, it also doesn’t tell us if people live longer because of lower pressure or from some other benefit the add-on medicines might confer in regard to their underlying severe heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Also, though SPRINT claimed to measure adverse outcomes of aggressive treatment, it did not adequately assess the more subjective effects of low blood pressure that we see every day in our offices: dizziness, fatigue, falls, increased confusion, among oth­ers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mrs. S was a perfect example. Her blood pressure fluctuated widely, as is true of many her age, and whenever her heart doctor pushed her pressure too low — usually at the behest of her son — she stayed in bed all day and was very confused. The numbers looked great, but Mrs. S didn’t. Also, lowering the blood pres­sure aggressively triggers other problematic side effects, some of which were seen in SPRINT but largely ignored by those who touted the study’s miraculous findings. There was no mention of the five out of 1,000 people in the treatment group who developed severe kidney disease over the brief trial period, and the 10 out of 1,000 were hospitalized for dangerously low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mrs. S’s kidney function declined with the addition of her new blood pressure medicine. Already she had been given a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, stage 3, something with which 90% of our elderly patients had been labeled ever since the defi­nition of kidney disease changed. None of these people ever get sick or need dialysis; the diagnosis is merely an inconsequential numerical blip that was now defined as an illness. But now Mrs. S believed that she had a disease. Mr. S brought her to a kidney doctor, who performed pages of labs regularly and an occasional X-ray. Until now, her kidney function had stabilized, but sud­denly with the new pressure medicine it bumped up. “We should stop the medicine,” one of us (Andy) told her son. “Her pressure is too low, and her labs look worse. She feels terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mom’s kidney doctor begs to differ,” he said. “She wants mom’s pressures as low as possible, and she is closely monitoring many of mom’s kidney tests to be sure we’re on the right track.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Performing tests is one thing. Interpreting the outcome is another. In the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, William Osler, a Canadian physician, emphasized patient care over numerical testing and research. Through an Oslerian lens we simply cannot declare that there is a “normal” blood pressure below which everyone should fall. Everyone is unique, everyone has their own “normal” number, and it is up to a discerning doctor who understands their patient well to interpret the blood pres­sure reading in a way that makes sense for that particular patient. But Mrs. S’s doctor had one goal in mind: &lt;em&gt;normalize the number&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Mrs. S, soon after her kidney doctor insisted she be put on another pressure pill, she promptly fell down and broke her wrist. “Purely a coincidence,” her son later said. “She tripped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many studies have demonstrated the danger of aggressively lowering blood pressure, some of which, such as a large &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-159-4-201308200-00004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Veterans Administration study&lt;/a&gt;, showed worsening renal function and a higher death rate in people aggressively treated who had under­lying kidney disease, a fact that escaped the notice of those who declared the immediacy of our new hypertension epidemic. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1600177" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published after SPRINT showed an increase of death in people treated aggressively when they did not have severe heart disease, which was the case with Mrs. S and son. This study did not receive much attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osler frequently taught that a doctor cannot simply treat a number; he must treat the patient. Mrs. S feels better with higher blood pressure. Maybe her body is pushing her pressure up to get blood through her many narrow arteries, and by lowering the pressure too much she is putting herself and her organs in danger. Also, her blood pressure is not the same from minute to minute, so how can we possibly gauge what her pressure really is and what it should be? Her son, and her specialty doctors, didn’t care about all of that nuance. They read the guidelines, and they vowed to fix her. After all, this was an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

Its active compound, curcumin, is often hailed as a natural remedy for various ailments, from joint pain to digestive issues. However, recent reports have raised concerns about the safety of turmeric supplements, particularly when consumed in high doses or combined with certain enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been several cases where individuals experienced severe liver damage after taking turmeric supplements. These instances underscore the potential risks associated with overconsumption and the importance of understanding how turmeric interacts with the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, 54 year old Robert Grafton had been taking multiple natural supplements, including turmeric but was then diagnosed with a deadly liver disease. "In early March, the former radiology technologist added something new to his regimen - a turmeric-based liquid supplement. He had seen it advertised for improving liver health on social media. However, a week later, Grafton noticed his urine had turned dark, he felt nauseous, lost his appetite and was constantly itchy," the DailyMail reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tests revealed he has developed drug-induced liver injury. He was taking turmeric pills that contained 2,250 milligrams of curcumin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin (a yellowish pigment produced after red blood cell breakdown) was really high - all the signs of liver failure. I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something. It turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has reported several cases of liver injury linked to turmeric supplements. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;spanning from 2004 to 2022, ten cases were identified, all occurring after 2011, with a notable increase since 2017. Symptoms reported include fatigue, nausea, dark urine, and jaundice. In severe instances, patients required hospitalization, and one case resulted in acute liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use turmeric supplements safely without affecting the liver? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is amazing—no doubt about that. It's been used for centuries for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant powers. But when it comes to popping turmeric supplements, especially in high doses, things can get tricky for your liver. So how do you get the benefits without the risks? Easy—go slow and stay smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, stick to recommended dosages. Just because it’s “natural” doesn’t mean more is better. Most experts say 500–1,000 mg of curcumin per day is enough. Avoid mega doses unless a doctor tells you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, watch out for black pepper extract (piperine). It boosts absorption big time, but it can also increase the risk of liver issues in some people—especially if you’re taking medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, take breaks. You don’t need to be on turmeric every day forever. Try using it in cycles and give your body a rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lastly—don’t mix it with alcohol or other supplements that are hard on the liver. If you’ve got any liver problems or take meds, talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric’s great, but your liver deserves love too. Be smart, go easy, and let turmeric help—not hurt—you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>悲痛欲绝的印第安纳州母亲在8岁的儿子死于致命细菌后警告父母- WTHR | Grieving Indiana mother warns parents after 8-year-old son dies from deadly bacteria - WTHR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNYzlES1JqdkJLYTMySzdaM1VDaUxmMnhPVFNib3J0T19LcHFmUzlUM2RpeV9LQ3Q1Yjk3NHpNc2QxajIwUGFQTEdZSEpMaUpBbzNabkI1dk1tVy01R2dlcFJHT3ZURnBFeDJ2X3pHT19SSjZDTzZnTUJaWm4zeU5nZ2o5bWpyYzdjekQzSmxxeGxEak4wd2lZaHZPRXZRRWdHZnA3aFhMa0h3dkNuaHVkOTlvTWphSFhSb3hJUWJxNmhHRHdoMDBlclJZZ1RtV3VhekFCOVJka0FQMGZZai0zaW4tVENmUEIyRDZTSVpUMVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Ashlee Dahlberg said it all started when her 8-year-old son, Liam, came home from school with a headache in April.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOWELL, Ind. — An &lt;a href="http://wthr.com/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indiana &lt;/a&gt;mother is using her grief to warn other parents about a bacterial infection that killed her son within hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not your typical everyday flu," said Ashlee Dahlberg of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/a&gt;, also known as "H. flu" or "Hib."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it's a bacterium – not a virus – and it's extremely deadly. Most children are vaccinated against it when they're babies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We later found out that he contracted invasive Hib, which is the more aggressive form of Hib. Anybody that contracts it usually dies within 24 hours," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlberg said it all started when her 8-year-old son, Liam, came home from school with a headache in April. By the next morning, he was being rushed to the hospital. Her normally lively child became delirious at some moments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They took him to an MRI. That's when they discovered the amount of bacteria that was covering his brain and spinal cord. Basically at that point in time, there was nothing they could do," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives changed in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would never wish this kind of pain on my worst enemy ever. It's hard. To have sat there and listened to the doctors say, 'You did everything right, there's just nothing we could do,' to lay there with him as they took him off life support, I can feel his little heartbeat fade away — there's no words that can describe that pain."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Yancy is all too familiar with H. flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All the way up to the mid-'70s and early 1980s, it was absolutely devastating. If it didn't kill the children within a very short period of time, it left many of them with significant complications," Yancy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications, Yancy said, pretty much ended when the vaccine was created in 1985. Dahlberg said Liam was vaccinated, but Yancy said the boy most likely contracted H. flu from an unvaccinated person, maybe even another child. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We pretty much had it under control, and we pretty much didn't see that many cases of it. Over the last few years, the immunization rates have continued to fall," Yancy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Dahlberg is urging parents to make sure their children are all properly vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I feel like I have failed my child because I could not protect him from everything that would cause harm," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

HHS Secretary Robert F.

This weight gain, however, is due to an increase in water weight, not fat. A 2019 study trusted Source found that taking 2 grams (g) of creatine daily and exercising twice weekly for 5 weeks helped participants ages 50 years and older lose slightly more body fat than participants who only exercised. A 2023 review found similar results in people younger than 50 years old. Over the long term, creatine users may continue to increase their body weight more than people who don’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this weight gain is due to increased muscle mass, not body fat. Increased muscle mass may especially benefit older adults, individuals with obesity, and those with certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="livtv_and_video_widgt_wrap" data-livetv-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=FP2.0_fact_live" data-featured-video-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-videos-list?fields=title,pg_id,id,mongo_id,sources,duration,created_at,shows.slug,shows.title,author_byline.name,images,weburl&amp;amp;sortBy=created_at&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;count=10&amp;amp;filter=%7b%22shows.slug%22:%22vantage%22,%22video_type%22:%22vod%22%7d" data-event-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=event-switcher" data-category="entertainment" data-env="PROD" data-page-url="www.firstpost.com/entertainment/what-is-creatine-the-supplement-patrick-schwarzeneggers-character-in-the-white-lotus-added-to-his-famous-shake-13892649.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Firstpost</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 03:29:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>您的压力可能是未来痴呆症的隐性诱因- ScienceAlert | Your Stress Could Be a Hidden Trigger For Future Dementia - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQVDdiWUFsdnlyT1ZLY1NDbjFjYU83a19CNTBmc1ZTZXU0ODZKQTlwaXVVam81ajVTekNMSl9vOHp0Z3RLejBDOVUxbXVYXzZPZ2J0LWJyYkVyRmdvc0lpcjhhMmNnX3VXZTFJTVB4YWJ5bldTUnBIOFpralN5NGRkemR4SGRmUXBNNTJuM2Vmbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The probability of any American having dementia in their lifetime may be far greater than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a 2025 study that tracked a large sample of American adults across more than three decades found that their average likelihood of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;developing dementia between ages 55 to 95 was 42 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that figure was even higher among women, Black adults, and those with genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a great deal of attention is being paid to &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/brain-health/cognitive-health-and-older-adults"&gt;how to stave off cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in the aging American population. But what is often missing from this conversation is the role that chronic stress can play in how well people age from a cognitive standpoint, as well as everybody's risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are professors at Penn State in the &lt;a href="https://healthyaging.psu.edu/"&gt;Center for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;, with expertise in &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=wnP42OIAAAAJ&amp;amp;view_op=list_works"&gt;health psychology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=00f7MKUAAAAJ&amp;amp;view_op=list_works"&gt;neuropsychology&lt;/a&gt;. We study the pathways by which chronic psychological stress influences the risk of dementia and how it influences the ability to stay healthy as people age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows that Americans who are currently middle-aged or older report experiencing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000597"&gt;more frequent stressful events&lt;/a&gt; than previous generations. A key driver behind this increase appears to be rising economic and job insecurity, especially in the wake of the 2007-2009 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2018.05.001"&gt;Great Recession&lt;/a&gt; and ongoing shifts in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_117593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117593" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-642x260.jpg" alt="Hand of elderly person counting coins" class="size-medium wp-image-117593" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-117593" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Financial strain can impact health. (Westend61/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people stay in the workforce longer due to financial necessity, as Americans are living longer and face &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK588545/"&gt;greater challenges covering basic expenses in later life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it may be more important than ever to understand the pathways by which stress influences cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social isolation and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although everyone experiences some stress in daily life, some people experience stress that is more intense, persistent or prolonged. It is this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12020"&gt;relatively chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; that is most consistently linked with poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent review paper, our team summarized how chronic stress is a hidden but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322241303761"&gt;powerful factor underlying cognitive aging&lt;/a&gt;, or the speed at which your cognitive performance slows down with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to overstate the impact of stress on your cognitive health as you age. This is in part because your psychological, behavioral and biological responses to everyday stressful events &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.03.001"&gt;are closely intertwined&lt;/a&gt;, and each can amplify and interact with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, living alone can be stressful – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2019.02.007"&gt;particularly for older adults&lt;/a&gt; – and being isolated makes it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/adr-230011"&gt;more difficult to live a healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnac032"&gt;detect and get help for signs of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, stressful experiences – and your reactions to them – can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000704"&gt;make it harder to sleep well&lt;/a&gt; and to engage in other healthy behaviors, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-013-0090-5"&gt;like getting enough exercise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2021.1923406"&gt;maintaining a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, insufficient sleep and a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0000532"&gt;lack of physical activity&lt;/a&gt; can make it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0001033"&gt;harder to cope with stressful experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stress is often missing from dementia prevention efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robust body of research &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dementia-risk-factors-identified-in-global-report-are-all-preventable-addressing-them-could-reduce-dementia-rates-by-45-236290"&gt;highlights the importance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;at least 14 different factors&lt;/a&gt; that relate to your &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13809"&gt;risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, a common and devastating form of dementia and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of these factors may be outside of your control, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, many of these factors involve things that people do, such as physical activity, healthy eating and social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg" alt="People sitting at a table" class="size-full wp-image-145030" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Being isolated makes it more difficult to live a healthy lifestyle. (Peopleimages/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is less well-recognized is that chronic stress is intimately &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322241303761"&gt;interwoven with all of these factors&lt;/a&gt; that relate to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work and research by others that we reviewed in our recent paper demonstrate that chronic stress can affect brain function and physiology, influence mood and make it harder to maintain healthy habits. Yet, dementia prevention efforts rarely address stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding stressful events and difficult life circumstances is typically not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where and how you live and work plays a major role in how much stress you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, people with lower incomes, less education or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-neighborhoods-health-care-barriers-are-factors-for-heart-disease-risk-in-black-mothers-250591"&gt;those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; often face more frequent stress and have fewer forms of support – such as nearby clinics, access to healthy food, reliable transportation or safe places to exercise or socialize – to help them manage the challenges of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in recent work on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13670-023-00400-9"&gt;brain health in rural and underserved communities&lt;/a&gt;, these conditions can shape whether people have the chance to stay healthy as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the effects of stress tend to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fsci.2024.1389481"&gt;build up&lt;/a&gt;, wearing down the body's systems and shaping long-term emotional and social habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle changes to manage stress and lessen dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are multiple things that can be done to slow or prevent dementia, and our review suggests that these can be enhanced if the role of stress is better understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a young, midlife or an older adult, it is not too early or too late to address the implications of stress on brain health and aging. Here are a few ways you can take direct actions to help manage your level of stress:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow lifestyle behaviors that can &lt;a href="https://order.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/reducing-your-risk-dementia-tip-sheet.pdf"&gt;improve healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. These include: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2023.100257"&gt;following a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, engaging in &lt;a href="https://order.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/reducing-your-risk-dementia-tip-sheet.pdf"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and getting &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sleep/sleep-and-older-adults"&gt;enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Even small changes in these domains can make a big difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize your mental health and well-being to the extent you can. Things as simple as talking about your worries, asking for support from friends and family and going outside regularly can be immensely valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your doctor says that you or someone you care about should follow a new health care regimen, or suggests there are signs of cognitive impairment, ask them what support or advice they have for managing related stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you or a loved one feel socially isolated, consider how small shifts could make a difference. For instance, research suggests that adding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbae134"&gt;just one extra interaction a day&lt;/a&gt; – even if it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac083"&gt;a text message or a brief phone call&lt;/a&gt; – can be helpful, and that even interactions with people you don't know well, such as at a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; shop or doctor's office, can have meaningful benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGDypcvptX8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The same behaviors that keep your heart healthy are also beneficial for your brain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walkable neighborhoods, lifelong learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study identified stress as one of 17 overlapping factors that affect the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;odds of developing any brain disease&lt;/a&gt;, including stroke, late-life depression and dementia. This work suggests that addressing stress and overlapping issues such as loneliness may have additional health benefits as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all individuals or families are able to make big changes on their own. Research suggests that community-level and workplace interventions can reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140463" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642.jpg" alt="A person walking outdoors" class="size-full wp-image-140463" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140463" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Physical activity could help prevent dementia. (Alberto Menendez/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-023-01973-w"&gt;safe and walkable neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; and opportunities for social connection and lifelong learning – such as through community classes and events – have the potential to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2024.108254"&gt;reduce stress and promote brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, researchers have estimated that even a modest delay in disease onset of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; would save &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/fhep-2014-0013"&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars for every American&lt;/a&gt; affected. Thus, providing incentives to companies who offer stress management resources could ultimately save money as well as help people age more healthfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, stress related to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200932"&gt;stigma around mental health and aging&lt;/a&gt; can discourage people from seeking support that would benefit them. Even just thinking about your risk of dementia can be stressful in itself. Things can be done about this, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01406-X"&gt;normalizing the use of hearing aids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-023-04053-3"&gt;integrating reports of perceived memory and mental health issues&lt;/a&gt; into routine primary care and workplace wellness programs could encourage people to engage with preventive services earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although research on potential biomedical treatments is ongoing and important, there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, if interventions aimed at reducing stress were prioritized in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-022-01385-1"&gt;guidelines for dementia prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits could be far-reaching, resulting in both delayed disease onset and improved quality of life for millions of people.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250583/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Brigham Young University researchers call sugar in beverages a “major culprit” in the growth of type 2 diabetes cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Not all sugars are equally risky, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; they conducted that was just published in the journal Advances in Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;BYU researchers including a pair of students teamed up with researchers at two Germany-based institutions for what’s being called the “largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis of its kind.” Their key finding is that the kind of sugar one consumes and its source are more important than previously thought and not all sugars carry the same degree of risk for diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sugar in drinks — think sodas and fruit juice — are “consistently linked” to greater risk of type 2 diabetes, the study found. Other sugar sources showed no such link and, in some cases, might even be associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sugar itself is not inherently harmful, said lead author and nutritional sciences professor Karen Della Corte. The form and amount consumed make the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study-design" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The research included analysis of more than 20 cohort studies from different regions of the world, including Europe, the United States, Asia, Australia and Latin America. They involved a half-million people. The researchers adjusted for body mass index, excess energy intake and several lifestyle factors, according to a BYU news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The new study found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each additional 12-ounce serving of sugar-sweetened beverages raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 25%. The risk, per the researchers, began with the first daily serving. They found no minimum threshold below which drinking a sugar-sweetened beverage was safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With each added 8-ounce serving of fruit juice each day, risk of developing type 2 diabetes was smaller, but still increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The risks are relative, according to the BYU research team. In the example of someone with a baseline 10% risk of developing type 2 diabetes, for instance, “four sodas a day could raise that to roughly 20%, not 100%.” And individuals have their own baseline risks, depending on personal factors like genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study found the surprising indication that 20g/day of table sugar and total sugar — which is the sum of all naturally occurring and added sugars in the diet — hinted at a protective relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;How could that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers suggest that eating sugar and drinking it have different metabolic effects that may account for the difference in risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Sugar-sweetened drinks provide isolated sugars that kick off greater glycemic impact. That can overwhelm the liver’s metabolic process and cause fatty liver and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dietary sugars, though, when consumed in or added to nutrient-dense foods like fruit, dairy products and whole grains, don’t overwhelm the liver. “These embedded sugars elicit slower blood glucose responses due to accompanying fiber, fats, proteins and other beneficial nutrients,” per the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So sugars eaten with whole foods are much less harmful than those consumed in liquid form, Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She noted that the human body is not accustomed to processing and metabolizing the very high amounts of sugars found in sugar-sweetened beverages. “Sugar has always been a part of the human diet. But in the modern age we’re consuming it differently; we’re consuming it in isolated amounts and not in the context of whole foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Della Corte said sugar is not a “nutritional villain” on its own. What matters is how much you consume and in what form, as well as whether you’re consuming it alongside macronutrients that can slow down its digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The body can metabolize small amounts of fructose without harm, but when consumed in excess — especially from sugar-sweetened beverages — the liver becomes overwhelmed. Unlike glucose, fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it can be converted into fat through a process called de novo lipogenesis. This buildup of liver fat contributes to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is associated with insulin resistance. Over time, this can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,” Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s an unhealthy cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Della Corte said the study was unique in what it examined. Many other studies have looked at the impact of sugary sodas and other beverages, but not whether different types of sugar have different effects. It also examined the impact of sugar on different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Fruit-juice-not-ideal-either" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Fruit juice not ideal either&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Fruit juice is not as good for you as whole fruits. Whole fruits provide fiber, which benefits blood glucose regulation. Fruit juices have too much sugar without the nutritional benefits like fiber that can reduce the risk, Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said juices have nearly the same level of sugar as sodas have. It’s somewhat less harmful because of the phytonutrients, but not enough to overcome all the potential harms. “It’s a poor substitute for whole fruits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She added that high glycemic index foods directly raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, while dietary sugar does not except in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health,” said Della Corte. “Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Type 2 diabetes was the sole health indicator used in the study. And the study didn’t look at the impact of artificial sweeteners, such as those found in diet sodas. Della Corte did note that the people who consume artificial sweeteners often do so because they already have a higher risk of health issues like type 2 diabetes, which could further complicate interpreting a study of the impact of artificial sweeteners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;BYU professors James LeCheminant and Dennis Della Corte, as well as students Tyler Bosler and Cole McClure were also co-authors on the study, along with German researchers Anette E.

			&lt;p&gt;In the first years of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Americans &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/01/science/covid-deaths-united-states.html"&gt;were dying&lt;/a&gt; at much higher rates than other wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis now estimates that in 2020 and 2021, more than two million Americans went &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad173"&gt;'missing'&lt;/a&gt; from the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people who would still be alive if the US had the same death rate as other high-income nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, not all of these 'excess' deaths are due to COVID-19, but a significant portion are tied to the timing of the global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine the lives saved, the grief and trauma averted, if the US simply performed at the average of our peers," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and epidemiologist Jacob Bor from Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162659" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-642x866.png" alt="US Excess Deaths" class="wp-image-162659 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-642x866.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-308x415.png 308w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-768x1036.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1138x1536.png 1138w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-600x810.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162659" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;US excess deaths compared to other wealthy nations. (Bor et al., &lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis is a broad, sweeping take on a big and complicated issue, but it supports previous &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-023-09762-6"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have also found Americans suffer poor survival outcomes compared to residents in other wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study compares more than 107 million deaths of any cause in the US between 1980 and 2023 to death rates in 21 other wealthy nations. The selected countries each had a 2021 GDP exceeding US $24,000 per capita, and had data available in the Human Mortality Database spanning the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over those 43 years, the US experienced 14.7 million excess deaths relative to its peers, with a significant uptick starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before the COVID-19 pandemic began, however, data suggest health outcomes in the US were gradually slipping compared to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of a novel  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 only widened that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bor and colleagues calculated that in 2019, there was a total of 631,247 missing Americans. In 2020 and 2021, that number shot up to over a million per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2022, excess deaths had slipped back to 820,396, before dropping further to 705,331 in 2023. But that is still significantly higher than in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US experienced the same expected death rates as other nations, the authors of the study think nearly a quarter of all deaths could have been avoided in 2023, many among younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One out of every two US deaths under 65 years is likely avoidable," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our failure to address this is a national scandal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These excess deaths are not simply due to the consequences of the coronavirus, although the pandemic certainly exacerbated the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sociologist Elizabeth Wrigley-Field from the University of Minnesota &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the increase in deaths from 2019 to 2023 is also "driven by long-running crises in drug overdose, gun violence, car collisions, and preventable cardiometabolic deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162663" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-642x444.png" alt="COVID Mortality Uptick" class="size-medium wp-image-162663" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-642x444.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-600x415.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-768x531.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1.png 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162663" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Excess deaths in the US before and after the start of the pandemic. (Bor et al., &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834281"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-023-09762-6"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2023, researchers used global data to show that the US experiences excess mortality in every single age group compared to its wealthy peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US could achieve the lower mortality rates of Japan, for example, the 2023 study suggested more than 880,000 deaths could be prevented. That's comparable to eliminating all deaths from heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; unintentional injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other countries show that investing in universal healthcare, strong safety nets, and evidence-based public health policies leads to longer, healthier lives," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; senior author Andrew Stokes, demographer and sociologist at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These deaths reflect not individual choices, but policy neglect and deep-rooted social and health system failures. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed structural weaknesses – including gaps in healthcare access and social supports – that have continued to fuel premature deaths even after the acute phase of the pandemic ended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research letter was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1118"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He had seen it advertised for improving liver health on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a week later, Grafton noticed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14571833/toxic-liver-disease-face-skin-rosacea-signs.html"&gt;his urine had turned dark&lt;/a&gt;, he felt nauseous, lost his appetite and was constantly itchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing his deteriorating health was tied to the supplements, he stopped consuming them and went to the hospital out of fear that he was suffering from liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing revealed he had a drug-induced liver injury, or DILI, which caused damage to his liver due because of his excessive turmeric consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DILI is often caused by any kind of medication or supplement that claims to promote muscle growth or reduce stress. These types of supplements often contain similar ingredients that can harm the liver when consumed in excess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert Grafton, 54, a New Jersey father-of-five is warning people of taking 'herbal' supplements after he was left fighting for his life due to a rare liver injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/supplements-drug-induced-liver-damage-toxic-hepatitis-what-know-rcna208390"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'My liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin (a yellowish pigment produced after red blood cell breakdown) was really high - all the signs of liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is responsible for numerous bodily functions, including filtering blood, processing nutrients and detoxifying the body of harmful substances, such as alcohol and drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also responsible for providing support to the immune system, clotting blood and producing bile, a fluid that helps digest fats and absorb nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes an excessive consumption of ultra-concentrated supplements, whether they are of natural ingredients or those chemically made, can cause an injury if the liver isn't able to effectively filter them out of the body, causing them to build up in toxic amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a hepatologist who treated Grafton told NBC: 'I think people assume these things are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The Number one reason we see people taking these are for good health or to supplement their health and so I don't think that they realize that there is a real risk here.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that even though Grafton had stopped taking supplements after noticing he was sick, a turmeric overload had already occurred in his body and caused an injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton was taking turmeric pills that contained 2,250 milligrams of curcumin, a substance that comes from the root of the turmeric plant and black pepper extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet brought at common convenience stores contains 500mgs of the spice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim a daily consumption of less than 2,000mgs of turmeric through supplements is considered safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a Jefferson Health hepatologist who treated Grafton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet contains 500 milligrams of the spice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Halegoua-De Marzio said: 'When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000mgs plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coupled with black pepper, the liver now has to break down that supplement and it can't. It could make it really sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown turmeric can improve liver health by decreasing inflammation, reducing the accumulation of fat and detoxifying the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other studies suggest natural supplements made with turmeric can also cause serious liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2010 peer-reviewed study showed over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually - out of which over 2,000 end up dying because of the severity of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite scientific evidence, herbal supplements continue to become more popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 JAMA Network study found that turmeric is the most commonly consumed supplement in the US, followed by green tea extract, ashwagandha, Garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice and black cohosh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 15.6million Americans take supplements containing at least one of these six botanicals - mostly without a doctor's advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration considers herbal supplements as dietary supplements and does not regulate, oversee or approve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it is impossible for consumers to know whether they re actually consuming what is advertised or if it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure that she linked to methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), an ingredient in a common over-the-counter vitamin that claims to improve hair, skin and nail health &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton is not the only person to suffer from DILI or serious liver damage due to a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure due to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is in common over-the-counter vitamins that claim to improve hair, skin and nail health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protective against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, though research and data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ramirez became jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She also had to undergo surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, blocking the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a 45-year-old woman was found to be suffering from herbal supplement-induced liver injury after she complained of gastric pain and nausea from consuming an herbal tea for three days to improve immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding doctors noted she showed no signs of jaundice, had a non-tender abdomen and showed signs of liver infection such as Hepatitis A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after a series of tests and exams, they found that the presence of reishi mushroom, aloe vera and Siberian ginseng - all natural herbs - had caused her pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for Grafton, after finding out he had a liver injury, Grafton said his blood work had returned to normal within weeks of ceasing the supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional testing revealed no permanent damage to his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The whole push with that is that you're getting a super-high, concentrated dose of turmeric and dandelion root and milk thistle, which I have always known from my medical past is good for liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It all sounded good, I thought I did enough digging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because on his experience, he added: 'I don’t take any supplements whatsoever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 01:58:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>血脑屏障“守护者”显示出对抗阿尔茨海默氏症的承诺- ScienceAlert | Blood-Brain Barrier 'Guardian' Shows Promise Against Alzheimer's - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNFM0MnoyMDBoWnZMMGZ2V0hBX1JIMk1IM0N0THRrazlHd3FmNlVhZVcxMDVaelJ4dXZnRDRkSUZybUdfaFVpRXFaRXhYaEdHN3V2djl2ZGNZMXJuX1pYYktYMU13X0xLUVNLZDFzUE0zUFBBNnV5RXM5d29lT0FDcDJrNkxNZExPN2x0R25pOWphdlEz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new drug targeting inflammation in the brain has been shown to bolster the blood-brain barrier in mice, pioneering a potential shift in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="162692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Finding [the drug] blocks brain inflammation and protects the blood-brain barrier was an exciting new discovery," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pathologist Sanford Markowitz from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers note that amyloid levels – the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;abnormally clumping proteins&lt;/a&gt; traditionally thought to play a role in the progress of Alzheimer's – remained the same. This suggests the new treatment, focusing on an immune protein called 15-PGDH, targets a completely different physiological pathway than many existing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162699" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons.jpg" alt="3D illustration of yellow clumps amongst blue and purple cells and molecules" class="wp-image-162699 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162699" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of the amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is important because the most recently approved Alzheimer's drugs focus only on removing amyloid and, unfortunately, don't work very well and have risky side effects," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Markowitz. "Inhibiting 15-PGDH thus offers a completely new approach for Alzheimer's disease treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is a layer of tissue that any substance entering the brain via the blood must pass through. When intact, the barrier filters out potential dangers such as toxins, bacteria, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326726/"&gt;can damage&lt;/a&gt; this barrier, increasing risks to brain cells. Such blood-brain barrier deterioration has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-link-points-to-immune-attack-and-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;also been identified&lt;/a&gt; as a possible early indicator of dementias like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By investigating the molecules active within the blood-brain barrier cells, CWRU physiologist Yeojung Koh and colleagues were able to identify that the immune enzyme 15-PGDH was elevated in both mice and humans with neurodegeneration arising from age, injury, or disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the researchers developed SW033291; a compound that can block the enzyme's activity. The medication was found to successfully protect the blood-brain barrier in mice and prevent cognitive impairment even after traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these mouse models treated with the drug, the blood-brain barrier remained completely undamaged," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Andrew Pieper, also from CWRU. "The brains didn't undergo neurodegeneration and, most importantly, cognition and memory capacity were completely preserved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162697" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels.jpg" alt="Diagram of the blood brain barrier anatomy" class="wp-image-162697 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162697" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Anatomy of blood vessels within the brain with the extra layers of protection formed in part by astrocytes known as the blood-brain barrier. (Olha Pohrebniak/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With almost &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;10 million new global cases of dementia yearly&lt;/a&gt;, an increasing number of people face cognitive decline, either personally or in loved ones. And despite decades of research, treatment outcomes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-could-explain-why-weve-been-misled-over-the-cause-of-alzheimers"&gt;remain unclear&lt;/a&gt;. Exploring new tactics like this is essential to improving lives, but there's still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings establish 15-PGDH as a guardian of blood-brain barrier integrity… and a compelling target for protection from neurodegenerative disease," Koh and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2417224122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2417224122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study from scientists in China is shifting how we think about aging. The long-held belief that aging is a one-way path may no longer hold. This fresh take comes from a team at the &lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)&lt;/a&gt;, offering new insight into how aging might not be as fixed as once thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work centers on metformin, a widely used drug for type 2 diabetes. Though common, this medication may hold uncommon promise: the ability to slow the aging process itself. Researchers believe this could eventually lead to treatments that help people live healthier, longer lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together leading experts in the field. Liu Guanghui and Qu Jing, both from the Institute of Zoology, teamed up with Zhang Weiqi from the &lt;a href="http://english.big.cas.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beijing Institute of Genomics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Beijing Institute of Genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;00914-0), a top-tier scientific journal. The work reflects a growing wave of curiosity about extending not just lifespan, but also healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin treatment changed microglia from a proinflammatory phenotype (left) into a noninflammatory phenotype (right) in the aged hippocampus. (CREDIT: Aging Cell)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fda-approved-ed-drug-can-significantly-reduce-blood-sugar-levels-in-type-2-diabetics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metformin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;’s effect on aging, the team studied Cynomolgus monkeys—animals with biology much like ours. Their close genetic and physiological ties to humans make them ideal for exploring how anti-aging treatments might work. This choice gave the study real weight in the context of human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a 40-month period, the scientists tracked the monkeys’ health using a battery of advanced tools. These included medical imaging, blood tests, physiological checks, and deep tissue analysis across multiple organs. Male monkeys received metformin regularly, allowing researchers to observe any long-term changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Metformin provided clear protective effects across several vital organs. The liver, heart, lungs, and muscles all showed &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/omega-3-vitamin-d-and-exercise-proven-to-slow-down-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slower signs of aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slower signs of aging&lt;/a&gt;. These findings suggest that this familiar diabetes drug may do far more than control blood sugar—it might help protect the body from age itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, it mitigated the atrophy of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-how-your-brain-converts-sounds-into-actions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cerebral cortex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;, enhanced cognitive function, and slowed periodontal bone loss. This suggests that metformin may be acting directly on neurons and other cells, independent of its usual function in blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified that metformin activates the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant gene expression network in the brain, delaying the effects of cellular aging. This mechanism provides a strong scientific basis for metformin’s geroprotective properties and could pave the way for future therapeutic advancements aimed at slowing down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its direct impact on neurons, the researchers employed machine learning models to evaluate the overall systemic effects of metformin on aging. These models helped them build a comprehensive assessment of tissue and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-enzyme-that-reverses-muscle-loss-due-to-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:organ aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;organ aging&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for precise evaluations of the drug’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;High-precision aging clocks at the single-cell level demonstrated that the biological age of neural cells in the brain and hepatocytes in the liver was reduced by approximately five to six years. (CREDIT: Cell)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated a significant reduction in biological age markers in primates treated with metformin. DNA methylation age, transcriptome age, and plasma protein and metabolite age were all reduced. The most substantial reduction observed was equivalent to 18 human years, a striking finding that highlights metformin’s potential in delaying biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of metformin were most pronounced in the frontal lobe of the brain and the liver, two areas particularly vulnerable to aging. High-precision aging clocks at the single-cell level demonstrated that the biological age of neural &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-unlock-the-secret-to-a-longer-life-through-brain-cells/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cells in the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cells in the brain&lt;/a&gt; and hepatocytes in the liver was reduced by approximately five to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When translated to humans, this is equivalent to about 15 to 18 years. The study’s thorough and methodical approach offers new paradigms and standards for evaluating human aging interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin slows brain aging in primates. (CREDIT: LIU Guanghui's lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers emphasized, the study’s implications are far-reaching. "This is a significant step forward in understanding the biology of aging," said one of the lead scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also highlights the shift in geriatric medicine from treating individual &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-find-surprising-link-between-dishwashers-and-chronic-illnesses/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; to addressing the aging process as a whole. This transition represents a new frontier in healthcare, one that targets the root causes of aging to improve overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As human life expectancy continues to rise, the focus on aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular conditions, has grown. However, this study demonstrates the possibility of targeting the aging process itself, rather than merely treating its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With metformin showing such potential, future research could lead to broader applications for humans, possibly helping to reduce age-related decline and enhance the quality of life in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin slows brain aging in primates. (CREDIT: LIU Guanghui's lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens new doors to understanding and potentially reversing aspects of aging. By using metformin, scientists have not only expanded knowledge about cellular aging but also laid the groundwork for future therapies aimed at delaying the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/harvard-researchers-create-new-pill-that-can-reverse-the-aging-process/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging process;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a major leap forward in the field of geriatric medicine, signaling a future where aging may not be an inevitable decline, but a process that can be managed and perhaps even reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Materials provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government announced Wednesday that it is cancelling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296672/cdc-bird-flu-study-mmwr-veterinarians" target="_blank"&gt;spreading among dairy cows &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., citing concerns about the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;safety of the mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; being used.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/1263339284/bird-flu-update-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable," HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public," Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that "the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable." The official did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was "disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply," Nuzzo added in an email. "What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced "positive interim" results and the company "had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program," Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said &lt;a href="https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/healthcare-and-pharmaceutical/moderna-announces-update-on-investigational-pandemic-influenza-progra-1033069" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" target="_blank"&gt;Ashish Jha&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection," Jha said. "The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic," he said in an email. "This is a dangerous course to follow."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 41 dairy herds, and 24 poultry farms and culling operations, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The source of the condition, it appears, was a since-discontinued hormone treatment she received decades earlier that unknowingly introduced a rogue protein into her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make no apologies for being alarmist: &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/prions" target="_blank"&gt;prions&lt;/a&gt; are pretty terrifying. They are misfolded proteins that can trigger a domino effect by causing normal, neighboring proteins in the brain to misfold and become corrupted themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike bacteria, viruses, or other infectious agents, prions contain no genetic material, yet they are nearly impossible to destroy and can lie dormant for decades before unleashing devastating effects. Once active, they carve out holes in the brain tissue, causing it to take on a sponge-like appearance. The result is rapid cognitive decline, behavioral changes, movement disorders, and ultimately death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no known cure or any treatment that can halt their progression. Fortunately, cases are relatively rare: around 300 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prion-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most infamous causes of prion diseases in humans is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-is-what-eating-people-does-to-the-human-body-46459" target="_blank"&gt;eating brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; of an animal that has itself been infected with prions, although there are &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tainted-mouse-brains-and-a-minor-lab-accident-led-to-a-womans-death-56674" target="_blank"&gt;several other unusual ways&lt;/a&gt; in which these abnormal proteins can enter the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new medical case study, doctors in the US report the case of a 58-year-old woman who had the misfortune of falling sick with a human prion disease known as iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="84109" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;This photomicrograph shows fluorescently labeled prions (red) that have been taken up and distributed in rodent brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: NIAID (Public DOmain)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She first went to the doctor with tremors and difficulty walking, but things quickly took a sharp turn. Within weeks, she lost control of her bladder, her speech became slurred, and her movement issues worsened. As her condition spiraled, she developed rapid breathing, extreme startle reflexes, and rigid limbs. Soon after, she slipped into unconsciousness, required a ventilator to breathe, and began experiencing violent, uncontrollable muscle jerks – never regaining consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with her previously stated wishes, life support was gently withdrawn and she passed away peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After researching the case, the team concluded that the prion disease was linked to a hormone treatment she received as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1971, when she was 7 years old, the patient had received over nine years of &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/national-prion-clinic/cadaveric-human-growth-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;cadaveric human growth hormone&lt;/a&gt; treatment. This treatment was designed to address growth hormone deficiency in children by regularly injecting them with human growth hormone that was extracted from the pituitary glands of people who had died. It was &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/alzheimers-disease-likely-transmitted-to-5-patients-via-banned-medical-procedure-72668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; in 1985 after it was linked to cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explain that her case is just one in a wider outbreak of iCJD resulting from cadaveric human growth hormone. They noted that the number of cases has “slowed substantially” in recent years because the treatment was 40 years ago, halting further exposure. Most people who were at risk have either already died from the disease or are beyond the typical incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they warn that doctors should remain vigilant as cases may still be out there, as this tragic case shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is published in the CDC’s journal &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article#suggestedcitation" target="_blank"&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:12:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZGVvWDFpRkdtbG9vVDZOVl80bGNKb1FhdjVOTm51SGFLYVRWeGtqZzFWSHVlNllVd2twMmVrM1RSZ2k0dEVRX2NibU9qejRCU0FOLWd1Rmt2LW5hR1NnZEt4NHgyNHFpUWlDalpCRS1GMldXeFdobVl5Q244UlJVU29LRjlmX0diQ1hmTVc3NWhCMlJwdUd3bUozY2dWSnc</guid></item><item><title>美国疾病控制与预防中心（ CDC ）在RFK Jr.更改疫苗建议时失明-《华盛顿邮报》 | CDC blindsided as RFK Jr. changes vaccine recommendations - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQWVJibE1kNjZ4MU9oVTZhbzVlWVNKNzYtdjQ2VVF1elJmLW9HVmtNeE1YRXFJLWMwbzhtZmF2XzFSWmpwcFhHeUQzSFNUSERvSDFEdmxYOENHWkx5MG12NS1teE9IUDZCZjBRbE8xek5CVWVrVmdnd1NWenZyZUF6Xw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EGPOSQXM3VDNTL5UCXOFHE2AIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The website for pregnant women continued to recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/pregnant-or-breastfeeding.html" target="_blank"&gt;an updated shot&lt;/a&gt; for those who are pregnant, breastfeeding an infant, trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RCOIQRIAHRBKLMCQE2WRQQB76A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The bottom line, according to public health experts and agency officials, appears to be an effort by Kennedy and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Trump administration to further erode public trust in the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KMOEZ7GEGFDVBKEKFCPVGH6JIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a longtime pediatric infectious-diseases physician, said bypassing the CDC makes it more difficult for people to access the coronavirus vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;People should look for symptoms of measles if they visited any of the following locations during the exposure windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children’s Hospital Colorado emergency department: 6 to 10 p.m. May 22; 1:10 to 7:15 a.m. Monday; or 9:25 p.m. Monday to 4:15 a.m. Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walgreens, 18461 E. Hampden Ave.: 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. Friday; 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. Sunday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sam’s Club, 880 S. Abilene St.: noon to 3:30 p.m. Sunday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Grocers, 3440 S. Tower Road: 6 to 8:10 p.m. Sunday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who visited those locations during the time when the virus lingered in the air should watch for symptoms until June 17, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. A rash generally starts on the face about four days after the infected person becomes contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vSMIrQzs8A"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/25/measles-outbreak-cases-colorado-texas-vaccine/"&gt;Parts of Colorado face measles risk as high as West Texas due to low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who develops symptoms after visiting an exposure location should call their health care provider before coming in, so they can take precautions to avoid spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing illness. Unvaccinated people who receive the shot up to 72 hours after exposure may be able to prevent measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Adams and Arapahoe counties are offering special clinics for exposed people on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1401 W. 122nd Ave. #200, Westminster, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altura Plaza, 15400 E. 14th Place, Aurora, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child, who is under 5 and wasn't vaccinated, is hospitalized at Children's and receiving care. The hospital has taken precautions to avoid exposing any other patients, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child lives in Arapahoe County and recently traveled with family to "multiple international locations with increased measles cases," according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department didn't release any more information about the child's condition. Most children who have measles recover without complications, but some develop dehydration, pneumonia or inflammation in the brain. Estimates put the death rate somewhere between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;one and three out of every 1,000 people infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 94% of Colorado school children are up-to-date on their measles shots, but &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/25/measles-outbreak-cases-colorado-texas-vaccine/"&gt;parts of the state have much lower rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has confirmed six measles cases this year, the most since at least 1996. Others infected include an &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;adult in Pueblo County&lt;/a&gt;; a Denver baby and &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;an unidentified person&lt;/a&gt; who lives in the same household; a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/colorado-measles-denver-lakewood-exposure/"&gt;Denver adult&lt;/a&gt;; and an &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;adult in Archuleta County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the possibility of the cancellation had been anticipated — the new leadership at HHS told the company in February that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/"&gt;it was reviewing the contract&lt;/a&gt;, signed with the Biden administration — the move is being seen as a significant blow to the country’s capacity to respond to pandemic influenza.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No other flu vaccine production approach can produce doses with the speed of the messenger RNA platform used by Moderna and other companies that work with mRNA. But the vaccine platform is viewed with deep suspicion by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his political base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a diagnostic challenge, and doctors began reviewing the list of possibilities that could match his condition. The first guess of pneumonia could explain some of his respiratory findings, but he didn't have a cough, had tested negative for common respiratory pathogens, and the lung imaging didn't quite fit, making it seem unlikely. Blood cancers, such as polycythemia vera, might be able to explain the high concentrations of blood cells. And it might also make him more vulnerable to opportunistic lung infections, like a fungal infection that could explain the halo sign. But blood cancers were also deemed unlikely given that he didn't have enlarged organs, which is often seen with such conditions. Another possibility of pulmonary–renal syndrome, but that also didn't line up with the man's case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other possibility that seemed to tick all the boxes: fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, low oxygen saturation, pulmonary edema, and shock—a hantavirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are RNA viruses that infect rodents worldwide. They typically cause asymptomatic, chronic infections in the animals, which spread the virus widely into their environments through their urine, feces, and saliva. Humans get infected when virus particles from rodent-contaminated areas are stirred up into the air and inhaled, or through direct contact with the virus via the eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, the viral infection is anything but asymptomatic. While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906001882?via%3Dihub"&gt;the disease mechanism&lt;/a&gt; isn't entirely understood, the virus appears to be able to modulate immune responses in humans, causing blood vessels and capillaries in various places in the body to start leaking plasma. This leads to fluid building up in the lungs (the pulmonary edema) and systemic circulatory collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cardiopulmonary hantavirus infection typically has four stages: the incubation period, which can last up to 45 days after virus exposure; a prodromal phase up to 12 days that are marked by fever, fatigue, and pains; the cardiopulmonary phase, where breathing trouble, low oxygen saturation, and shock can develop; then, if you make it, the fourth stage, in which respiratory symptoms improve, but there's lingering fatigue and the kidneys make abnormally large amounts of urine.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists studying mice found that individual neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr) switch dynamically between activation and inhibition based on the phase of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These SNr signals work like traffic lights, allowing complex behaviors to emerge from precisely timed combinations of “go” and “stop” instructions. The findings could reshape treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, where this balance of movement control breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; SNr neurons dynamically increase or decrease activity depending on specific movement phases like reach, grasp, or retract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic Light Model:&lt;/strong&gt; The basal ganglia output works like a fine-tuned traffic control system, licensing or blocking individual movements in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to better treatments for movement disorders like Parkinson’s by targeting precise timing mechanisms in motor control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Basel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurons deep in the brain not only help to initiate movement—they also actively suppress it, and with astonishing precision. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study by researchers at the University of Basel and the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI), published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially relevant for better understanding neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110420"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching for an apple or bringing a spoon to the mouth—these seemingly simple actions rely on highly complex processes in the brain. A key player in this orchestration is a deep-seated brain region known as the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the output signal of the basal ganglia was thought to function mainly as a brake, suppressing unwanted behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Professor Silvia Arber have now shown in mice that specific neurons in the basal ganglia make highly precise decisions about when to allow and when to actively stop a specific movement. Together, these dynamic signals license the timing of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basal ganglia: A central switchboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights challenge the long-standing model of how the basal ganglia work. According to the traditional view, the basal ganglia control movement by continuously inhibiting motor centers in the brain, only briefly “releasing the brake” when a movement is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this model falls far short in terms of complex movements, such as those involved in coordinated actions of the arms and hands,” explains Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers made a surprising discovery: the neurons in this region don’t merely fire to inhibit movement. Instead, they display highly dynamic activity patterns —precisely timed to the movements being executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During complex behaviors, SNr neurons switch multiple times between increased and decreased activity, each neuron with its specific dynamic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the output of the basal ganglia functions like a finely tuned system of traffic lights at a busy intersection: each light turns green or red for specific movements, depending on the action that is planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, complex behaviors can be built from individual movements, governed by the timing of these “go” and “stop” signals provided by SNr neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-grained movement control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these processes, two of Arber’s doctoral students recorded brain activity in mice as these used their hands to reach for food pellets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that individual SNr neurons responded very differently depending on the movement phase: when the arm reached, the hand grasped, or was retracted, specific neurons increased their activity while others paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing how finely tuned these signals are,” Antonio Falasconi and Harsh Kanodia, the study’s lead authors, agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SNr neurons only pause their activity during very specific movements and increase it during select others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optogenetic techniques, the researchers then manipulated SNr neurons. They were able to show that activating these neurons blocked the behavior—a clear demonstration of their controlling role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, even the slightest changes in movement were accompanied by precise adjustments in SNr signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream motor centers in the brainstem responded by sending signals back to the SNr. So when the SNr “traffic light” turned green, the downstream neuron essentially presses the gas pedal, allowing the execution of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a highly specific, movement-based coding system—far more granular than just a general “go” or “stop” mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New avenues for treating movement disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers a vivid picture of how the brain controls even the subtlest movements through a fine-tuned interplay of activation and inhibition—reshaping our understanding of motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important medical implications: in disorders like Parkinson’s or chorea, this delicate balance is disrupted, leading to hallmark symptoms such as difficulty initiating movement in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we understand how the basal ganglia coordinate normal movement, we can develop more targeted treatments when this system goes out of balance,” explains lead researcher Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1b0bfb6b4bdb8bab0ffbbb0b2beb3a291a4bfb8b3b0a2ffb2b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angelika Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unibas.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Basel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angelika Jacobs – University of Basel&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09066-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Arber et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:50:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VQlRwV1VIVkwtc3U0bTNGQ05RZ0pJbkdhVHBUWU5JX3NrQlZjQlYza1ZYT2NraFJPc2p2MklneVBfdWRjcDllYmw1QWVtb2dqMWtrNmxtbWlpNWFaX0hIM0FpY0xEOFdhbF9PT0N3WENHeHM</guid></item><item><title>PCOS影响全球八分之一的女性，但它经常被误解。更名可能会有所帮助- The Conversation | PCOS affects 1 in 8 women worldwide, yet it’s often misunderstood.

    &lt;p&gt;Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;one in eight women globally&lt;/a&gt;. However, this complex hormonal condition is under-researched and often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is partly due to its name, which overemphasises “cysts” and the ovaries. In fact, you can have &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;PCOS&lt;/a&gt; without cysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can affect many parts of the body, not just the ovaries, leading to acne, excess body hair, changes in metabolism and even mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new research, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00219-6/fulltext"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;, shows that changing the name would help better reflect the complexity of PCOS and improve awareness about this condition. We surveyed 7,700 health professionals and people with PCOS and found the majority supported a name change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is PCOS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCOS is a chronic condition caused by an imbalance of multiple hormones – the body’s chemical messengers – that circulate through the body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes and environment play a role. &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as diet (especially ultraprocessed foods) and activity, can also lead to weight gain and worsen its severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In PCOS, the “cysts” are actually partially developed eggs that, due to underlying hormonal imbalance, remain dormant. This means they are less likely to be released (ovulation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional ovarian cysts, these dormant eggs will generally not grow larger, cause pain, require surgery or burst. Instead, they are slowly reabsorbed over time back into the ovary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having dormant eggs in your ovaries is not, by itself, enough to &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;be diagnosed with PCOS&lt;/a&gt; – and you can have PCOS without any dormant eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So, what’s needed to diagnose PCOS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For adults, a &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;diagnosis requires&lt;/a&gt; two of three features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  irregular periods (due to limited ovulation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  high levels of certain hormones (&lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;androgens&lt;/a&gt;), such as testosterone, which is evident either in blood tests or symptoms (excess facial and body hair, acne, and thinning/balding scalp)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  excess dormant eggs detected either on an ultrasound or ovarian hormone blood test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In adolescents, only &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;the first two criteria&lt;/a&gt; are needed for a diagnosis. Ovary tests (ultrasound or blood tests) are not recommended until after age 20, as changes in the ovaries are common during normal adolescent development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these criteria focus heavily on the ovaries and menstrual cycles, neglecting the condition’s broader impacts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Widespread health effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, hormonal imbalances in PCOS affect multiple systems in the body. This &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;can include&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; – higher blood pressure and cholesterol, and greater risk of heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reproductive system&lt;/strong&gt; – irregular menstrual cycles, reduced fertility and pregnancy complications and increased endometrial cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skin&lt;/strong&gt; – excess facial/body hair, acne, scalp hair thinning and dark skin patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mental health&lt;/strong&gt; – anxiety, depression, disordered eating and body image concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCOS has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8718-sleep-apnea"&gt;sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt; (a sleep disorder involving irregular breathing, snoring and fatigue) and inflammatory conditions such as asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;PCOS affects one in eight women globally.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/three-women-wearing-sportswear-smiling-and-talking-royalty-free-image/2207701117?phrase=group%20of%20women%20different%20ages&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Brothers91/Getty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Widespread confusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for women with PCOS to see two or three doctors and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/2/604/2972079"&gt;wait years&lt;/a&gt; for a diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;Many types of doctors&lt;/a&gt;, including GPs and hormone, skin and fertility specialists, may be involved in care.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, health-care providers focus on reproductive concerns, &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;overlooking other health impacts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common but problematic approaches include not informing women of the diagnosis, telling them not to “worry” about their PCOS until they wish to conceive, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/2/604/2972079"&gt;providing inadequate information&lt;/a&gt; or only addressing the problem in their speciality area, such as infertility.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fragmentation creates a troubling paradox. &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;Some are told&lt;/a&gt; they’ll face infertility. Yet without proper education they may be unaware they can still occasionally ovulate and may experience unexpected pregnancies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, others planning for families &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39547344/"&gt;often face&lt;/a&gt; unforeseen fertility difficulties that early comprehensive care – such as reproductive life planning, healthy lifestyle and early treatment – could have addressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The case to change the name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00219-6/fulltext"&gt;our new study&lt;/a&gt;, we surveyed 3,462 health professionals and 4,246 people with PCOS across six continents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to find out what health-care professionals, doctors and those affected by the condition understood about PCOS, and whether understanding has improved over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to understand whether changing the name – for example, to include “endocrine” or “metabolic” – could have a positive impact, given frequent confusion and misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for a name change was widespread: 86% of women with PCOS and 76% of health professionals said renaming PCOS would better reflect the condition, reduce confusion and likely lead to better outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now leading an international process to find a consensus on a new name and formally change it in the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases"&gt;International Classification of Diseases&lt;/a&gt;. This involves engaging widely with health professionals and people with PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reframing PCOS beyond a purely reproductive disorder, a name change can support
broader research funding, education and advocacy. It may lead to better recognition and improved diagnosis, care and outcomes for people with PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Combating misinformation with evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate information is critical for proper PCOS management. Yet misinformation about the condition – for example, that PCOS can be cured through diet or exacerbated by the oral contraceptive pill – is &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz2p0999yo"&gt;rife on social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also co-designed and developed &lt;a href="https://www.mchri.org.au/guidelines-resources/community/pcos-resources/"&gt;evidence-based guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and free resources for people with PCOS to find out more about the condition, including the free “&lt;a href="http://www.askpcos.org"&gt;Ask PCOS&lt;/a&gt;” app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renaming PCOS is another key step in improving knowledge about this understudied condition – and care for &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos/guideline"&gt;the 170 million women&lt;/a&gt; affected worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain's recovery—both physical and cognitive—overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM's Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab's director, Karim Jerbi, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychology+professor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychology professor&lt;/a&gt; and researcher at Mila–Quebec AI Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM's Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine's effect on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain "criticality" during sleep. Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos," said Jerbi. "It's like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there's cacophony. Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: It can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier added, "Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive. While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night; the brain would neither relax nor recover properly."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier's team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram. They compared each participant's brain activity on two separate nights—one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We used advanced statistical analysis and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity," said Thölke, the study's first author. "The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that's crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain's electrical rhythms during sleep: Caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves—generally associated with deep, restorative sleep—and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine," says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging. "This change in the brain's rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt; between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine's ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants," Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine. Given caffeine's widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caffeine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; intake.&lt;/p&gt;

The rush of heat, the pounding heart, and the urges to shout or slam a door feel almost automatic. Most of us just want lash out and vent, hoping the anger will be gone as fast as it came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, people have sworn by “getting it out,” whether by screaming into a pillow or pummeling a punching bag. Others swear by the opposite approach: pause, breathe, let it pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scientific sweep of the evidence puts these rival tactics head-to-head – and crowns a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-venting-anger-myth-loses-steam"&gt;The ‘venting anger’ myth loses steam&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second paragraph, it’s time to meet the researchers. Communication scholar &lt;a href="https://comm.osu.edu/people/bushman.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Bushman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; has spent years testing the notion of catharsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venting anger might sound like a good idea, but it’s actually counterproductive,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team, working with postdoctoral fellow &lt;a href="https://sophiekja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophie Kjærvik&lt;/a&gt;, combed through 154 different studies with more than 10,000 people to sort myth from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review shows that activities lowering bodily arousal – deep breathing, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-protects-against-work-stress-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-slows-biological-aging-at-the-molecular-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, even slow, controlled yoga – consistently push anger levels down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting hardly matters; results hold for solo exercises at home, therapist-guided sessions, and app-based programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing arousal – and actually the physiological aspect of it – is really important,” Kjærvik explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-say"&gt;What the numbers say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kjærvik’s meta-analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/em&gt;, found that every group studied – college students, retirees, people with intellectual disabilities, and individuals with criminal records – benefited from arousal-decreasing strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, jogging, hitting a bag, or smashing plates in a rage room showed little effect or even nudged anger upward. “To reduce anger, it is better to engage in activities that decrease arousal levels,” Bushman notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of this size are rare in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotion research&lt;/a&gt;. By pooling so many participants, the team could spot small but steady patterns that single experiments miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consistency across gender, age, and cultural background signals that calming the body is a universal recipe, not a fad tied to one social-media trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-beats-cardio"&gt;Calm beats cardio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would a brisk run fail where a quiet breath succeeds? Anger already revs the sympathetic nervous system – the body’s gas pedal. Adding more acceleration simply keeps the engine roaring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they’re definitely not the best way to reduce anger,” Bushman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/yoga-can-reduce-stress-and-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offers an intriguing twist. Though poses raise heart rate, the practice embeds steady breathing and focused attention, turning movement into meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really interesting to see that progressive muscle relaxation and relaxation in general might be as effective as approaches such as mindfulness and meditation,” Kjærvik noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And yoga, which can be more arousing than meditation and mindfulness, is still a way of calming and focusing on your breath that has a similar effect in reducing anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-body-s-alarm-system"&gt;Inside the body’s alarm system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger sparks a full-body alert: faster heartbeat, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, surging adrenaline. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system primes muscles for fight or flight, while its calmer twin – the parasympathetic branch – waits to dial everything back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techniques that lengthen exhales or tense and release muscles flip that switch sooner, cooling the system before words or fists fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think this quick reset evolved because it lets social groups resolve conflicts without lasting harm. Lowering arousal gives the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-pathways-identified-as-being-unique-to-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – our planning center – time to weigh consequences, recall past regrets, and choose words more carefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payoff is fewer broken dishes, lower stress hormones, and relationships that bounce back instead of break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-anger-without-venting"&gt;Reducing anger without venting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps offering guided breathing now sit within arm’s reach, many of them free of charge. A simple routine – inhale for four counts, exhale for six – can drop heart rate within a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cycles of progressive muscle relaxation ease shoulder knots that broadcast irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute mindfulness session on YouTube can do the same job as a longer appointment when time is tight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression,” Bushman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For situations demanding movement, try a slow walk around the block. Keep the pace easy enough to hold a steady conversation. Pair it with attention to your surroundings – the hum of cicadas, the scent of fresh-cut grass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle motion helps metabolize &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-rise-during-sleep-to-prepare-your-body-for-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; without driving arousal higher, and nature’s small details pull focus away from rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unchecked anger strains marriages, work teams, and the cardiovascular system. Over months, it can hardwire aggressive habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new review shows there’s nothing inevitable about that spiral; swapping venting for calming returns control to the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most interventions cost little or nothing, workplaces, prisons, and schools can roll them out without red tape. Even a coach’s whistle can cue athletes to pause for three slow breaths before play resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can apply the same thinking at home. Instead of sending a child to “go punch a pillow,” suggest three balloon-slow breaths, a sip of water, and a quiet corner until color fades from their cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling the strategy yourself teaches by example and keeps the living room peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling down trumps blowing up. Evidence from more than 10,000 volunteers says so, and the message holds whether you are nine or ninety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time fury rises, skip the punching bag and breathe. Your heart – and everyone within earshot – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735824000357?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOTERJMGpmZE9UNi1ZeVJRcDFic0xZMVlkenJKVnBJWVpQMVlfMU11cXV4bzQ5V0paemprSUU4N3NBWXlUYTNKb2hva294MEpIMlBiVkcxZ0M5dEFfVTRIZ3M1QjJPcGxHOGo4bldKamJqSDgtdS1mVktPMnNsZzlNVmdjUkJTaFgxVXNqaGNRSW1KZ3Z4MTBRNVQzVzN1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Lilly Jay博士从未要求成为焦点，但她已经准备好发声了- glamour.com | Dr. Lilly Jay Never Asked for the Spotlight—But She’s Ready to Speak Up - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the moment, she thinks, to use her public voice for good. So Dr. Jay has decided to join the medical board of a science-backed parenting platform, Riley, in order to help bring its suite of mental-health support resources to more parents nationwide. The app, which was previously only available in beta mode via a waitlist, is open to the public as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda DeLuca founded &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE"}' href="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Riley&lt;/a&gt; in November 2023 after her own experience with postpartum depression. When DeLuca, a former Etsy and NerdWallet product lead, was in the throes of her mental-health struggle following the 2022 birth of her daughter, she recalls spending hours doomscrolling the internet, simmering in her myriad anxieties of what could happen to her baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not an uncommon experience—many moms admit spending way too much time googling their fears plus using Reddit, then spiraling down a rabbit hole of toxicity that makes their condition worse, not better. What Riley aims to do, DeLuca tells me, is provide a science-based, all-in-one parental advisory platform to provide support that reduces the mental load of constant optimization and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you should be getting out of using the app is just more joyful time with your children and feeling more confident, making good decisions, and spending quality time with them,” DeLuca tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more plainly, helping parents to put down their phones. It’s one of the things that Dr. Jay sees in her practice that she wants to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a clinician, I hear so many patients contend with the constant work of trying to sort through the entire internet’s worth of knowledge about parenting,” she says. “Then they get to a point where they’re too exhausted to do anything with the information, and they’ve also lost a lot of time and either maintained or amplified their own anxieties in the constant searching. Getting a good clear answer that you can do something with, and is in conversation with whatever you are still tracking about your baby, frees you up to get back to the important work that will never be replaced by an app, which is parenting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking publicly about these issues, Dr. Jay thinks, is a first step to determining what this next phase of her life will look like. She grows most passionate when speaking about the myriad of crises facing her patients and American mothers at large, noting that our country currently has “maternal mortality and morbidity rates, especially for women of color, that are unconscionable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of her resources and privilege, Jay says, when she gave birth to her son she was not always believed when she talked about what she was experiencing in her own body. In the hospital, she repeatedly told her medical team that she felt something was wrong, only to be told she simply had a headache from the dry hospital air. She actually had preeclampsia, a dangerous and serious pregnancy complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dr. Jay, something needs to change, starting with making our health care system “more responsive to the full complexity of pregnancy.” It will not only make women safer; it will also make them better mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 19:07:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY</guid></item><item><title>健康回报： RFK Jr.的新冠疫苗建议变更可能威胁健康，获取- CNBC | Healthy Returns: RFK Jr.’s Covid vaccine recommendation change could threaten health, access - CNBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-articleBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="SpecialReportArticle-articleBody-6-2"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-hidden"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of outrage is sweeping the scientific and medical world after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/cdc-ends-covid-vaccine-recommendation-for-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women.html"&gt;stop recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday said the Covid shot has been removed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for those groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another Covid shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;on X. He offered no scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Kennedy's latest move to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the federal agencies that regulate and recommend shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/fda-stricter-covid-vaccine-approval.html"&gt;set stricter standards&lt;/a&gt; for approving shots for healthy Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health experts say the dropped recommendation could have devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are considered to be at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk of severe &lt;/a&gt;complications from Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC's website. That can include&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." target="_blank"&gt; preterm labor and birth&lt;/a&gt;, heart injury, blood clots and kidney damage among pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID-19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection," Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that "the science has not changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit," Fleischman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm#:~:text=Maternal%20vaccination%20during%20pregnancy%20has%20been%20shown,months%2C%20including%20those%20who%20are%20pregnant%20(8%2C9)" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from the virus for pregnant women and infants younger than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischman and other experts also raised concerns about whether patients will have access to vaccines following Kennedy's decision. The CDC's recommendation is crucial because it guides insurance plans on which shots to cover at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare and Medicaid require that the recommended vaccines are free for patients. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC's outside committee of vaccine advisors and director.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Children without insurance can get free recommended vaccines through the government-run Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are charging up to $150 per dose for their respective Covid shots before insurance, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families," Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/new-covid-vaccine-recommendations-threaten-access-undermine-choice-and-will-negatively-impact-health/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan added that process for Kennedy's decision breaks with the precedent of letting federal panels of experts publicly debate scientific evidence and vote on immunization practices. A group of external advisors to the CDC typically gives vaccine advice to the agency's director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's nominee to lead the CDC, acting director Susan Monarez, still needs Senate confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall," Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the decision could "strip families of choice," preventing those who want to vaccinate from getting shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Hinge Health makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108149556" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Hinge Health Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the company's initial public offering (IPO) in New York, US, on Thursday, May 22, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear that? That was the sound of the digital health sector breathing a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital physical therapy company &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last week &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;the sector's first major public exit in several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader tech IPO market has been in a drought since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. And within digital health, there's been practically no IPO activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge, founded in 2014, uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, as well as carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock opened at $39.25 on Thursday, rising 23% from its $32 IPO price. It closed up 17% at $37.56 a share, bringing its market capitalization to more than $3 billion. As of Wednesday afternoon, shares are trading at more than $41. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its IPO, Hinge had raised more than $1 billion from investors including Insight Partners, Atomico, Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts will officially kick off coverage of the stock around 30 days after its debut. But analysts at Roth shared some initial thoughts about Hinge earlier this month, before it went public. Importantly, they did not participate in the offering, make a recommendation or initiate coverage in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We watched HNGE's IPO roadshow presentation and were impressed by the AI products underpinning the platform and rate of care expansion," including beyond musculoskeletal conditions, the analysts said in a note on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge said that revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year. The company reported $117.3 million in revenue during its fourth quarter, up 44% from the same period in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roth analysts said the company's recent fundamentals are encouraging, including its accelerating revenues and billings as well as its improved operating margins. Some of the risks facing the company include the competitive digital therapy landscape, its reliance on peer-reviewed data and regulatory overhang, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hinge's debut, another digital health company is preparing to join the fray. Omada Health filed for an IPO earlier this month, though it has yet to share more details about its expected pricing or timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omada offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions like prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we did with Hinge, we'll be following this offering closely, so stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 18:56:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR</guid></item></channel></rss>
