    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may only experience shortness of breath and fatigue, while others may only experience brain fog and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9779497/Blood-test-spot-long-Covid-ready-SIX-MONTHS.html" class=""&gt;diagnosing long Covid&lt;/a&gt; is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal PLOS One, looked at 17 patients aged 25 to 60 who were previously infected with Covid at least six months prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants included 10 people diagnosed with Long Covid and seven who healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All but one patient were female, and the average age was 42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants completed interviews about their lingering symptoms, which could have included brain fog, memory issues, fatigue, anxiety or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed cognitive tests to evaluate processing speed, language, learning and memory, problem solving, multitasking and concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also drew blood samples from each participant to test elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts found Long Covid patients had 33 percent lower levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in their brains, a protein that helps maintain neurons in the brain and central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low NGF levels have been associated with neurocognitive conditions like Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid patients also had 50 percent more interleukin 10, a protein that helps regulate inflammation and immune responses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though interleukin 10 normally controls inflammation, high levels can have the opposite effect and create more inflammation in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine in 10 participants in the Long Covid group had elevated inflammatory markers like interleukin 10 compared to one of out the seven healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Long Covid patients scored 30 percent lower on tests of language processing, suggesting Long Covid triggers inflammation in the brain's language centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found Long Covid patients were 75 percent more likely than healthy patients to suffer a worsened quality of life overall. They also had a 61 percent increased risk of suffering general pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alison Cohen, an epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at the University of California San Francisco, never imagined Long Covid would upend her life. But three years after getting Covid, she can hardly run or make a long drive before feeling ill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Violet Affleck — seen with father Ben Affleck and stepmother Jennifer Lopez — has been outspoken about contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019. She has called on local governments ' to confront the long Covid crisis'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest Long Covid symptoms are caused by increased inflammatory markers in the brain and lower levels of NGF, which would normally protect neurons and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This increased inflammation may damage parts of the brain responsible for language processing, as well as those that regulate pain and depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lawrence said: 'Additional services such as speech therapy, psychotherapy for stress reduction and incorporating medications that target fatigue and mental fogginess could all be elements of creating a successful treatment plan as well.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted while the study is small and has several limitations, including most participants being female and white, they hope to conduct larger studies to confirm the findings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Judith Arnetz, corresponding study author and professor emerita at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, said: 'Although this is a small study and more work needs to be done, from a clinical application standpoint, physicians potentially can identify individuals who are struggling sooner and provide wrap-around care that could be helpful to them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 18:00:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPWFQzY0RaSVdYMmVDTTlrSjEybENuUHItOW1ncFlza1gwR2tfazh0VzBRRXliWVRmdkwzVmtFWmhNLTBEaEhtMjdrbEVDTVJCQXlKYnI5ajN6NHhjb1R0Z21jN0JXR21yb1NpaHRHQktWb0ZhOEVIbDgtdUJDWHB2RmtZc1QzQnVucElMeHppQkdLeWZBZ1JSR0JYN1NTT1ZjUEkyTks0c1cxc21GTEpXTtIBtgFBVV95cUxPWkJ4U01PbVpmd1AzWGhiRWdXUEl4enl3T3J6UXd6NmI5eERYaW5ybWJVT1NGY2UxOUk4U2J1bUJDWkRqNk91ZXJEZ1oyWEQwZVZYTkRNNWNERDF0MkdjYjJucDM4NEhZU01IZFNVSEdyY1VpRGNXeTV2OWJycHFtNktWS3lCRGNxYndSd3IwN284TmFPUGpzVmZDVkxqZDNuSVhWNkJWVEtNdG1pMldMWjhOZlN6dw</guid></item><item><title>患有抑郁症和多动症的母亲因怀孕而停药-伤口 | The Mom With Depression and ADHD Who Went Off Her Meds for Pregnancy - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNU1BDanhUV09lUUFSM256SGlSNUthZDdmS0kxanktUER4VGZ2NDByaU1wckV4NHcxazQ4UUVXNURFSHBuNXdjaWtYUGJ4UEJwSXE5RWhrZEdDbTZTN2otRDQ1NkwtcUY0SDd2UzJGX2pYRXpNUmxRdHVhSEhrZEVYWHRlSXl6VWc4OFRhSzdMa3ZiaVFSZWFMeERMZmVKZXdDNjJMOGh2NA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyoga001e3b6dlo7aujuv@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For instance, Kristen became obsessed with two specific foods — Alfredo sauce and white chocolate — until one day she never wanted to consume either food ever again. She was also passionate about learning the flute and couldn’t get enough of practicing. But the day she finally grew tired of it, she broke her instrument so she could no longer play it at all. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyom0001j3b6djbaxx5l9@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Kristen grew up, she overcame this behavior — and she thought she was managing adulthood well, successfully holding down a career in communications. Still, she noticed her energy evaporated after about five hours of being awake. “If I got up at 7 a.m., I’d long for my bed by noon and feel &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/i-have-zero-motivation-to-do-my-job.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;unmotivated to accomplish anything &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;on my to-do list,” Kristen says. “I also got easily worked up, stressed, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mental-health-managing-dysregulated-nervous-system-essay.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;overstimulated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by small things.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogg001f3b6d9dlqjxfq@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;&lt;em&gt;By 2021, she had become emotionally unavailable to her partner, Kai, whom she had known since she was 14. She no longer wanted to get out of bed at all. “One day Kai asked me, ‘When was the last time you got out of the house?’” Kristen recalls. That was the moment she realized that something was wrong. She had only been going out about once a month. “COVID was going on, but I wasn’t completely scared of getting sick. It was the production of going out. I didn’t have the battery,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyom4001k3b6d3go3hlab@published" data-word-count="23"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kai persuaded her to speak to a psychiatrist. Soon after, Kristen was diagnosed with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/paris-hilton-adhd-music-video.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;severe combination ADHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/should-i-disclose-my-depression-to-my-employer.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; disorder, and anxiety with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ambition-work-ocd.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OCD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogl001g3b6drvifd8ay@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was genuinely a relief,” she says. “I felt validated that what I was feeling was not unique, and also not in my head.” She started weekly therapy and was prescribed a few medications: short-acting and extended-release methylphenidates to treat her ADHD, and bupropion and sertraline to treat her depression. This combination of treatments helped a lot. “Kai saw a spark come back into my eyes. He said that following me in conversations became a lot easier, too. He wasn’t texting me, ‘Wut? Please explain’ as much.” For the first time in her life, Kristen says she could focus and take on more without overburdening herself.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyoh8001i3b6deyiauwrn@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Kristen was 29, she and Kai decided they were ready to have children — though she had doubts that it would happen easily. “We’d been together since we were teenagers and never had one pregnancy scare,” Kristen says. “I kind of felt like if I were able to get pregnant, I would have had at least one by then.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogs001h3b6dr1euyzvj@published" data-word-count="4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what happened next. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00150iiad2g78rvw@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;I’ve dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/7-women-on-what-its-like-to-have-pcos.html"&gt;irregular period&lt;/a&gt;s my whole life and, as a result, have been on birth control since I was 13 or 14. Otherwise, I’d bleed heavily twice a month for seven days straight. Because I’d been on birth control for so long, I thought I might have a hard time naturally conceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosc7jv000i3b6d6ujgmjxd@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;But in 2022, after I’d been on ADHD medication and antidepressants for a year, Kai and I decided to quit &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-fda-approves-miudella-a-new-copper-iud.html"&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; and see what happened. We didn’t want to put too much pressure on ourselves, so we said that we were “not trying, but trying” to get pregnant. Since I wasn’t sure it was ever going to happen, I kept taking all my medications.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00170iia7jurkpbk@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;About a year after stopping birth control, I woke up with heartburn. I’ve never had heartburn in my life. I messaged my friend and she goes, “I used to get that when I was pregnant.” And I was like, “What? No way.” I realized that I’d had cramps the week before, right around the time I was supposed to get my period, and that now I was late. A few days passed, and I was finally like, “Let me take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000r3b6dhd9frnlw@published" data-word-count="126"&gt;I took a pregnancy test that morning and put it next to my desk in my home office to wait for the results. Then I checked my email and found out that I had been &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/laid-off-but-still-working.html"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt;. I then turned my head and saw that the pregnancy test was positive. I didn’t believe it. I convinced myself that one of my antidepressants was causing a false positive result. I’d read online how that could happen. But if there’s one thing I am good at, it’s being thorough, so I Instacarted four different pregnancy tests to my house. It was just like that scene in &lt;em&gt;Knocked Up&lt;/em&gt;. I had the digital, I had the one with little lines, I had different brands. All the results were positive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000s3b6djz3gzfix@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;I was like, “What the hell is happening?” It was super exciting, but I had so many emotions. Since we’d been trying for so long, I’d resigned myself to not being able to get pregnant. It was almost hard to believe that I was. Kai works in finance and called me on his way home from the office. He was like, “You’ve been silent all day. Something’s going on.” I started crying again and was like, “I’m pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000t3b6dxue90uhy@published" data-word-count="25"&gt;He was overjoyed the moment I told him, which helped me become more excited too. But a lot of panic and stress also set in.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00190iiau52mimfs@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;Coincidentally, I had a psychiatrist appointment scheduled on the day I found out I was pregnant. He said I’d need to cut the dosage of one of my antidepressants in half. Kai wasn’t comfortable with me staying on the other antidepressant because he worried about an increased risk of birth defects and preterm birth, so I stopped that one completely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscybm00113b6dsqpaquu2@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;As for my ADHD meds, my psychiatrist told me there wasn’t enough medical research to prove whether or not they could be passed along to the baby, so we were going to do everything by the books and stop them. We didn’t want to introduce my child to anything that could be detrimental to them in the long haul or cause withdrawal. My OB/GYN agreed with the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscybm00123b6d4kflxopt@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I trusted my doctors’ judgment, but the shock of finding out I was pregnant and losing my job was also really hitting me. I couldn’t get out of bed for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosd9sv001h3b6dksvyrp57@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;My ADHD medication gives me a little mental boost to be like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, I have clarity about my day&lt;/em&gt;, and, &lt;em&gt;I’m not gonna have all this anxiety. I know where my path forward is.&lt;/em&gt; When I stopped them, I didn’t have that anymore. The half-dose of sertraline helped stabilize my mood a little, but it was still easy for me to go deep into my thoughts and spin my wheels. You could see a lot of worry on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdeef001p3b6dxs1urh12@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I started looking for a new job right away, but it was hard to collect my thoughts. I would get so distracted all the time. Like, I’d say, “I’m gonna clean this room,” and then all of a sudden, it would be two in the afternoon, and I hadn’t cleaned anything because I got distracted looking at items in a box.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdt1100243b6djygpoheo@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;I quickly became extremely tired. I found myself unable to leave the house anytime after 4 p.m. I was typically in bed between before 10 p.m. each night, sleeping until sometime between 7 and 8 a.m. I only allowed myself one eight-ounce cup of coffee versus the normal two to three cups I had come to depend on prepregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdui8002c3b6d6s9o1f6p@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I started doing a lot of creative things that you wouldn’t normally find me doing, and because I was unmedicated, it was mass chaos. Learning to knit did not go well. I tried to get back into creative writing, but I struggled to put together a cohesive sentence. I wanted to become an influencer on TikTok, but I couldn’t settle on an angle. I also tried to kick off tons of DIY projects, like redesigning my home office. Those fell flat, too.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaose4gc002r3b6dcdy9v74c@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;In July, I landed another communications job. I knew it wasn’t a natural fit for me, but I took it as a matter of convenience, for both the maternity leave and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseape002z3b6dlbv8dhfl@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;My doctor told me the second trimester was often easier for a lot of people with ADHD and I noticed that. Like when it came to nesting, I was able to concentrate because it was a hyperfixation. I did in-depth cleaning, built out a bunch of to-do lists, and got into the weeds of pregnancy Reddit boards. That worked to my benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00303b6dbknyceo5@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;Our baby shower was a whole production. It was the weekend of Halloween, and Kai and I dressed up as Jack and Sally from &lt;em&gt;The Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;. We developed &lt;em&gt;Family Feud&lt;/em&gt;–style games, hired a DJ — things you normally don’t have for a baby shower. We had a Christmas tree, a decorating station for ornaments, a face painter … I love a theme, and I dived into it because I wasn’t as regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00313b6d0abmxqqi@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;On the flip side, I lost or forgot a lot of stuff. I once had to drive an hour home to get a set of keys that I forgot. When I’m medicated, my mind is like &lt;em&gt;I Spy&lt;/em&gt;, and I can recall things and know where they go. But pregnant and without my medication, I was getting lost in a paper bag.&lt;/p&gt;

He kept saying that this wasn’t easy, but I was more than capable of doing it. He reminded me to be kind to myself as well. Still, it was very evident to those I love that I was a good version of myself, but not my “usual best.”&lt;/p&gt;

As a kid, I’d get really hurt, cry for like 20 minutes, and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;

I genuinely thought contractions were going to be electrifying. But to me, they felt like severe but manageable gas pains. By the time I started feeling them and made my way to my doctor’s office, I was already nine centimeters dilated.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt complete the moment he was in my arms. I had joked throughout my pregnancy that our baby could look like Kai as long as he had my nose, so the first thing Kai said was, “He has your nose.” I was laughing and crying and couldn’t believe this tiny little being was really ours.&lt;/p&gt;

I went into panic mode, trying to figure out how to get him to eat and make sure he was okay. I was so stressed. I went down a rabbit hole online, checking with “Dr. Google,” joining a bunch of Facebook groups, texting other mom friends. I think if I’d been taking ADHD medication at the time, it would have rerouted me in a way where I could be like, &lt;em&gt;I can figure this out&lt;/em&gt;. But I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t feel the difference immediately. I felt like I was running on fumes.&lt;/p&gt;

I was calling my friends crying, and yelling at Kai — I could be pretty vicious. Sometimes I’d even go at my parents, who were trying to help me. I think Kai was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh shit. I gotta do more because she’s gonna have an ultimate breakdown&lt;/em&gt;. We both wanted to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

That was anxiety-inducing. Not only was I exhausted and sleep-deprived and caring for a little human, but timing a pump schedule! But I needed my medication in order to want to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

It was 100 percent a relief. When I’m not medicated, I feel like my world is spinning. Once I take it, things start to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

And weirdly, it helped with social cues, like, better understanding my baby’s cries. I couldn’t preemptively stop him from crying, but I could think, &lt;em&gt;What is the next thing I have to do for him?&lt;/em&gt; My emotional regulation became a lot better. Before I restarted the meds, I would find myself wanting to cry more and being so easily overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

That let me wake up and have brain power. I could focus and maintain my energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

I loved feeling my baby doing circles in my stomach. I loved when I felt his hiccups. I loved having an excuse to eat what I wanted. I think it’s awesome to carry life. But I don’t know if Kai and I will have more kids. Stopping my medication was one of the hardest things I’ve done. I am extremely fortunate to be back on my meds and in therapy. It’s helped me understand on an even deeper level that doing what’s best for me enables me to do what’s best for our son.&lt;/p&gt;

While the average duration of ADHD medication was over three years, a quarter of treated children remained on it for over seven, and some for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread and increasing use, long-term safety data from controlled clinical trials only extend to one year. Researchers stress the need for more rigorous studies and annual reassessments, urging caution when prescribing medications to children at sensitive developmental stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prolonged Use:&lt;/strong&gt; A quarter of children stayed on ADHD meds for over 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys started younger and stayed on medication longer than girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; No controlled clinical trials have assessed safety beyond 1 year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Turku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of ADHD medication has increased notably in recent years, but its long-term effects in children have not been sufficiently studied, despite years of use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent population-based register study found that the average duration of ADHD medication treatment for Finnish children and adolescents was over three years. In the quarter of children with the longest duration of ADHD medication treatment, the treatment lasted more than seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109971"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child, a calendar and pill bottles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The longest duration of ADHD medication was for boys who started medication at the age of 6–8 years. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important research opening, as the duration of long-term use of ADHD medication in children and adolescents in everyday life has only been studied to a very limited extent,” says the study lead Päivi Ruokoniemi, a Specialist in both Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Child Psychiatry from the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Boys treated more often and for longer periods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that both gender and the age at which ADHD medication is started have a significant effect on the duration of treatment. On average, ADHD treatment lasted just over a year longer for boys than for girls. For both genders, an early age of onset led to longer medication treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longest duration of ADHD medication was for boys who started medication at the age of 6–8 years. The median duration of their medication treatment was 6.3 years, and for a quarter of them the treatment lasted more than 9.4 years. This group was also the largest group to start ADHD medication. Boys aged 6 to 8 accounted for 32.4 percent of the study subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that a significant proportion of young children, especially boys, are on ADHD medication for years, throughout their comprehensive school years. In this context, it is worrying that reliable research data on the safety of these medicines is only available for a follow-up period of up to one year. After all, we are talking about children at a very sensitive stage of development,” says Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Studies on long-term effects lacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most reliable evidence for the safety of medicines comes from clinical, controlled, and randomised trials. For the regulatory approval of ADHD medications, the European Medicines Agency requires pharmaceutical companies to establish clinical safety with a study covering at least one year of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term effects of ADHD medicines have been studied extensively in various observational and uncontrolled research settings, but these are always prone to confounding and therefore do not provide reliable information on cause-and-effect relationships,” continues Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Due to these uncertainties, it is important that ADHD medication is only started when non-pharmacological treatments have been deemed insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even in this case, it must be ensured that both the caregiver and the child, in accordance with the child’s age and level of development, have access to sufficient information on the expected benefits and harms of the medicine and the uncertainties associated with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also recommend that the need for ADHD medication that has already been started should be reviewed annually by a medical doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The descriptive register study, recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, was carried out as a research collaboration between the Universities of Turku and Helsinki and the Finnish Social Insurance Institution Kela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data used in the study was from the register of dispensations reimbursable under the National Health Insurance Scheme for the years 2008–2019. The data included nearly 41,000 children and young people who had started medication treatment in Finland. The duration of medication treatment was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the last year of the study data, the prevalence of ADHD medication was 5–6 percent for boys and 1.3–1.5 percent for girls. Since then, the use of ADHD medication has continued to increase both globally and also in Finland, where the increase has been even faster than in other Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that the proportion of Finnish children and adolescents using ADHD medication in Finland has already doubled since the years we conducted our research,” says Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#45262a2828302b2c2624312c2a2b36053031306b232c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-025-02735-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duration of ADHD medication treatment among Finnish children and adolescents ‒ a nationwide register study&lt;/a&gt;” by Päivi Ruokoniemi et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of ADHD medication treatment among Finnish children and adolescents ‒ a nationwide register study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Aim&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the duration of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication treatment among children and adolescents by sex and age group in Finland during 2008–2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive, population-based register study covering all Finnish children and adolescents aged 6–18 years who initiated their first ADHD medication treatment period between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40691). To establish the duration of use we collected data from the register of Dispensations reimbursable under the National Health Insurance Scheme register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median follow-up time was 3.8 years (Q1 = 1.7, Q3 = 7.1). Treatment duration was calculated as the interval between the date of the first and last purchase with a cut-off of 365 days allowed between purchases. The durations were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median duration of ADHD medication treatment was 3.2 years (95% CI 3.2, 3.3, Q1 = 1.0 95% CI 0.9, 1.0, Q3 = 6.8 95% CI 6.7, 7.0). Sex and age significantly influenced treatment duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.0001 and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.0001). Boys had longer treatment duration than girls and the younger the subject, the longer the duration of usage. Boys aged 6–8 years (32.4% of the subjects) exhibited the longest treatment duration with a median of 6.3 years (95% CI 6.2, 6.5, Q1 = 2.6 95% CI 2.5, 2.7, Q3 = 9.4 years 95% CI 9.2, 9.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of ADHD medication treatment among children in the real-world clinical setting goes well beyond the data available from randomized controlled trials and extends for several years especially among young boys.&lt;/p&gt;

in each lung, plus two beside her heart, and tumors in her spine, lymph nodes and adrenal glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so widespread – it’s everywhere,’ the Toronto-based nanny said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2023, she detected a single lump adjacent to her right breast, which she brushed off as 'just a cyst.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It looked more like an ingrown hair or an under-the-skin pimple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when Engle continued to find new lumps forming in different areas, she knew something was amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors discovered after an X-ray that the lumps were miniature tumors all over her body after cancerous skin cells had spread through her bloodstream to other organs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back, other symptoms she brushed off were clearly linked: unintentional weight gain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until learning that she has stage IV melanoma, Engle was a healthy young woman with a few benign moles that doctors had removed out of caution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors at the urgent care also believed the lumps were relatively benign cysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But X-rays confirmed the worst: the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13476403/I-diagnosed-Stage-4-skin-cancer-22-despite-having-no-visible-moles-marks-never-tanning.html"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; had invaded her lungs, bones, and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The odds of dying from the cancer are exponentially higher once it has spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just one in five patients with stage 4 melanoma are still alive five years after being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, not only is Engle still here two years later, her cancer has since stabilized and is no longer growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engle began chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments just a few days after her diagnosis in June 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Although my diagnosis is stage four and has spread almost everywhere, it still does not mean “terminal,”’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Here I am in 2025, almost two years into my stage four diagnosis, with now so many options for treatment, and they have much more hope for prolonging my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle said lumps like the one shown began appearing all over her body. Urgent care doctors first told her they were likely benign cysts. But her ongoing nausea and fatigue led her to the hospital for further testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;‘Here I am in 2025, almost two years into my stage four diagnosis, with now so many options for treatment, and they have much more hope for prolonging my life,' Engle said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of May 2025, she has received 18 rounds of an immunotherapy drug called Nivolumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engle started dual immunotherapy but stopped after two doses due to autoimmune hepatitis—a condition where the immune system attacks the liver, causing inflammation and potential damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After getting over her hepatitis, in addition to radiation treatments for tumors in her brain and eyes, Engle continued a regimen of nivolumab alone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it'll be a constant fight for rest of her life type thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Likely I could be in treatment for the rest of my life, but there are cases of people with NED (no evidence of disease),’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until learning her devastating diagnosis, Engle was a healthy young woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors had, over the years, removed several benign moles out of an abundance of caution.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moles are groupings of normal melanin-forming cells. But damage to the DNA of those cells, often through heavy exposure to UV rays, can cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle, a Toronto-based nanny, has come to terms with the fact that she will likely be on cancer medication for the rest of her life, but is confident that she will beat the survival odds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until learning her devastating diagnosis, Engle was a healthy young woman with a few benign moles that doctors had removed out of caution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells can then break away from the original tumor and enter the lymphatic system, a network of vessels throughout the body, and the bloodstream, where they can multiply and form more tumors, which were the lumps all over Engle’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I was diagnosed, I was [already] convinced I had cancer, but even so, finding out for sure was a shock,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it felt validating that I knew something was wrong with my body.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She faced a bumpy road in trying to find the cancer treatment that worked for her, including her bout of autoimmune hepatitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My girlfriend and I were out shopping when I got a call from my oncologist who said my liver ALT numbers were very high – normally they should be under 50, and mine were up to 500.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They said I needed to go to the hospital immediately for IV steroids, which I got every day for a week or so to bring the numbers down and then could eventually start treatment again once they were.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had to take a break from treatment again in October 2024 when she began suffering breathing trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An chest X-ray found the true cause – stage four melanoma [skin cancer], which had spread throughout her body, including seven tumors in her brain, and more than 20 tumors in each of her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle's future remains uncertain. Advances in immunotherapy and highly targeted therapies have accelerated over the past decade, with promising evidence that they can shrink tumors, extend survival, and, in some cases, achieve long-term remission from advanced cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the 20 tumors in each lung and the immunotherapy she was taking, doctors first feared it was a case of pneumonitis, or swelling of her lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, it was not, and doctors concluded that the life-sustaining drugs she was taking were not the cause. Rather, it was likely a result of the cancerous tumors in her lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she was placed on the steroid prednisone for months, infamous for its side effects, including agitation, ‘moon face’, and swelling elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toronto is a hub for medical innovation, allowing Engle access to the most cutting-edge treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will soon undergo a blood test that will screen for specific indications like tumor mutations or immune markers, which will determine whether she is suitable for Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte therapy (TIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It uses her own immune cells found within her tumors, which are extracted and taken to a lab where scientists isolate a mix of immune cells – mostly T cells – that had infiltrated the tumors but were overtaken by the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists then multiply them exponentially and place them in bioreactors that infuse them with nutrients and growth factors, creating an army of immune cells that are reinfused into Engle’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘[It] isn’t approved in Canada yet, but the US drug company has agreed for me to get compassionate treatment here before it’s approved for trial in Canada, which will be done by my oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle, shown entering the MRI machine, has received 18 rounds of an immunotherapy drug called Nivolumab. The results were mixed initially, with some tumors shrinking and some growing. But most lesions have stabilized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My oncologist thinks it could be an amazing option and I could likely continue my immunotherapy afterwards if needed!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her future remains uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advances in immunotherapy and highly targeted therapies have accelerated over the past decade, with promising evidence that they can shrink tumors, extend survival, and, in some cases, achieve long-term remission from advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I will try anything to let me live a full life,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I'm just enjoying every day as much as I can and I have a lot of hope for the future, whether that be treatment ongoing, or becoming cancer free, which is the ideal goal for me – and which I know I can achieve eventually.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mole that becomes itchy, painful or tender should not be ignored. Additionally, moles that 'bleed, become sore, or start to weep fluid' are alarming signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key warning signs of a potentially cancerous mole include rapid growth, color changes, and irregular shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mole that grows noticeably within weeks, develops multiple or uneven colors (such as brown, black, red, white, or blue), or becomes asymmetrical should be evaluated by a doctor, as these changes may indicate skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirty percent of melanoma cases starts in moles, but there are a small percentage of cases that can't be traced back to one site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 105,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in 2024, and roughly four percent will be stage four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma kills more than 8,300 Americans each year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF), but about 90 percent of cases are considered to be preventable through vigilance about sun safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of diagnosis is 63 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under 30, and has been increasing 'dramatically' over the past three decades, according to Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 15:44:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxONnZQM3NLbzFDUkNKNjM5eGxKV1VENkt3UHFMNzBzMWxMTS02OVlvb3ZfamNZcUdIdm1odkVxMm5PNzdoOEdmVmxlTUJsZGhIUnZvcHJoV2dSSWx5bjNvLXMxdEozSlN6T0l2N3ZCeFN1TUkyMWZqdDF2eVYyQV9tdExXNjNsSk9XeUNpTV9LUkRQRmZUbFpVQjhxenRKUmN5T0xJNkl6bDRuaHhOOUZyRGNueHhwNjlCclRkN0o5aW1mNU9tdWVmMnJXZWg</guid></item><item><title>亲爱的Annie ：我担心我妻子已经放弃了生活，我无能为力- NJ.com | Dear Annie: I’m concerned that my wife has given up on life and there’s nothing I can do to help - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TM4FWDFGBZDLPJ4YBHNWF5Q2FM"&gt;DEAR ANNIE: I am concerned that my wife has given up on life and there is nothing I can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ODYZOBHYREE7MXWNW3UXODYTU"&gt;For background, I am a 67-year-old man, and my wife is around the same age.

She is at high risk for cardiovascular problems, based on family history. She was put on a statin and something for blood pressure. She has asthma and frequent coughing spells. Over time, she has repeatedly resisted medical testing. She has never had a mammogram or a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2OBARKBOKJBSVNU5GXX2BARPPE"&gt;More recently, she started to develop some kind of neurological symptoms. I got her to go to a neurologist and the preliminary screening suggested possible Parkinson’s. A second neuro appointment was inconclusive. They referred her for an MRI or some type of scan, and at that point, she refused to go further in finding out what was wrong. Since then, her ability to stand and walk have gotten worse. She can only walk short distances with assistance. She needs help getting in and out of bed or a chair. She cannot get in or out of the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6XC7Z42IGFEVVP5URKSGQWDNP4"&gt;Every effort I have made to help her has been frustrated. She has not been to a doctor for years, going back before the COVID epidemic. She no longer gets refills for her medications, and she doesn’t take them anyway. We had the bath tub modified to help her step into it. She has not used it since it was completed. I had a stair lift installed to help her get up and down the stairs. She has never used it and asked me to get it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NF5FBOQGYNE7XOCPJBBP2K4I4Y"&gt;The combination of physical problems means that that she is at risk of death or injury almost all the time. She could die of heart attack or stroke. She has frequent choking or near-choking incidents, almost every time she eats. And every trip up or downstairs, or a trip from bed to the bathroom could mean a fall and serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7ZBTGRB3UNFLHGWDLOAVJ45DCA"&gt;I have just about given up on trying to convince her to do anything about her medical condition.

This is episode 3 of our series “The C-Word: Stories of Cancer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today we start with a question: How far would you go to keep a secret for someone you love? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Would you risk their life? Support their lies until it was too late? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barrett Rollins did that for his wife, Jane. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane hid her advanced breast cancer until she collapsed at work, unable to breathe. And here‘s the wrinkle: They’re both world class oncologists. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Now, what would compel two cancer doctors to keep a secret like that? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reasons are complex — and mystifying — and 10 years after Jane‘s death, Barrett still wrestles with them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barrett and Jane worked together at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute here in Boston. He recounts Jane‘s tragic story in a recent book called “In Sickness: A Memoir.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I asked Barrett the question that had been bugging me since I read the book: How? How did Jane hide her illness for so long? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barrett Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; That’s the critical question, isn’t it? How could she have hidden something so prominent from her husband and from everybody else and from all the doctors that she worked with? I think it’s important to understand that this book is not just a book about cancer and somebody’s cancer journey, it’s also a book about a marriage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Maybe it was more complicated than some other marriages, but all marriages I think at some level are complicated. We had about 20 years of a really, really great marriage. And then all of a sudden, 20 years in, things changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane became a little more withdrawn, all intimacy stopped. After a while, it just became easier for me to sleep in another room, and I never really understood why. I had to make a decision: Do I stay with her? Do I object? Do I leave? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was just completely in love with her. We had a wonderful relationship in every other domain, so I decided to stick it out. It’s a complicated story as you know from reading the book. About five years after that, Jane unwillingly revealed her diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; This is where she collapsed in the bathroom. Tell that story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; We had a pretty set routine. We worked really hard during the week. I was still working on the weekends, but Jane just totally shut off on the weekends and she would spend most of the weekends in bed. We were in our own little bubble, very hermetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was puttering around on a Saturday morning and I suddenly heard her call out from the bathroom and she said, “I need you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I knocked and came in and I was confronted with this sight of my wife lying on the floor of our bathroom. She was dressed in her usual Saturday outfit, which was a long caftan dress, sort of from her neck to her toes, but it had been slightly unzipped and underneath the caftan, on one shoulder, was a towel. I could see that the towel was beginning to be soaked in blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “My God, what’s happening?” And Jane said, “I’m dying.” Very matter of fact, “I’m dying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And I said, “What are you talking about, you’re dying.” She said, “I have breast cancer. It’s starting to bleed and I’m dying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “Well, you know, I gotta call 911,” and she said, “Don’t.” And I said “Don’t be ridiculous.” It ended up being a shouting match. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She ultimately said, “If you call 911, I will never forgive you and I will never speak to you again.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; She would rather die on the bathroom floor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Absolutely. And she made it clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here‘s where my accommodating personality accommodated. I sat down, she had brought the newspaper in with her. I said, “What do you want me to do?” She said, “Well, just read to me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I can still remember sitting on the toilet seat with her on the floor. I read most of the first section of the New York Times to her. How pathetic is that? This was while she‘s telling me that she‘s dying, but of course she wasn’t dying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bleeding stopped after about 30 to 45 minutes. She checked the wound. She saw she wasn’t bleeding, and said, “Okay, everything’s fine. You can go now.” I said, “Well, I can’t go now. We have to talk about this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We‘re never gonna talk about this.” That’s what she said. And again, “If you bring this up, I will leave you and I will never forgive you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So for the next four or five years, I was complicit in her desire to hide what was going on. I was complicit to the extent that I could convince myself there was no problem. I really kind of believed that everything was fine until another medical emergency, about five years after that, revealed her disease to the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; You spend so much of the book wrestling with Jane‘s actions and decisions, and you write that denial is too simple of an explanation. Can you talk a little bit about why you think Jane didn’t want anyone to know she was sick? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; One thing is, on the sort of personal level for Jane, she had a phobia about medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In all the years we were together, I never saw her go to the dentist. She never had a mammogram. She never had a colonoscopy. She never had a primary care physician. There was something in her that was phobic about medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are just ironies upon ironies here, right? Because she decided to go into medicine. And not just anything, she goes into cancer medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; And Dana-Farber is known for its research for finding medicines, to cure cancer or treat cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Absolutely. Not only that, but for screening and prevention, all the other things. She‘s a first responder that runs to the fire. She runs into the building. There was something in her makeup that made her want to do that, probably because she was disappointed in herself because of her phobia. So that’s one thing, put that in one category. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other thing that Jane recognized, which you may resonate with, is that when somebody gets a diagnosis of cancer, all of a sudden it’s like flipping a switch. People treat that person differently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;Yep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;There‘s this patronizing, “Oh, are you okay? What can I do for you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It was very important for Jane to be seen as strong. She saw that when people at Harvard Medical School are perceived as weak, they lose all their advantages. And she was really worried that everyone‘s attitude would change if anybody knew she had cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And then there‘s this other thing about people with cancer. They’re told, not so much by their physicians, but they’re told by society in general, now that you have cancer, your job is to be a fighter. You have to fight this thing, fight it day and night. And fighters are winners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There‘s an aspect of that that is absolutely wonderful. But what Jane objected to, was it creates a false situation in which the person with cancer, because they’re now fighters, believe they have agency. And they really don’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But if they believe they have agency over this because they’re fighting, and then through no fault of theirs, their treatment doesn’t work or the cancer that goes away comes back, what’s the implication? The implication is you’ve lost the fight. You’re a loser, you didn’t fight hard enough. Which is very, very destructive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think cancer patients have agency to the extent that they can make choices about whether or not they’re gonna get treatment. And in that respect, Jane retained agency, I think she used it incorrectly, but she retained it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And then the final thing is, and I wish it was all about this because this last thing is actually rational whereas I think most of what Jane did was irrational, Jane‘s research helped to establish the notion that people, not just patients with cancer, care more about the quality of their life than the quantity of their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over and over again when you survey people, they care about how they’re living. They would trade length for quality over and over again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even in the last year of her life, while she was bed-bound and unable to do anything, she published a really important paper in the New England Journal of Medicine about this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At that time, 10 or 12 years ago, metastatic breast cancer was not curable. She knew she couldn’t be cured and she knew just how toxic chemotherapy was in those days. It’s one of the reasons she stopped seeing patients very soon after her training was over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Her patients loved her, and she loved taking care of patients. But this notion that she was going to make somebody deathly ill by writing an order in a chart, she couldn’t stand that. She didn’t want that for herself. Now that was the most rational thing, but all these other things were also there too, and they were pretty irrational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; When reading the book, I got really mad, at first at Jane and then I got mad at you, really mad at you. Jane collapses, you don’t call 911 then you just slowly let her die of breast cancer. How did you do that? How did that happen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through the process of writing this book, you must have thought about that, right? I don’t know if you’ve thought about how that happened. You wouldn’t advise anyone to do that? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Oh my God, no. You know, you are just the latest in a long line of people who’ve said they’re really mad at me. I’ve sort of struggled to understand that, because it’s complicated. I wrote this book and I hadn’t decided to publish it right away, but I just felt it was important to write it so that I could try to understand a little bit better what had happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But then as I struggled with whether or not to publish it, I began to feel incredibly guilty about even thinking that because here‘s Jane who spent a decade hiding everything and what right did I have to display it all? It just felt like an incredible betrayal. So I was already mad at myself, but not for the reasons you were mad at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It took me a while to understand that other people were mad at me because I didn’t act the way… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;You had a responsibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I absolutely did. I had a duty to act, as her husband. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; And you’re a doctor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks. Can we get some of the reporters to come in and pile on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But you’re right, you’re absolutely right. And this is what I still feel incredibly terrible about. I haven’t resolved this, other than to understand it is in my nature to be accommodating. Not just accommodating for my own good, but I really thought I understood what it took to make this endlessly fascinating, charismatic woman, happy. I had spent decades doing that already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another way to think about my duty, is my duty was to make her as happy as I could. In a convoluted way, allowing her to die on her own terms, made her happy. So, that’s another way to think about this. I was fulfilling that responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Walker/Globe Staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Right, I did come around. It was like an emotional rollercoaster. First I was mad at Jane, then I was really mad at you. But in the end, it’s Jane‘s life, it was her choice. So I was less mad at you at the end because, right, it was her choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I also felt like your book laid bare that she made the wrong choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; She did. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I have talked to people who are, let’s say, in the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. camp, and I’ve heard somebody say, “This Harvard cancer doctor decided not to get treatment, so nobody should get treatment.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I actually did have a conversation with one person about this and said, “That’s nuts. My book shows you that it was the wrong decision.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; That’s what I took away. If you do what Jane did, then you’ll suffer more than you have to. She could still be alive today given the advance in medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; That’s possible. At the very least, her life would not have been so miserable. I write in some detail about what it took every single day to do the dressing changes; it was so complicated. It was like the invasion of Normandy, every day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She was miserable because this thing was bleeding. It got infected. It smelled bad. If she had gotten treatment, that probably wouldn’t have happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; So how unusual are “Janes” in the world of oncology? The patients who are in denial and refuse treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; It’s not that uncommon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All of us in oncology have, in the back of our minds, a small cadre of patients that we saw who would come in with long, neglected cancers of various sorts because of fear or their own phobias. Once the book was written, I started getting comments and emails from people saying, “Thank you for writing this. It reminds me of when my mother did the same thing, or reminds me of when my cousin did the same thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There is a large population of people out there who are doing this, and I think it’s one of the deficiencies that we as oncologists have lived with. We need to think more about how to reach out to people who don’t want to be seen and think that their treatment is gonna be worse than their disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There will be people who are stubborn and delusional like Jane who thought the treatment was worse than her disease, but I’m here to tell you it really wasn’t. There are other people who I think can be convinced, if we do it the right way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; So do you think people are more scared of cancer than other diseases and that’s why they put off treatment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think it’s pretty clear that people are scared of cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;And why is it so scary? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Well, I think there are a couple reasons. One is a historical reason. People are scared of what they don’t understand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you think about Tuberculosis, for example, this was a disease that was the staple of European literature for a couple centuries. If you think about what happens, people just suddenly start losing weight. They become listless. It’s kind of just tailor-made for some kind of romantic story in which Tuberculosis is a visitation for some sin this person committed either in this life or a previous life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It wasn’t until the discovery of the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis that you had a rational way to think about it. So nobody talks about this anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cancer was the same sort of thing. For centuries, nobody knew what caused cancer. It was this mystery, also of visitation, and it was organ specific. There are all sorts of myths that you can come up with about why someone might have developed cancer. We had no treatment and, again, for which we didn’t understand the origin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is really changing now with discoveries that really show what the cause is, treatments that are directed at that cause, but that’s gonna take a while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But I think the other thing that’s unique about cancer is the way it distorts the organs that it involves. It directly impacts bodily autonomy. As we go through the world, I think that we imagine ourselves as intact entities that interact with other people. Cancer attacks that intactness. It creates lumps in your breast, it creates broken bones, it creates a stroke-like syndrome if you have brain cancer. There are things that it does that destroy the sort of compactness and wholeness of the body, and I think that’s fundamentally terrifying to people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think a lot of people who either have cancer or have a certain turn of mind, can be scared to death that’s gonna happen to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;You studied medicine for decades before you encountered this experience with Jane. You write in the book about changing the dressings on her chest. It was really difficult for you to be on the other side, to be the caretaker and to be so vulnerable to a disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;How did that experience change your perspective as a doctor? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; The whole experience changed my perspective, but I’m thinking particularly about treating Jane‘s tumor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think your listeners who haven’t read the book need to know that the right side of Jane‘s chest was completely replaced by this football-sized mass. It was misshapen, parts of it were dying. It turned black. Other parts were infected and there were parts that were bleeding all the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These kinds of things always bothered me, even when I was in medical school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Squeamish to blood? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Not to blood, not to blood. This is very specific. Blood didn’t bother me and people who were very sick didn’t bother me, but there was something about big tumors that were decaying and destroying somebody’s body that made me sort of reach for the rails because I was afraid I was gonna faint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The first time I saw this was the day Jane had this event. When we were at Dana-Farber, we always had lunch together. We were on our way to lunch and she just collapsed. She‘d had a huge clot, traveled from her legs up into her lungs. When we got to the emergency room, they took off her clothes and there was this thing which I had never seen before. I sort of looked at it from a distance and I thought, “Oh, this is what she‘s talking about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My insight into this is that people can ultimately handle anything. There‘s nothing special about me. I took care of her for a year. I helped the visiting nurses change the dressings for a year. I think people should take heart in knowing that I, a kind of neurotic otherwise normal guy, could eventually step up and do all this stuff when necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And I think people are doubting their ability to do that. It should take some strength from the fact that I could do it and other people do it all the time. We should provide support for them, but people are strong enough to do this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Also, it was an incredible act of love, a final act of love to take care of her the way you did at the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I think there‘s another lesson here. It’s a negative lesson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane and I had this hermetic relationship. Jane, she kept her family at a distance. There‘s all kinds of psychodynamic stuff going on there, but she had a sister and a brother and a mother that she just, long before she got sick, kept at a distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; She didn’t even tell them for a long time that she had cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;No, she forbade me to tell them. She kept my daughter at a distance. We didn’t have many friends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I can’t speak for her, but from my experience, her last year would’ve been very different if I had family support. So there‘s another negative lesson, don’t try to do this by yourself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; That was one of the things that is so memorable from my cancer journey. Once I told other people and family that I had cancer, I had this incredible outpouring of support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You didn’t experience that during the time Jane had cancer. But, I had meals, I had the newsroom put up a collection meal train. People came over and babysat my kids for me. My mom flew in from California and took care of me and did the laundry and helped me change my dressings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;That’s so great. So that’s the way it should be, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, that’s the way it should be. Now when I know other people have cancer, I pay it forward. I pay it back. I then provide the meals and support. It’s actually this incredible experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You feel incredibly human and alive. It’s amazing. I feel bad you didn’t get to experience that because if there‘s a silver lining to cancer, it’s to see humanity come out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I totally agree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Once you can blow past the patronizing stuff we talked about earlier, what you get is really authentic and caring support. It is this sort of silver lining. If you have to go through this, and you know we are all doomed to go through something, there‘s that aspect of it that you can look for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; What do you want people to take away from reading your memoir about Jane‘s story? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Well first, I don’t want them to be so mad at me. That’s selfish, I know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; I’m not mad at you anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Okay. Okay. No, I think there are a couple things. One is that people are infinitely diverse. Everybody’s different. Everybody’s response to what may seem like a common disease is going to be different. We as physicians and also as family members, I hate to use this phrase, have to sort of meet people where they are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think Jane is an extreme example of this. If I had been more skillful, I might have been able to let her have the autonomy she was seeking, but in a way that didn’t make her life worse. So I think that’s one lesson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another lesson is that we are capable of helping. Don’t believe that you’re not strong enough to take on something that seems to be horrific. I couldn’t have had a nightmare worse than what I had seen when Jane finally collapsed. Yet, we got through that. We had a final year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think those are the main things. And then the last thing is we should also be thinking about those who have survived the deaths of the people they loved. Those survivors have been touched very deeply. They’re not the same people they were before this happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This was really one of the reasons that I ended up publishing this book at all. I felt very guilty about revealing Jane‘s secret. I talked to Jane‘s sister, who as it turns out, is an author, and I gave her a copy of the book. She said she was mad at me, but then she said she liked it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “Well, can I publish this? It just doesn’t seem right to be able to do this.” And what she said I think was really important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said, “For a long time, this was Jane‘s story. But now it’s your story and you can do whatever you want with your story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Barrett Rollins is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a longtime cancer researcher. His book is called “In Sickness: A Memoir.” He also has a new book called “First the Patient,” about another fascinating medical story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Listen to more “Say More” episodes at&lt;a href="http://globe.com/saymore" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; globe.com/saymore&lt;/a&gt; and wherever you get your podcasts.

These peri-LC neurons modulate the locus coeruleus by releasing GABA, which reduces its activity and dampens the release of norepinephrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system allows the brain to respond differently to various challenges, such as suppressing pain while heightening motor activity in emergencies. Researchers used advanced techniques to map and profile these neurons, uncovering distinct subtypes in both regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peri-LC Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Peri-LC neurons regulate arousal by inhibiting locus coeruleus activity using GABA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Modulation:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain tailors its response to threats by fine-tuning different systems—like enhancing movement while suppressing pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this circuit may help treat anxiety, PTSD, and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small cluster of cells deep within our brains, called the locus coeruleus, affects how awake and attentive we are, how we respond to stress, how we cope with anxiety and fear, and how we create memories and learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus, Latin for “blue spot,” is also involved in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer’s diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109967"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Scientists have inferred that the locus coeruleus must play a nuanced role.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its importance, relatively little is known how the locus coeruleus works. It is known to receive inputs from throughout the central nervous system and to send signals, in the form of the chemical norepinephrine, across the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not been clear, however, how it processes the information it receives, nor how that affects how much norepinephrine it releases, and where. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a new study in mice shows that a small group of cells next to the locus coeruleus, called peri-LC neurons, appear to play a key role in regulating its information-processing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings help explain how we respond appropriately to different challenges, according to Andrew Luskin, a postdoctoral associate in the Laboratory of Neural Dynamics &amp;amp; Cognition at Rockefeller University in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luskin, who conducted the research while he was a graduate student at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is the co-first author of the study with Dr. Li Li, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the UW School of Medicine and a principal investigator at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Traditionally, the peri-LC has been thought of as sort of a ‘dimmer switch’ for the brain’s level of arousal,” Luskin said, “which globally affects locus coeruleus firing — from a lot, when you’re extremely anxious, to a little, when you’re asleep, and somewhere in the middle when you’re alert but relaxed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have inferred that the locus coeruleus must play a nuanced role.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your toddler runs out into the street, you want your motor system tuned up so you can chase after them,” Luskin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you also want your pain system tuned down, so if you stub your toe as you run, you’ll ignore the pain and focus on catching the child. It is possible that these responses are being fine-tuned by the peri-LC.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers observed how neurons in the peri-LC responded when the mice were exposed to different stimuli that increase arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found these stimuli tended to cause the peri-LC to release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. To varying degrees, this decreased the firing of locus coeruleus neurons and reduced their release of norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The peri-LC cells apparently act like a radio gain circuit that can dial up or down the strength of the locus coeruleus cells’ response to incoming signals,” said senior author Michael Bruchas, professor of anesthesiology &amp;amp; pain medicine, pharmacology and bioengineering. He is an investigator at the UW School of Medicine’s Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction, Pain and Emotion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the anatomy of the peri-LC and detailed how various groups of its neurons affect the neuronal activity of the locus coeruleus differently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that, like the locus coeruleus, the peri-LC neurons receive inputs from major centers of the brain and spinal cord but transmit signals almost exclusively to the locus coeruleus. These signals inhibit locus coeruleus neuron firing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the different types of neurons in the locus coeruleus and peri-LC, and another technique called pixel-seq to map their exact locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investigations revealed that both the locus coeruleus and peri-LC have distinct subpopulations of cells, likely with different functions.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides advancing understanding of how our brains regulate arousal, attention and our response to stress and fear, the findings open the possibility of new ways to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, said Li, who studies opioid drug withdrawal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During withdrawal, for example, we know the locus coeruleus becomes hyperactive,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these findings we may be able to identify drug targets either in the locus coeruleus or the peri-LC that will reduce withdrawal symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper provides researchers with what Bruchas described as a “detailed roadmap” for studying the locus coeruleus and peri-LC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding shows us who the key players are, how they connect, and the neurotransmitters involved,” he said. “It will open a lot of doors for a lot of labs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec808985808d8bac999bc2898899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leila Gray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uw.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leila Gray – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08952-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heterogeneous pericoerulear neurons tune arousal and exploratory behaviours&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrew Luskin et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heterogeneous pericoerulear neurons tune arousal and exploratory behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the primary source of noradrenaline in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) regulates arousal, avoidance and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, how local neuromodulatory inputs control LC function remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we identify a population of transcriptionally, spatially and functionally diverse GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the LC dendritic field that receive distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control global arousal levels and arousal-related processing and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC noradrenaline-producing and peri-LC cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identify several neuronal cell types that underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary neural circuit approaches in behaving mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons are transcriptionally, functionally and anatomically heterogenous neuronal populations that modulate arousal and avoidance states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity of the LC and peri-LC provides a roadmap for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal, motivation and neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2,000 dementia-free adults and found that long sleep duration was associated with worse performance in memory, visuospatial ability, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were significantly stronger in people with depression, regardless of whether they were on antidepressants.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They derived the results from an examination of sleep duration and cognition in 1,853 dementia-and-stroke-free participants in the Framingham Heart Study, which is an ongoing community-based cohort study of residents in Framingham, Massachusetts, under the direction of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. This latest examination focused on those ages 27 to 85 with a mean age of 49.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, long-sleepers were more likely to report symptoms of depression,” said Vanessa Young, MS, clinical research project manager at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep may be a modifiable risk for cognitive decline in people with depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young, who also is with the Translational Science PhD program in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at UT Health San Antonio, is first author of the study titled, “Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study,” published April 21 in&lt;em&gt; Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors also represent Arizona State University; the Framingham Heart Study; Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal; University of Montreal; Boston University; and Monash University, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long but not short sleep duration was associated with poorer global cognition and specific cognitive abilities like memory, visuospatial skills and executive functions,” said Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute and senior author of the study. “These associations were stronger in people with depressive symptoms, regardless of antidepressant usage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, there is increasing recognition of the significance of sleep as a vital physiological process for brain health. Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns have been observed across lifespans and are present in both normal and pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disturbances contribute to an increased risk of cognitive deficits and Alzheimer’s disease. The Global Council on Brain Health recommends 7 to 8 hours of nightly sleep for adults to preserve brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that both excessive and insufficient sleep relative to the prescribed duration are linked to impairments in cognitive domains, including memory, attention and the ability to manage and direct other mental processes, such as planning, problem-solving and controlling impulses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, evidence has been marked by inconsistencies depending on the lifespan being examined, and on health differences such as depression. Depression, a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, often co-occurs with sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between sleep disorders and depression is well established, with about 90% of people with depression reporting problems with sleep, the study notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, the scientists investigated whether depression modified the associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framingham participants were categorized into four groups: no depressive symptoms, no antidepressants; depressive symptoms without antidepressant use; antidepressant use without depressive symptoms; and depressive symptoms and antidepressant use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that long sleep was associated with reduced overall cognitive function, with the strongest effects in those with depressive symptoms using and not using antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaker but significant effects were observed in those without depressive symptoms. No significant associations were observed in participants using antidepressants without depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, they concluded that associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance are strongest in individuals with depressive symptoms, regardless of antidepressant use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future longitudinal studies including large-scale, multi-modal approaches are needed to further elucidate the temporal relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive changes,” the researchers said in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68a838395d4d4a693928e95859587c8838293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Lee – UT San Antonio&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Vanessa Young et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70160-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether depression modified the associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70160-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined the associations between sleep duration and cognition in 1853 dementia-and-stroke-free participants (mean age 49.8 years, [range 27–85]; 42.7% male).

Even after adjusting for genetic risk, health conditions, and lifestyle factors, lonely individuals had a 24% higher chance of developing hearing loss, especially sensorineural types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that stress-related physiological changes may help explain the connection. Notably, this association was stronger in women and remained consistent across multiple analytical models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness increases hearing loss risk by 24%, regardless of genetic predisposition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensorineural Emphasis:&lt;/strong&gt; The effect is strongest for sensorineural hearing loss, linked to inner ear or nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; The association was notably stronger in women than men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large-scale cohort study led by researchers from Tianjin University, Shenyang Medical College, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong has uncovered strong evidence that loneliness may independently increase the risk of hearing loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt; on May 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109951"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman sitting alone." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The association was especially pronounced for sensorineural hearing loss, a form linked to cochlear or neural damage, and was stronger in women than men. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent global health conditions, affecting more than 1.5 billion people. While physiological and behavioral risk factors are well-documented, the role of psychosocial factors such as loneliness has been underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sought to determine whether loneliness is not just a consequence but also a contributing factor to hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from 490,865 participants in the UK Biobank, the researchers tracked individuals over a median period of 12.3 years. Loneliness was measured at baseline through a single-item self-report, and incident hearing loss was identified via electronic health records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that lonely individuals had a 24% higher risk of developing hearing loss compared to their non-lonely counterparts, even after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, comorbidities, ototoxic drug use, social isolation, depression, and genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of developing hearing loss, independent of other well-known risk factors,” said Yunlong Song, from the Institute of Applied Psychology at Tianjin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a potentially harmful feedback loop in which loneliness and hearing loss exacerbate one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was especially pronounced for sensorineural hearing loss, a form linked to cochlear or neural damage, and was stronger in women than men. Interestingly, while genetic predisposition to hearing loss also increased overall risk, it did not modify the effect of loneliness, indicating loneliness acts through distinct pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose multiple mechanisms to explain this relationship, including loneliness-related inflammation, elevated blood pressure, neuroendocrine stress responses, and associated chronic diseases and unhealthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings remained robust across sensitivity analyses, including models excluding early cases and incorporating self-reported hearing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to investigate the behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms that might explain how loneliness contributes to hearing loss,” said co-author Bin Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we aim to conduct intervention studies to test whether alleviating loneliness can lower the risk of hearing loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this loneliness and hearing loss research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f9e1eee7f9f5c0e2eaedf5aee5e4f5aee3ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yu Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjmu.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yu Yang – Health Data Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.34133/hds.0281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Loneliness and Risk of Incident Hearing Loss: The UK Biobank Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Yunlong Song et al. &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness and Risk of Incident Hearing Loss: The UK Biobank Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Hearing loss (HL) is one major cause of disability and can lead to social impairments. However, the relationship between loneliness and the risk of incident HL remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate this association among adults in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; This cohort study was based on data from the UK Biobank study. Loneliness was assessed by asking participants if they often felt lonely. Incident HL was defined as a primary diagnosis, ascertained via linkage to electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between loneliness and risk of incident HL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Our analyses included 490,865 participants [mean (SD) age, 56.5 (8.1) years; 54.4% female], among whom 90,893 (18.5%) reported feeling lonely at baseline. Over a median follow-up period of 12.3 years (interquartile range, 11.3 to 13.1), 11,596 participants were diagnosed with incident HL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to non-lonely participants, lonely individuals exhibited an increased risk of HL [hazard ratio (HR), 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30 to 1.43]. This association remained (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.31) after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, biological and lifestyle factors, social isolation, depression, chronic diseases, use of ototoxic drugs, and genetic risk of HL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint analysis showed that loneliness was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident HL across all levels of genetic risks for HL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness was associated with the risk of incident HL independent of other prominent risk factors. Social enhancement strategies aimed at alleviating loneliness may prove beneficial in HL prevention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:58:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBvRnFfaXctZjJEOHg3TVd2LVhWVnJQT2w3RnFUQkdIWXM0SXFhUmpGM0YxeFFCdWNiNXIxTFFJZS11UklFa1hSQ1gxNDVHeVpJQ1Zzckw0dUJUQnFKS19rbk1yODc2SzJRekE00gFwQVVfeXFMT3BJRmtMcVVlR1pXME9XMnplaUNEMXdRZkowTGQyN3kxU2FnS2MyMmV2VEVvSEttbEhVVTRfbTF3ZDFqUFdlS3pmWWhaeHk5X19XSlphVXdpZ0ZWNzFyY29pVEplT0FDSWJQNzVpdDBEdw</guid></item><item><title>32岁的超级健康男子在服用流行药物后濒临死亡-专家警告更多健身房游客可能会b -每日邮报 | Ultra-fit man, 32, on the brink of death after taking popular medication - experts warn more gym-goers could b - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPY0V2WG5rZG9UaG1TcUVFdmZGODU1czVwUUlDbjY0Q2FCRDlrSUt6d1c5UTV5ZXBvUUtFUVJIT0tsOG85eS1hZXJLV1pFNWExR0tHeFhiTmdkbERjbGFncGxOenpCbDc1YjBzV1FfSXhLMkJSdEJEdDV1MjVwU1BsSjZBTE1pUlI2M2JDMmxfTmYydDlyeHZHU3JvNjNveUtGOE5ZVWZLb9IBrAFBVV95cUxONXlFd0VWYnRzc3R0a29wbjJiOXNXMU15R1FDSlF5M1FFS3JaR3ljN1Z2T3pLeWQtQlVnR3EwUDdZQWdQY051eTIya1QtWDZSdW9mdktvWUQ2Ym9ZaVVvMVFSVkEzb1c0ZXZzOUNvbzh0OEg2M1hrOVVnYXJWaHl3TGozTG9XeDZIOHg4TFZuMDloa1JiakdvQVY2RGVJOE1HN2dCaGdDU3ZVemJJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bodybuilder was left fighting for his life after abusing a drug which experts warn more young men are turning to, unaware of its devastating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zak Wilkinson, 32, spent more than two years using steroids, splashing £35,000 on the performance enhancing drugs, injecting himself up to three times daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The avid gym goer, like a growing number of young men, turned to anabolic steroids, a type of image and performance drug taken, to increase his muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs mimic testosterone – one of the hormones responsible for boosting muscle mass – but can have devastating side effects, including an increased risk of suffering a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts warn there has been a concerning rise in their use fuelled by social media triggering body image issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Wilkinson hopes to do his part in raising the alarm about the potentially life changing effects of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On March 23 2022, the father of one's gruelling steroid regime finally caught up with him when he started having seizures, vomiting and sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Wilkinson was placed in a medically induced coma after suffering the side effects of years of steroid use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The father of one said he had been using the drugs since the age of 16 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was rushed to intensive care unit at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, after his sister, Chelsea Wilkinson, 37, called an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors thought he could be suffering from meningitis, but quickly realised the fits were caused by his steroid use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said Mr Wilkinson was fortunate to avoid suffering long term neurological damage after being left non-verbal for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was put into a medically-induced coma for a week, with his medical team saying it was a 'miracle' he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson, a scaffolder, said: 'I thought I'd never be able to play with my son again, that I'd never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After the coma had ended, one doctor said that he couldn't believe I was speaking with him because he thought I'd have brain complications for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was so frightened that that could be the end of me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson said steroids had 'just got hold of him' and warned that gym goers need to be aware of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The bodybuilder says his body dysmorphia led to him turning to the drugs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was an all or nothing approach - it's frightening. It just gets hold of you. I thought I was the fittest, strongest, healthiest person, but on the inside I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's sad because I see a lot of young lads becoming affected by it. And that's why a lot of the bodybuilders are dying prematurely, because it's not healthy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have warned Mr Wilkinson that he will likely have medical issues for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has a meeting with his treatment team twice a week, and also has to take anxiety, sleeping, and epilepsy medication, as well as attend frequent appointments for brain scans and blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It could still all affect me later on, and I'm probably going to be on constant medication for the rest of my life,' says Mr Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have PTSD, body dysmorphia, a diagnosed eating disorder, regular flashbacks, and I'm having rehabilitation for trauma. I've also now become epileptic due to the coma.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids are the most common type of 'image and performance enhancing drug'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are typically injected directly into the muscle, though can also be taken orally in tablet form or even as a cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have said that he will likely suffer lifelong health implications from steroid use &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids work by mimicking the effects of the male sex hormone testosterone, tricking the body into producing more muscular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this comes at a cost. Common side effects include: severe acne, kidney failure, high cholesterol and even stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark study published last year by Danish researchers found steroid users have an &lt;span&gt;almost 300 per cent increased risk of death within two decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor, an expert in anatomy at Lancaster University said: ‘The growth in people self prescribing steroids for performance reasons is of real concern.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a danger of suffering serious side effects if you are using these drugs, from heart attacks, and brain damage to long term mobility issues.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cases like this show the danger of anabolic steroids, and people need to be aware of the consequences when they see people promoting the drugs on their social media feeds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson said he started taking steroids at 16 after struggling with body dysmorphia - a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about perceived flaws in their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The drugs were very accessible and I was weighing everything - even down to the sugar-free syrups in my coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It started as a hobby and then it became body dysmorphia. I could barely look in the mirror, and I would put jumpers and hoodies on to avoid showing my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And that explains the tattoos. I'm so body conscious. I've tried every diet out there, I've tried protein diet, meat and eggs diet, weight loss diets, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's because social media creates competition and you're constantly comparing yourself to others and looking at others trying to emulate them. It's a vicious circle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that steroid use is on the rise in young men fuelled by social media. Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The steroids were selfish, I didn't care about my son or my friends or my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it happens ever so slowly, you start taking steroids, and the benefits you see on the outside make you want to take more, but it isolates you from your friendships and bonds with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to socialise and spend time with my partner. I was just striving for perfection in the bodybuilding game when everything around me was falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My family nearly lost someone who was important in their lives - it was a tough time for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a real taboo around men and steroid use. There's AA for alcoholics, GA for gamblers, but not really a lot on steroid use and the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to show people who are struggling what I've been through, that these muscles are not worth the comas, seizures, constant brain scans, tubes out your mouth, possibly losing a member of your family - all because you want to look good and compare yourself on social media.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the researchers noted a “statistically significant reduction” in assessment scores across all measures of these common &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms of MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Ellagic acid] appears to significantly alleviate fatigue, depression, and anxiety in MS patients,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, an &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1238846/full"&gt;earlier analysis&lt;/a&gt; of this same triple-blind study showed that ellagic acid may reduce the levels of molecules that signal inflammation in MS, while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory molecules. This would be expected to ease symptoms and slow progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20552173251331524"&gt;Ellagic acid favorable effects on fatigue, depression and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis and moderate disability: A randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Journal — Experimental, Translational and Clinical&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Investigating ellagic acid supplements for use in MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin&lt;/a&gt;, a protective covering that surrounds nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These inflammatory attacks cause a gradual buildup of damage, leading to worsening disability that typically affects a patient’s ability to function in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mobility-related symptoms, such as stiffness and problems with balance and walking, are the most common, people with MS also can experience other issues — often fatigue and mental health problems. Such symptoms can be bothersome and take a toll on a patient’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In humans, the effects of … the demyelination process … in MS patients are known to cause the onset of psychological consequences of the disease, including depression, anxiety and fatigue,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many individuals with MS consider holistic management strategies that combine a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-and-exercise/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/01/12/expert-voices-complementary-alternative-medicine-ms/"&gt;complementary treatments&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the use of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;approved medication&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2021/12/30/vitamin-d-supplements-may-improve-ms-quality-life/"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; that’s sometimes considered is vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the team of researchers sought to learn more about the effects of ellagic acid, or EA, supplements. Ellagic acid is found in certain fruits and seeds, like raspberries, strawberries, red grapes, pomegranates, almonds, and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the basis of animal models and laboratory studies, EA has been identified as an effective substance for treating chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies in mouse models of MS showed that ellagic acid may help reduce inflammation and ease symptoms of the disease. However, no studies have examined the effects of ellagic acid supplements in people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the team recruited 58 adults, ages 18 to 55, who had been &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with MS&lt;/a&gt; for at least six months. Their scores on the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-prognosis-life-expectancy/#MS_Progression"&gt;Expanded Disability Status Scale&lt;/a&gt; (EDSS), a commonly used measure, ranged from 4.5 to 5.5 points, indicating significant disability with minor limitations in daily activities to disability severe enough to prevent some daily activities from being done independently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Disability levels seen to decrease significantly with one dose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were randomly assigned to receive either ellagic acid — two capsules taken with meals, totaling 180 mg daily — or a placebo, while maintaining their usual diet and physical activity patterns. The researchers called or texted participants to help them stick to the schedule. At the end of the study, leftover capsules were counted to determine compliance with the treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three months, the EDSS scores of patients on ellagic acid had decreased significantly, by an average of 1.01 points, indicating a lower disability level. For those on the placebo, there was no significant change in their EDSS score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;We found a statistically significant reduction in [assessment] scores compared to the control group. … The changes achieved are also clinically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, patients on ellagic acid showed a significant reduction in anxiety, depression, and fatigue after three months, while these symptoms remained virtually unchanged in the placebo group. Similar results were observed for physical, psychosocial, and cognitive fatigue scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a statistically significant reduction in [assessment] scores compared to the control group,” the researchers wrote, adding that “the changes achieved are also clinically significant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that their study “is the first to investigate the effects of EA … on psychological impairments such as anxiety, fatigue and depression in MS patients.” As a study limitation, however, team noted that only a single dose of the supplement was given. Further, the trial was very small in size. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although additional investigations are needed to determine how to [ease] psychological symptoms in MS patients, mechanisms such as the anti-inflammatory properties of [ellagic acid] can be considered,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:12:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOY0QxbTc4cGlWVlhVLV9FZmgwdjllR2phSlNJVUo2c0hWM2dqY29xTkgzZTZCNW9NMGdGa2ktSTdHcHhpaXJwR2JKdU9WNncyZDVWbUVpczJ6dXRHZ0lydk1XczJTYzFoSlpEOEtFaE12QTFVX3I4TEFNN0txZjNMNlJpV3dNUmRTdDJPdGdsNmJFc2dNRG9EeFJCMmJtbHplVS0wRl9QeWZQZ2pSMjlPNHZvWmRsVkFNb09pSg</guid></item><item><title>即使您锻炼身体，每天坐上几个小时也会缩小您的大脑- Earth.com | Sitting for hours daily shrinks your brain, even if you exercise - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQVDRIY0ZQellWb3RkXzZ3NTJRd2FpT2VRcVU2WkluYXNfVmlUTjgzczR3MG5qMDQxSGtyY25fQXF3OFlWcGsyOGFFeG5jNF82RHJ6TC01cDJ5cHF2VWtaNjdtbmlqNUZVR3Z2Zy1TR3JqcXc0QlZYcjZOUGgxS0s4V1owZDdMTG9Nd3hZSkFrbnhDRUJzOHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine spending hours on the couch, feeling good about the morning’s workout. You ran, you lifted, you stretched. You believe you’ve done enough to protect your health. But new research says that may not be true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for extended periods, regardless of exercise, can harm the brain. Even the most active older adults face the risk of faster brain shrinkage if they sit too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, tracked older adults for seven years. They examined how long participants sat, how often they moved, and how much their brains shrank over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were troubling. Exercise didn’t fully counteract the effects of prolonged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sedentary-behavior-sitting-for-hours-health-risk-early-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt;. The more hours spent sitting, the greater the brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-for-hours-shrinks-the-brain"&gt;Sitting for hours shrinks the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that even those who exercised for 150 minutes a week still experienced brain shrinkage if they sat for long hours. Memory declined, and the hippocampus lost volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore wrist monitors that tracked every move. On average, they sat for 13 hours a day. That’s a lot of time spent sitting – at the desk, on the couch, in the car. And it took a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who sat more had thinner brains in areas linked to memory and Alzheimer’s disease. Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt; time might help protect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-risk-and-sitting"&gt;Genetic risk and sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-raise-blood-pressure-even-in-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sitting&lt;/a&gt; is bad enough. But for those carrying the APOE-ε4 gene, it’s worse. This gene already raises the risk of Alzheimer’s. The researchers found that it also amplifies the impact of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who carry the APOE-ε4 gene lost more gray matter in specific parts of the brain. These areas include the frontal and parietal lobes, which are important for making decisions and remembering information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these brain regions became smaller, APOE-ε4 carriers had more trouble with memory tasks. They couldn’t remember words as easily as others. They also found it harder to name objects quickly. The damage in these brain areas made simple memory tasks more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sitting-hurts-the-brain"&gt;Why sitting hurts the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you sit for a long time, blood flow to the brain slows down. This means the brain gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients, which are essential for keeping brain cells healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less blood flow, the brain struggles to maintain strong connections between its cells. Over time, this can cause the hippocampus – the part of the brain that manages memory – to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sitting&lt;/a&gt; can also lead to more inflammation in the body. Inflammation involves chemicals that can harm brain cells. For people with the APOE-ε4 gene, which is linked to Alzheimer’s, this inflammation could cause even more damage to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-brain-decline"&gt;Sitting and brain decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t just look at brain volume once. It tracked changes over seven years. The findings were clear. More sitting meant faster brain shrinkage, especially in those with genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants sat for an average of 13 hours a day. Even those who exercised regularly couldn’t escape the damage. They still lost brain volume in areas tied to memory, language, and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-can-t-erase-the-damage"&gt;Exercise can’t erase the damage &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t undo hours of sitting with a morning run – the study made that clear. Exercise helps, but it doesn’t erase the damage from hours of inactivity. Movement throughout the day matters more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest breaking up sitting time with frequent walks, stretches, or standing breaks. Stand during phone calls. Walk around while reading emails. The brain needs regular movement to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-brain-size-and-health"&gt;Sitting, brain size, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used wrist monitors to measure real movement – not self-reported activity. Participants wore them for seven days, 24 hours a day. The data was precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans provided another layer of insight. The experts measured cortical thickness in regions linked to Alzheimer’s. They tracked changes in brain volume over time, focusing on the hippocampus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-loss-and-language-decline"&gt;Memory loss and language decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings weren’t just about brain volume. They were about memory too. Those who sat more performed worse on naming tasks. They couldn’t recall names or objects as quickly. They struggled to remember words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For APOE-ε4 carriers, the decline was steeper. As discussed above, they lost brain volume faster and showed more severe memory loss. The researchers believe sitting speeds up age-related brain changes in those already at genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-less-protects-the-brain"&gt;Sitting less protects the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for long hours can damage the brain, especially in older adults. Even if you exercise, the harm from sitting too much doesn’t go away. You need to keep moving throughout the day to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people sit for around nine hours a day. In the study, people sat for 13 hours daily. Cutting down on sitting time can help prevent brain damage. Every step you take could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:07:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQVDRIY0ZQellWb3RkXzZ3NTJRd2FpT2VRcVU2WkluYXNfVmlUTjgzczR3MG5qMDQxSGtyY25fQXF3OFlWcGsyOGFFeG5jNF82RHJ6TC01cDJ5cHF2VWtaNjdtbmlqNUZVR3Z2Zy1TR3JqcXc0QlZYcjZOUGgxS0s4V1owZDdMTG9Nd3hZSkFrbnhDRUJzOHc</guid></item><item><title>大脑通过推理学会恐惧，而不仅仅是经验-神经科学新闻 | The Brain Learns to Fear Through Inference, Not Just Experience - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE53NmlKdzlNaWszNGNwMXItNzJIcDZJQ2w4VnhPQkJwcnZCRjZOaDd2SFBmZEsyazAxYXB3NDJ1TVFOcGo2ZEFjUWJiM0dnTDFvZmFWclowcEVWMFlSajZaTW9sUWl1cEViZ3ZQMDJKVXg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals how rats can learn to fear through inference, offering insights into the neural basis of higher-order emotions. By pairing a neutral sound and image, then associating the image with an unpleasant experience, researchers showed that rats later feared the sound alone—demonstrating inferred emotional learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) played a key role in this process by tagging neurons during sensory pairing and activating them during emotional learning. Blocking mPFC activity disrupted this inference, while direct memory associations remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-Order Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats can infer fear from indirect associations, not just direct experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mPFC Role:&lt;/strong&gt; The medial prefrontal cortex enables inference by linking neutral stimuli to aversive outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help unravel mechanisms behind human anxiety and trauma-related disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RIKEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaowei Gu and Joshua Johansen at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan have discovered key circuitry in the rat brain that allows the learning of inferred emotions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals how the frontal part of the brain coordinates with the amygdala—a brain region important for simple forms of emotional learning—to make this higher-order emotional ability possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109938"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Blocking the output from the mPFC to the amygdala during the test phase also prevented rats from responding to the noise with fear. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on May 14, this breakthrough study is the first to show how the brain codes human-like internal models of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are inferred emotions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a child who often watches a wasp fly in and out of its nest in the woods near her house. One day the child is stung by the wasp for the first time, a frightening experience that changes her emotional response to this creature but also to the nest itself. Afterward, seeing the wasp’s nest alone makes the child feel anxious and become alert and cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the child has built an internal model that links the negative experience with the visual representation of the nest – even though the nest was not there at the time of the fearful event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johansen and Gu were interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that allow this type of higher-order emotional processing through inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, they created a similar situation in animals; rats learned a neutral association between a noise and an image, then later experienced unpleasantness while seeing the image—a process called aversive conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were tested to see if they could infer from hearing the noise alone that something unpleasant might happen. Under these conditions, rats did indeed freeze when they heard the noise, indicating their fear and showing that they too can learn inferred emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they had a successful animal model, the researchers used a combination of calcium imaging and optogenetics to examine changes in neuron activity within a part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As hypothesized, experiments indicated that the mPFC is the basis of emotional inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before undergoing aversive conditioning, neurons in the mPFC responded similarly to both the image and the noise, whether the stimuli had been paired or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after aversive learning, calcium imaging showed that the number of noise-responsive and noise/image co-responsive neurons went way up— provided the noise and image had been initially paired together when presented to the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing showed that this phenomenon was possible because the initial sensory pairing “tagged” co-responsive neurons, making them primed to activate during aversive conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetically blocking the mPFC during the aversive learning stage prevented rats from being able to make the later inference. In this case because the image and the unpleasant experience, and indirectly the noise, could not properly become linked in the rats’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the output from the mPFC to the amygdala during the test phase also prevented rats from responding to the noise with fear. However, in this case it was because they could not properly recall the inferred memory, even though the association had been made the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rats had no problem freezing in response to the image, indicating that only the higher-order ability of inference is rooted in the physical changes that take place in mPFC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Johansen explains, “decades of studying aversive learning in rodents has revealed that the amygdala is a critical site for storing simple emotional memories involving directly experienced associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our new findings indicate that the mPFC is a central brain region for higher order human-like emotions, which involve internal models and inference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The value of our study,” says Johansen, “is that it opens the door for researchers everywhere to examine the neural mechanisms that mediate higher order emotions, which are more relevant to human psychiatric conditions like anxiety or trauma-related disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this fear and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b9bcb9b5f6a8b0b1b4b4b1a8ab98aab1b3bdb6f6b2a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adam Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://riken.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RIKEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam Phillips – RIKEN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09001-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Johansen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related sensory patterns that were not part of the original experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of learning requires internal models of emotion, which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala, whether and how the brain forms and represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations are not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representations form through a multi-step encoding mechanism involving recruitment and stabilization of dmPFC cells that support inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in the dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 12:57:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE53NmlKdzlNaWszNGNwMXItNzJIcDZJQ2w4VnhPQkJwcnZCRjZOaDd2SFBmZEsyazAxYXB3NDJ1TVFOcGo2ZEFjUWJiM0dnTDFvZmFWclowcEVWMFlSajZaTW9sUWl1cEViZ3ZQMDJKVXg</guid></item><item><title>一直都累吗？你可能患有鲜为人知的营养不足，警告专家-每日邮报 | Tired all the time?

However, animal sources tend to have much more, she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent YouGov study found that one in eight people in the UK report feeling tired ‘all the time’ and a quarter of us are tired ‘most of the time’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There’s even a medical acronym for it: TATT or ‘tired all the time’. While it is estimated more than 400,000 people in the UK suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include waking up exhausted despite sleeping well, headaches, mood swings and lack of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common causes can include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, diabetes and hypothyroidism, which is when the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones leading to slow metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common cause may also be depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can lead to severe, short-term failure of the heart muscle and can be fatal. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be misdiagnosed as a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is one of the largest to assess in-hospital death rates and complications of the condition, as well as differences by sex, age and race over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that the death rate from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated,” said study author M. Reza Movahed, M.D., Ph.D., an interventional cardiologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed health records in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to identify people diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The death rate was considered high at 6.5%, with no improvement over period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deaths were more than double in men at 11.2% compared to the rate of 5.5% among women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major complications included congestive heart failure (35.9%), atrial fibrillation (20.7%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%) and cardiac arrest (3.4%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People older than age 61 had the highest incidence rates of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, there was a 2.6 to 3.25 times higher incidence of this condition among adults ages 46-60 compared to those ages 31-45 during the study period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White adults had the highest rate of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (0.16%), followed by Native American adults (0.13%) and Black adults (0.07%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, socioeconomic factors, including median household income, hospital size and health insurance status, varied significantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious condition with a substantial risk of death and severe complications,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health care team needs to carefully review coronary angiograms that show no significant coronary disease with classic appearance of left ventricular motion, suggesting any subtypes of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. These patients should be monitored for serious complications and treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that age-related findings could serve as a useful diagnostic tool in discriminating between heart attack/chest pain and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may prompt earlier diagnosis of the condition and could also remove assumptions that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy only occurs in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the study’s limitations is that it relied on data from hospital codes, which could have errors or overcount patients hospitalized more than once or transferred to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there was no information on outpatient data, different types of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or other conditions that may have contributed to patients’ deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movahed said further research is needed about the management of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the reason behind differences in death rates between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis included 199,890 U.S. adults from across the nation (average age 67; 83% of cases were among women).

The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome data of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using a large inpatient database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods and Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for our study. We evaluated trends, mortality, and complications of patients admitted with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from available years 2016 to 2020 in adults &amp;gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 199 890 patients with Takotsubo were found in our database with 83% being female and higher prevalence with age, White race, and highest income. Mortality was high at 6.5% with no significant improvement over the years studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, major complications were substantial. Cardiogenic shock occurred in 6.6%, atrial fibrillation in 20.7%, cardiac arrest in 3.4%, congestive heart failure in 35.9%, and stroke in 5.3%. Mortality was more than double in men in comparison to women (11.2% versus 5.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and complications with no improvement in outcome over the 5‐year study with higher mortality in men.

The researchers found that women with inattentive ADHD symptoms reported lower orgasmic consistency than those without ADHD symptoms or with other subtypes. These findings provide new insight into the challenges women with ADHD may face in their sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects about 2–6% of adults. It is typically characterized by patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. While ADHD has traditionally been studied more in men, there is growing recognition that women often experience different symptoms. Women are more likely to show signs of inattention, which are internal and less disruptive than hyperactivity, making them more prone to being overlooked or misdiagnosed. This difference in presentation can have far-reaching consequences, including in areas not often discussed—such as sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has consistently shown that women experience lower rates of orgasm during partnered sex than men, a phenomenon often referred to as the “orgasm gap.” Although orgasm is not required for sexual satisfaction, persistent difficulty achieving orgasm—sometimes called anorgasmia—can lead to emotional distress and reduced relationship satisfaction. Some studies have linked problems with orgasm to cognitive distraction, such as intrusive thoughts or difficulty focusing during sex. Since inattention is a hallmark of one form of ADHD, the researchers wanted to know whether this might explain why some women experience less consistent orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that furthering research and education on women’s sexual health and well-being is essential in the pursuit of equality and to support their overall health,” explained study author Tina Jensen-Fogt of Kwantlen Polytechnic University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovering that the research on sexual pleasure for women with ADHD is very limited, we were inspired to expand on this topic to better understand how ADHD symptoms may affect women’s sexual experiences during partnered sex. Our primary goals were to explore how orgasmic consistency rates vary across the three subtypes of ADHD symptomatology, and to confirm whether women with inattentive ADHD subtype symptoms reported the lowest rate of orgasmic consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, researchers conducted a large online survey involving 815 cisgender women who were sexually active with at least one partner in the past six months. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 84 and represented a wide range of backgrounds. They were recruited through social media, online forums, and a university research platform. Importantly, participants did not need a formal ADHD diagnosis to be included in the study. Instead, they completed a widely used ADHD self-report scale that allowed the researchers to categorize them based on their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed validated questionnaires that measured their orgasmic consistency during partnered sex, their level of sexual assertiveness, and their overall attitudes toward sex. This allowed the researchers to account for variables that are known to influence sexual experiences, such as the ability to communicate sexual needs or personal comfort with sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ADHD symptomatology in general was associated with slightly lower orgasmic consistency. However, this effect was small on its own. When researchers examined the data by ADHD subtype, the picture became clearer. Women with predominantly inattentive symptoms—those who reported frequent difficulty sustaining attention or being easily distracted—had the lowest rates of orgasmic consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women who experience predominantly inattentive symptoms of ADHD experienced lower rates of orgasmic consistency compared to controls and women who experienced predominantly hyperactive-impulsive or combined subtype symptoms,” Jensen-Fogt told PsyPost. “This puts women with inattentive ADHD at greater risk for the negative outcomes associated with difficulties in achieving orgasm, such as reduced sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and self-esteem, as well as to increased rates of emotional distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, women with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive symptoms actually reported higher orgasmic consistency compared to both women with predominantly inattentive symptoms and those without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One somewhat surprising finding was that participants who met the study’s criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD had greater orgasmic consistency rates than those in the control group, who did not meet the criteria for ADHD,” Jensen-Fogt said. “This suggests that the hyperactive-impulsive features of ADHD may provide some benefit to achieving orgasm, though additional research is necessary to confirm this finding and explore why this might be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how medication use influenced orgasmic consistency. Interestingly, women who did not currently meet the threshold for ADHD symptoms—but who reported taking medication typically prescribed for ADHD—had higher orgasm consistency than non-medicated women without ADHD symptoms. This suggests that medication may help manage symptoms that interfere with sexual functioning, although more research is needed to understand the role of specific medications and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor the researchers explored was sexual orientation. Among women without ADHD symptoms, those who identified as sexual minorities—such as lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual—reported higher orgasmic consistency than heterosexual women. However, this difference was not found among women with ADHD symptoms. This raises interesting questions about how sexual behavior, partner dynamics, and neurodiversity intersect to shape sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including a large and diverse sample, with participants from a range of ethnic backgrounds, education levels, and sexual orientations. The study was also pre-registered, meaning the researchers made their analysis plan public before collecting data. This improves the credibility of the findings by reducing the risk of biased or post-hoc interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations. ADHD was identified through self-reported symptoms, not clinical diagnoses, and medication details were not collected. The study focused only on partnered sex involving clitoral stimulation, excluding solo sexual activity. Importantly, the findings are correlational, meaning they show associations but cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our finding of increased orgasmic functioning among women who report using medication for ADHD symptom management need to be interpreted cautiously,” Jensen-Fogt said. “The types of medications participants used were not recorded; so while there may be some indication that medication for ADHD symptom management potentially ameliorates orgasmic difficulties, much further research is needed to examine the effects of specific types of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goals for this research include informing educational interventions for women with ADHD and for those struggling with anorgasmia. Further, we hope to engage in further research examining potential differences across other sexual functioning domains based on ADHD subtype. Our hope is to better understand what sexual difficulties are more commonly experienced by women with ADHD so that we may better support them in living sexually healthy and fulfilling lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2489771" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exploring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptomatology in Relation to Women’s Orgasmic Consistency&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tina Jensen-Fogt and &lt;a href="https://www.orgasmresearchlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cory L.

Even people who had not suffered a stroke but had plaque were living with 16 times more plastic in their arteries, &lt;a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/study-finds-50-times-higher-levels-of-micro-and-nanoplastics-in-stroke-patients-arteries" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Down to Earth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to Down to Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Clark's findings suggest that microplastics and smaller nanoplastics can find their way into our bloodstreams and plaque blockages. Since the carotid artery supplies blood to the brain, anything that gets in the way can have life-changing and potentially fatal health impacts, such as strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The full findings were presented at the American Heart Association's Vascular Discovery 2025 Scientific Sessions in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is plastic in our bodies important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The presence of microscopic bits of plastic flowing through our veins is alarming, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Karen L.

Like, maybe you tell yourself you can only eat brown rice and can never make exceptions for white rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up becoming less about healthy eating, which is usually what it starts out as, and more about an unhealthy obsession with food purity or ‘clean eating,’ or ‘proper eating,’” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It messes with your social life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it crosses the line is when it starts to interfere with your activities of daily living,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stress about food interferes with your social engagements, like you turn down plans because you aren’t sure of the food situation, it could be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it impacts your ability to live socially in the world, comfortably, then it’s a problem that you should address,” Auguste added.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up being less about the average person concerned about healthy food, and more just really obsessing about it where it’s almost your personality,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: skynesher via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;skynesher via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Orthorexia, or a preoccupation with healthy eating, is becoming more common in society.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spend lots of time analyzing ingredient lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to check the ingredient lists and nutrition labels on food from time to time, especially if you have an allergy or a specific nutrition goal you’re trying to hit. But, for someone with orthorexia, they may find that they’re “compulsively, all the time, analyzing all the ingredients,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may turn into hours and hours spent meal planning or researching the nutrition of every ingredient that’s going into your food, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you break your food rules, you feel anxious or guilty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the line comes when you start to feel like you’re thinking about [healthy eating] all the time,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like you &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/anxiety" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="have anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68220270e4b01f1185018854" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/anxiety" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;have anxiety&lt;/a&gt; ... you’re nervous about eating something ... and you feel like that more often than not, then that could be a sign that maybe you’re thinking about it too much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for if you feel guilty after breaking any of your food rules, Heise added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste added that if your thoughts about food are disrupting your mental health at all, you should consider talking to someone. Auguste also said if it interferes with your physical health, it’s absolutely a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if this sounds like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from either a dietitian or mental health professional, you can determine whether your healthy eating is simply that — or something more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to talk to somebody like a dietitian who specializes in disordered eating, a therapist who specializes in it, who can help you figure out [if this is a problem for you],” Auguste said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians generally take insurance, noted Auguste, and they can help you make sure you’re on the right track with your eating, whether or not you have specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can definitely recover from orthorexia if you have the right support,” said Heise, “so, as soon as you feel those feelings, address it as early as possible so that it doesn’t turn into something that rules your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating is a lifelong process and isn’t meant to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you eat, your nutrition needs likely differ from your partner’s, your neighbor’s and your favorite social media influencer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t put too much stock in social media nutrition trends or what diet a friend is raving about, Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over the latest food trend, focus on realistic goals — “so, not focusing on whether or not a food is clean, but focusing on whether or not you have variety in your meals,” Heise said. “Are you getting a variety of different foods? Are you getting a variety of different nutrients? Because that’s where true nutrition comes in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste said it’s important to let go of all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to eating, which includes rules around following one specific diet or a rigid plan to lose weight. “I have so many patients that do that, and then it’s not sustainable to be 100% all of the time,” Auguste added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when they fall off of the diet, they feel like a failure and give up, she noted. “I feel like that is a downside for somebody with orthorexia, is that you are afraid of letting go of the 100%, and you’re afraid that if you let go, that you fall back into that nothing,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the middle ground and remind yourself that you don’t have to be perfect, added Auguste. “You can say to yourself, ‘I usually eat healthy.’ You don’t have to say, ‘I always eat healthy,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use “always” language, you “introduce that concept of failure and judging yourself,” Auguste noted. And it’s perfectly OK, and not a failure, to have that salty snack or sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more practice you can get of letting yourself find the middle, where you’re not ‘always,’ you’re just ‘usually’ doing something, I think the better,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on all of this, have compassion for yourself. Society does not make it easy to be forgiving about food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph_drop-cap" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon0kt4000j0ihhhxoqrwry@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;In early 2021, when my boyfriend suggested I might be depressed, I thought he was overreacting, prescriptive in his high-functioning ways. This from a person who always has clean laundry and can’t sleep unless there are chia seeds soaking in the fridge for breakfast. His assessment of depression was meaningless to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19h9000m3b77zlywfxk5@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Sure, I was kind of tired and in bad mood all the time, but I chalked that up to a combination of the weather, my general personality, and having to commute to New Jersey three times a week to teach Literature 101 to college freshmen who had never read a book and didn’t intend to start now. My occasional bad moods were not a medical issue, I thought — more like the way I could never figure out how other women were physically able to wear high heels or keep their hair de-frizzed. I’m “built different.” But I do love easy, acquisition-based routes to self-improvement, so I did what any slightly crunchy-granola zillennial with a skin-care routine and four-plus hours of daily screen time might and Googled “depression supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ih000n3b77rcqpqdy2@published" data-word-count="186"&gt;I was aware of the available pharmaceutical treatments, but I was wary, nearly phobic, of psychiatric drugs. Everyone in my immediate family has been highly medicated on a cocktail of ADHD, depression, and anxiety medication for as long as I can remember. I’ve watched the agonizing process of my parents switching medication enough times to see that managing them can be as much of a job as being not depressed. For a while, my dad was on an Elvis-like cocktail of Ritalin for focus and clonazepam to take the edge off. Over the years, as his dosage of one crept up, the other rose to meet it. At their peak, my father, usually a quick-talking latter-day Groucho Marx, started speaking slowly, losing his train of thought. When he decided to taper off his behemoth dose of benzos, it took almost a year of agonizing weaning, exiled from the artificial benzo bliss and sent into an anxious state far worse than whatever the drugs were meant to mask. There’s a reason when you Google “benzo withdrawal” the first result is a large banner for the suicide-prevention hotline.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19jz000o3b77vxsp7lkb@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;To be clear, I do believe in &lt;em&gt;mental health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When I started looking for “depression supplements,” I had been in psychoanalytic therapy for about two years. She was the Platonic ideal of a therapist: an older Jewish woman who wore big wooden beads and worked from an office in the West Village. She pushed me to, as she said, “detangle a web of contradicting and harmful associations I’d made to cope with being a living person.” Also, she worked on a sliding scale and was covered by insurance. She never suggested I go on medication for depression. Actually, she didn’t think I was depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ls000p3b77bkn0mcim@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;Still, I figured the supplements could only help&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; And if they did nothing, then I’d at least enjoy the positive placebo effect of participating in &lt;em&gt;self-care&lt;/em&gt;. Like all the times I’d taken zinc to stop a cold, ingested probiotics for my “biome,” or any other tiny sugar pills found in the homeopathic aisle — I figured losing 20-ish dollars was the worst thing that might happen.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I consulted websites of varying levels of credibility, including Healthline, Goop, and the blog of RFK Jr.’s consigliere, Dr. Mark Hyman, who seems to believe that frequent trips to the sauna and a diet of nuts and berries makes you age backward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19n7000q3b770skdmv5j@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Some sites suggested classic supplements like vitamin D and fish oil. Others hawked more New Wave “adaptogens” like ashwagandha and “Reishi mushrooms,” powdered panaceas I’d seen for sale at Los Angeles crystal-and-smoothie emporiums like Moon Juice and Erewhon. My favorite skin-care–slash–woo-woo store, CAP Beauty, recommended a $2,000 “BioMat” that “uses a combination of heat and amethyst to drive far infrared rays and negative ions deep into our cells and tissues.” But man cannot persist on vibrations alone, and I was looking for something cheap and expressly &lt;em&gt;mood boosting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ol000r3b77mukudxsz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;All of the sites mentioned St. John’s wort, which was apparently amazing for “a positive mood.” None said it would cure colds, banish brain fog, or make my joints feel better. I liked that it was specifically&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a supplement helpful for aiding in the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/st-johns-wort#:~:text=What%20Have%20We%20Learned?,ADHD%2C%20and%20seasonal%20affective%20disorder"&gt;mild&lt;/a&gt; to moderate depression. My depression, if anything, was mild to moderate. I just wanted to be in a positive mood all the time. Plus I’d once taken a bath using Susanne Kaufmann’s $65 St. John’s wort bath powder and it made my skin feel slippery-smooth. So I went to Duane Reade and bought a bottle of Nature’s Way St. John’s wort supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ru000s3b77mqdjckl1@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;All recommendations for supplements, including classics like vitamin C, include a disclaimer: Speak to your doctor if you’re taking other medication. Well, I wasn’t. A website I consulted said St. John’s wort could make hormonal birth control less effective, but I had a copper IUD. Also I’d never even heard of anyone getting sick from vitamins. So I started taking the dose the bottle suggested. Three caplets, twice a day. I took those dark green pills for five months. Was I in a better mood than usual? I don’t know. Honestly, I tend to have a pretty cheery disposition except for when I have to do things that are irritating, like commuting two hours in the dark. But those five months were spread across the summer, meaning I had access to the healing powers of the sun and the Atlantic Ocean. So when my fourth bottle ran out in early November, I didn’t buy any more.&lt;/p&gt;

I got home around 4 a.m., feeling full of energy. The next morning, I woke up early and cleaned my room while listening to Ethel Merman and Barbra Streisand, singing along to “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” After, I met on Zoom with my psychoanalyst, who was spending extra time upstate for the holiday. We talked about how amazing I felt; our sessions, I said, were definitely working. Then I went down to the small grocery store on my corner to get some lunch. It was lightly snowing, and I felt buoyant in my large goose-down parka. I picked up some chicken noodle soup and a box of chocolate-covered biscuits named after a German philosopher who believed we live in the best of all possible worlds. In the checkout line, I felt a stabbing pain in my lower right abdomen, a sort of one-second period cramp. The woman at the checkout beckoned me over, and I put the soup on the counter. My vision blurred. I felt as if I were in a scene in a war movie when the sound gets cut in the middle of a battle to convey that the soldiers are overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a3g000v3b7725cluz3j@published" data-word-count="143"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aha!&lt;/em&gt; I thought, still feeling in control of everything.&lt;em&gt; I know this feeling.&lt;/em&gt; I’d fainted before, once from dehydration and basically every time I’ve smoked pot. With my vision going, I crouched down into a ball to lessen the impact to my head from the impending fall, then toppled over. A few seconds later, I woke up with five people crowded over me. I live on the Upper West Side, so there were multiple elderly women offering to call me an ambulance. I was fine, I told them, I’d only fainted. The store manager brought me a bottle of water and a small bar of some of the very bad Turkish chocolate I’d always wondered if anyone actually bought on purpose. I sat on a stool, eating the waxy chocolate, feeling better by the second as the blood came back to my head.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a4v000w3b77f3wh45zo@published" data-word-count="137"&gt;But at home, eating my soup, the pain in my lower abdomen started worrying me. Its sharpness earlier was strange, and the fact that it was now totally gone was equally unsettling. I called my doctor’s office, a large practice in Midtown East that typically schedules appointments six months in advance. They said they could fit me in the next day if it was urgent, so I decided to try to relax until then. Except instead I had a full-blown panic attack. My friend who lives nearby came over and decided the best thing to do was have me do some kind of physical exercise so I could “be more in my body.” We put on the Tracy Anderson arm-exercise video and flapped our arms like inelegant birds, a move credited with sculpting the arms of Gwyneth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a6e000x3b77jrtvra9i@published" data-word-count="184"&gt;The next day, now afraid of leaving the house by myself lest I faint again, I asked my dad to accompany me to my appointment in the Midtown East hospital district. At the doctor’s office, they said my appointment was actually one month from now. That was impossible, but they refused to believe me or let me see anybody. So my dad called his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; cardiologist, whose office happened to be upstairs, and, through the same charm, winning personality, and ability to &lt;em&gt;work the system&lt;/em&gt; that has always made him a favorite with strangers, the cardiologist eventually met us outside on the sidewalk, where he gave me an evaluation. He said that I should have gone to the emergency room after I’d fainted, but that now, since I no longer had the abdominal symptoms, there was nothing really to test. He bet it was an “ovarian torsion,” in which my ovaries twisted around each other and then quickly righted themselves, which was extremely serious, and that if it were to happen again, which he &lt;em&gt;bet it would, &lt;/em&gt;I should go straight to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a7n000y3b77c1y2x4vj@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Of course, that wasn’t the most calming thing to hear, but I white-knuckled myself into submission that evening by listening to a calming podcast by Tara Brach, the Buddhist meditation coach who said my anxious thoughts should be but waves on the ocean. “By not resisting, by letting the waves wash through us, we began to relax,” she said. The thoughts &lt;em&gt;Am I dizzy? Am I about to faint?&lt;/em&gt; flooded in nonetheless, leaving me frantic as I attempted to grade 27 undergraduate papers about what makes comedy funny.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph_drop-cap" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1adr00103b77edg2b6u5@published" data-word-count="287"&gt;The sharp pain didn’t return. But with the cardiologist’s &lt;em&gt;gentle words &lt;/em&gt;ringing in my ears, I decided to visit the CityMD on my block. The doctor there informed me that I needed to go to the hospital immediately. He said that fainting when accompanied by pain is often a “limb-threatening” illness and that I absolutely needed to be checked by an MRI machine ASAP. Somehow this information put me in a better mood than a medical emergency should have. That there might be a real medical reason for my fainting meant that it could soon come to an end. By the time I got to Mount Sinai, I felt amazing. If I fainted here, I thought cheerfully, they could probe my insides and get down to the bottom of what was going on. But after they ran myriad tests, they told me that the CityMD doctor had no idea what he was talking about. From their tone, I could tell they thought &lt;em&gt;And that’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;why he’s stuck working at CityMD&lt;/em&gt;. The doctor said the only possible emergency she’d have imagined was the small chance I had a life-threatening blood clot in my stomach. I’d have to wait four hours to get scanned. I would be kind of crazy to wait for that, the doctor told me, and if it were her, she’d go home. I felt a bit like Tony Soprano when he screams at the doctors for telling him there’s nothing medically wrong with him. But I had plans in two hours to see my friend Caroline’s concert at Terminal 5, and I was relieved to be able to leave the emergency room, where I saw a lot of people way more fucked up than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1afn00113b77jkxiu6oe@published" data-word-count="190"&gt;At Terminal 5, I was in the VIP section, right next to the speakers. My best friend, who had no idea what was happening to me, bought me a $27 tequila-soda. Everything was right as rain. At the after-party, I celebrated my internal secret victory with a few more drinks. I was outside and normal. Except the next morning, a growing sense of unease crept back in, accompanied by a brand-new ringing in my ears courtesy of the speakers, and a fear that I did, in fact, have the blood clot the doctor at the hospital had warned me about. The fear of fainting had morphed: Suddenly, I had no idea where I was. Actually, I had no idea &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;I was. I felt certain I had to escape the room, the apartment, and my body. Whipped into a frenzy, I FaceTimed my boyfriend, who was Britishly on “holiday” in “Wales” with his “school friends.” Seeing his face somehow reinforced my dissociation. He looked like a stranger, an impostor. I felt locked behind my own face, which I could see in the phone reflection was contorted into a rictus of a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1amm00123b77by1romd7@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;He could sense that something was amiss, and when he asked what was wrong, my response was a terrifying cackle. “What’s &lt;em&gt;wrong? &lt;/em&gt;How can you even ask that?” He gently recommended I go see my parents who lived only a mile away. It was getting dark outside, and various inanimate objects in the sublet apartment had started to appear menacing: the beaded curtain that blocked off the kitchen, the Calder-inspired mobile, the wall clock covered in rainbow plastic spikes. The psychiatrist I would eventually meet with, a panic specialist, explained I had been experiencing the “three D’s of panic disorder,” dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization, and for an unusually long duration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1aor00133b77zr3l3lwo@published" data-word-count="191"&gt;After I had been on the “three D’s” for five hours, crying and screaming, I took my boyfriend’s suggestion and called my parents. My mom was visiting her brother in Pennsylvania, and my dad was at dinner in midtown with his childhood friend, but he left when he heard the urgency in my voice. I lived then on the tenth floor of a prewar building with an elevator that broke at least twice a month, so my dad got stuck inside the elevator for a half-hour on the second floor. Of course, an elevator is a Faraday cage, so I experienced those 30 minutes as the complete disappearance of my dad from the Earth. When he eventually got out, he climbed eight flights of stairs with his wooden walking stick. He found me shivering and crying and was calm. Having a family history of anxiety and depression, I suppose, means that the family comes equipped with skills to manage anxiety and depression. He sat next to the bed, his thick, knobbled wooden walking stick leaving the soothing impression that he was a Gandalf-like protector. Then he gave me my first-ever Valium.&lt;/p&gt;

No, better. It’s like clean socks and a hot bowl of chili by the campfire after a long day backpacking through mud. It’s like your grandmother brushing your hair after a hot bath. I probably don’t have to explain this particular feeling of well-being, as tens of millions of Americans are legally prescribed benzos every year. Xanax cozy is our hygge&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;an American gemütlichkeit&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; In the words of Future, I was “welcome[d] to the Xanny family.”&lt;/p&gt;

This seemed to be the right kind of exception. “Hi, I’m sorry to bother you,” I wrote her, “but wanted to tell you I fainted right after our last meeting. Have been in sort of a state of nervousness and occasional panic / crying / freak out since. Went to the doctor who said nothing was wrong with me. But still feel very anxious and tired and freaked out.” We met on Zoom, where my therapist informed me she thought that through our sessions I had dissolved so many of my frameworks and coping mechanisms I’d been left destabilized and was in the process of rebuilding on steadier footing. Though I believe in Dr. Freud and his theories, I was not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1ay700173b774qe1yx7i@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;In any case, I told her, I had to return to teaching the following week and was sure that, in this state, I couldn’t make it to Newark via train. The under-construction Penn Station had become a homeless shelter guarded by military police with AK-47s, in which I was often tapped on the shoulder by some very severely mentally ill people. If I fainted there, what would happen? What if I started hysterically crying in front of my students? So my psychoanalyst referred me to a psychiatrist and said she’d have her call me that day. This psychiatrist was no Dr. Pill-pusher. Instead, she was a gentle Swedish American woman, also a boomer, with long white braids and reading glasses that hung from beaded Croakies. The Western Massachusetts–ness of her array put me immediately at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

She asked me about anything that could have triggered the panic attacks. Any major life changes? No. Any medical issues? No, aside from the new, imaginary ones. Any changes in medication? This wasn’t adding up for her, she said. She asked me to seriously think about if anything traumatic or different had happened to me. Just as we were giving up, she asked if I’d been taking any vitamins. “Oh, yes,” I said, “St. John’s wort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b0p00193b7734z5unyo@published" data-word-count="288"&gt;She sported a grave face. “Well, there’s your problem,” she said&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apparently, St. John’s wort is metabolized similarly to an SSRI like Zoloft or Lexapro. When I’d gone off of it abruptly, it was as if I’d quit a high dose of an SSRIs cold turkey. The mystery had been solved, but the misery was nowhere near over. She said that because I was taking an unregulated substance without proper studies or trials regarding cessation, it was impossible to know how long it would take to get back to normal. To feel better, she said, I would absolutely need to take a psychiatric drug. After I refused Zoloft, she decided on a course of Xanax to be taken every four hours to “hold me”; after three months, I’d wean off. One of the things I remember about those first few days, when the worst of the panic attacks had been shut down by the Xanax, but when all I could do was stare blankly at &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, was my deification of Dr. Leo Sternbach, the Polish scientist who had discovered benzodiazepine in a Roche lab in New Jersey in 1956. &lt;em&gt;Thank you, Dr. Sternbach, &lt;/em&gt;I thought as I read his Wikipedia page in the dark. &lt;em&gt;What a miracle you escaped the Nazis in 1941, what a clever doctor you were to accept a fellowship in Zurich so that you were saved and could invent medicine to save me. &lt;/em&gt;I couldn’t stop imagining what it would have been like if I’d had this psychotic break in, say, ancient Greece. Would I have been stuck like this forever? Would everyone have thought I was a seer in contact with Athena or something while really I was having a mental breakdown?&lt;/p&gt;

The triggers were always different. A single bite of chicken once sent currents of panic to my brain at a birthday dinner, leading me to hide in the bathroom of a restaurant. At a crowded weekend matinee of a Norwegian indie film, realizing it might be difficult to leave my central seat to get to the bathroom in case I had a panic attack, I ended up having a panic attack. In these cases, I would then take &lt;em&gt;still more&lt;/em&gt; Xanax, which would take about half an hour to kick in, time I usually spent in some bathroom stall sweating through my shirt like a loser kid in a teen movie.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b36001b3b77kgsdlwu7@published" data-word-count="116"&gt;Eventually, I figured out that if I just simply held the bottle of Xanax — if I just touched the bottle and felt it in my hands — I would remember that I could cancel out any panic attack that was coming. The pill bottle became talismanic, and its contents were crumbled and powdery from being shaken around like a magical maraca. After three months, under the psychiatrist’s supervision, I began to taper down my dosage by a quarter milligram every two weeks. I started the Xanax regimen in late November. Nine months later, in August, I was finally off the daily dosage, and only taking the pills “As Needed,” as it read on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

RFK Jr. and his MAHA friends peddle “Peptides” and intermittent fasting”; Trump’s nominee for surgeon general wrote a book with a chapter called “Trust Yourself, Not Your Doctor.” Still, recently, I was served some ads by a mommy-earthy fashion designer for a mushroom-adaptogen coffee. Drinking this would supposedly give me more energy and tackle “brain fog,” that eternal bogeyman. And I really considered buying some. Her life looked amazing. I told my therapist about it. She forbade me in the clearest terms from messing around with supplements and seemed genuinely bewildered by my desire to experiment further after what had happened the last time. “Don’t you already feel good?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;she asked. “And if you don’t, why don’t you want something that’ll actually work?”&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Rage, fatigue, mood swings, memory loss, hot flashes, itchy ears, inability to sleep, loss of libido, hair thinning, depression, weight gain, sore knees, night sweats, incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are all symptoms of perimenopause — or possibly just occupational hazards of midlife.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Generation X and millennials ease into their 40s and 50s, they are ready to shake off the stigma around menopause and the time leading up to it — called perimenopause — in favor of embracing treatment. An army of &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/menopause-tiktok-1.6861886" target="_blank"&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt; are pushing diet supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/21/2985347/0/en/Menopause-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-27-63-Billion-by-2033-Straits-Research.html" target="_blank"&gt;other products&lt;/a&gt; promising to help women through this phase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But how do you know if you are even in perimenopause?&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Unlike menopause — defined by the cessation of menstruation — perimenopause can be sneaky and hard to pinpoint. There's no one definitive test for it, and disentangling the symptoms from other factors can make it hard to treat. Here's how to sort out your symptoms and consider your treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Be persistent in seeking care, and consider a specialist &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Michelle Rockwell started struggling with sleep, perimenopause was not the first thing her primary care doctor suspected. " They said, 'You're too young," says Rockwell, who is now 40, and started seeking medical care a year ago. "It's easy to discount the symptoms. Doctors will say 'It's just stress or whatever,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell did not dispute that her life was stressful — she was working full time as a forensic scientist, raising a daughter, and competed in powerlifting. But she says something felt drastically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I literally had this feeling of like, I don't know who I am anymore," she says. "I was like, I don't recognize myself. I've since come to figure out that we have these levels of hormones and they affect your brain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell saw two different providers — a primary care doctor and a holistic practitioner — before she found a doctor online who specializes in menopause care. The Menopause Society provides &lt;a href="https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;this online database&lt;/a&gt; of doctors who are trained and certified in treating menopause and perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After much course correction and fine tuning with a specialist, Rockwell is now using hormone therapy, which she says has helped significantly. " I feel better now than in a long time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;General practitioners often aren't afforded the time to thoroughly evaluate their patients for perimenopause, says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director of &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Menopause Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specialists, she says, not only have more knowledge about this condition but are also not subject to the same time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Accept the uncertainty of it all &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is often thought to be a problem of a deficit of estrogen, but that is not necessarily the case, says Christmas. The transition into menopause, she explains, is characterized by fluctuations in hormones, which is why many people's experiences can be inconsistent and rocky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Perimenopause is the most tumultuous time for many people," says Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once people get through this phase and into menopause, when their ovaries aren't making any estrogen anymore, says Christmas, "many actually feel better."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moreover, she points out, it's impossible to disentangle perimenopause from the overall process of aging, which can be a time of significant physiological change. Add to that the pressures of career, family, caretaking responsibilities, financial stress — and midlife can be a roller coaster of uncertainty and stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas cautions that a certain amount of acceptance of this chaos is necessary for getting through it. She says some of her patients tell her: "The fact that you told me that these mood swings and this brain fog is real, that I'm not imagining it, that's actually enough for me.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others will go on to pursue treatment options. "Some people have very few symptoms, if any at all," says Christmas, while others "might have every possible symptom that you could think of. Most of us are somewhere in between."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Get tested for other conditions &lt;/h3&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Some clinicians suggest a strategy of first testing for a range of other conditions before considering whether perimenopause is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The 40s are a time in life when a lot of different autoimmune diseases can begin to show up," says Nanette Santoro, a gynecologist in Colorado who treats menopause. Often, she says, other conditions can have similar symptoms to perimenopause — many of them easier to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Quite often I'll do a miniature workup to make sure there's no signs of early diabetes, which happens in this age group," says Santoro. Thyroid problems, she says, can also make an appearance during this time, as can rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension and fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/16/796682276/for-some-women-nearing-menopause-depression-and-anxiety-can-spike" target="_blank"&gt;Mental health concerns&lt;/a&gt; like anxiety and depression are also worth considering as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Santoro says she's often more inclined to test for and treat these conditions than she is to measure hormone levels, which isn't necessarily that helpful. " If it's not well timed to the menstrual cycle, you may get misleading tests," she says, "and even then, you still may get misleading tests because they vary from month to month."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Understand treatment options &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy to treat especially troubling symptoms like severe hot flashes and crippling mood swings has been a subject of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;much debate&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades. While many providers who treat menopause say it can be helpful or even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;life changing&lt;/a&gt; for some patients, many stress that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I would love to be able to say that hormone therapy reduces cardiovascular risk or cognitive decline later on in life," says the Menopause Society's Christmas, "or all the miraculous anti-aging properties that people are claiming."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests hormone therapy could have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754617/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term benefits&lt;/a&gt;, she says, but research is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484309/" target="_blank"&gt;not definitive&lt;/a&gt; enough to recommend it for all women in perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2002, the &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt; study halted hormone therapy among its participants due to concerns about increased cancer risk and stroke. But since then, scientists have reassessed the data and new types of hormone therapy have become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, many experts now say past concerns about these elevated risks &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;were overblown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, says Christmas " it's a low risk, but it's not zero." Clinicians warn that people need to take into account things like family history and other factors for cancer when considering hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy also does not work for everyone.  "I have patients who try hormones for a couple of months and come back and say — we're doing something else," says gynecologist Santoro. Some patients, she says, complain of weight gain, breast tenderness or "all kinds of annoying PMS symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy may be especially beneficial for those who reach perimenopause earlier in life. "It has been helping tremendously," said Krista Russell-Adams, who hit perimenopause at the age of 37 and experienced anxiety, brain fog, persistently itchy ears and darkening of skin, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10092853/" target="_blank"&gt;melasma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas says there are other pharmaceutical options that she prescribes patients to address specific symptoms. Frequent, heavy bleeding during periods for example — which can &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/press-releases/are-you-just-tired-or-are-you-menopause-tired" target="_blank"&gt;lead to anemia and fatigue&lt;/a&gt; — can be addressed with birth control or an IUD, which may even stop their periods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think of it as a really nice way of cheating the menopause transition," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Embrace healthy aging habits&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some symptoms associated with perimenopause may have more to do with the aging process.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that in both men and women, there are jumps in aging that happen around the ages of 45 and 60. "A lot of women will notice a change in metabolism," says Santoro. "It's not all menopause."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Because of these changes, says Santoro, it's especially important to double down on healthy habits including diet, exercise — especially resistance training, for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/18/1231552773/protein-diet-muscle-strength-training-muscle-loss-women" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining muscle&lt;/a&gt; — and healthy sleep. " Pretty much what your mother told you — just do more of it," says Santoro.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas advises her patients to "be very meticulous about what we're fueling our bodies with. As we age, we're not getting another one."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who may have been able to "get away with not exercising as much or eating whatever we wanted in our younger years" may have to make some significant changes to maintain health, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Those kinds of behavioral adjustments, she says, can have profound impacts "that just giving somebody a pill" can't match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"They give themselves to anybody without prejudice, which seems like a lovely trait, but at the end of the day there is a reason why the human brain evolved to be a little bit suspicious of a new person. You don't know if that person is there to hurt you or to love you, and they [a person with WS] cannot make that distinction," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the last decade, scientists have learned more about the condition, which is offering a unique window into how some of the traits that make us human – such as kindness, trust, and friendliness – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4326252/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;First off, some facts. Humans have 46 chromosomes, organised into 23 pairs. During sperm or egg development, a process called '&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/genotes/knowledge-hub/meiosis/#:~:text=Recombination,per%20homologous%20pair%20per%20meiosis." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recombination'&lt;/a&gt; occurs where genetic material is swapped between matching pairs of chromosomes. However in WS, the process &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437774/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;goes wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole section of DNA from one copy of chromosome seven is accidentally deleted. As a result, people with WS are missing one copy of between 25-27 genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images Some unpublished research suggests that fruit flies lacking a gene thought to be involved in Williams Syndrome prefer to eat together (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Some unpublished research suggests that fruit flies lacking a gene thought to be involved in Williams Syndrome prefer to eat together (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These genes serve various functions. For example one, ELN, codes for a protein called elastin, which provides flexibility and elasticity to tissues throughout the body. A lack of elastin causes the artery walls to stiffen, leading to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437774/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lifelong cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; for people with Williams Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="a-social-gene" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="a-social-gene" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;A social gene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet pinpointing the gene, or genes, responsible for the increased friendliness of people with WS has proved more elusive. One theory is that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01977-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004222019770%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;BAZ1B could have a role&lt;/a&gt; here too. Some neural-crest cells go on to form the adrenal glands, which, through their release of adrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response. It's feasible that people with fewer or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4096361/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;impaired neural crest cells&lt;/a&gt; could produce less adrenaline. This, in turn, could make them less fearful of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Meanwhile, other scientists believe that a gene called GTF2I could be responsible. For example, research has shown that individual animals who lack GTF2I tend to be more social than other members of their species. Unpublished research suggests that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240228/GTF2I-genes-role-in-Williams-syndrome-and-autism-unraveled.aspx" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt; who don't have the gene like to eat together. Mice without GTF2I are more likely to approach a second &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;'stranger' mouse&lt;/a&gt;. Dogs also contain a variant of the GTF2I gene thought to make it less effective, which could explain their overt sociability and friendliness compared to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700398" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, people who have a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21658581/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;duplication of the gene&lt;/a&gt; tend to develop a form of autism characterised by social phobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which GTF2I controls sociability isn't known. The protein GTF2I codes for is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05612-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it helps to regulate the expression of many other genes. One theory holds that the personality profile of WS individuals could be related to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;impairment of myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the insulating layer or 'sheath' that wraps around nerves, especially those in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Just like the electrical cable in your house, which is covered by a plastic insulation layer, myelin is crucial for the proper transmission of electrical signals from one neuron to another," says Boaz Barak, an associate professor at Tel Aviv University in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Barak and colleagues recently &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that not only were mice bred to lack GTF2I more social, but that their neurons contained less myelin. Giving them a drug that improved myelination made their behaviour more like that of other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Individuals with Williams Syndrome have amazing traits that neurotypical people could learn from – Boaz Barak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As myelin dramatically speeds up the rate at which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(06)02523-1?script=true&amp;amp;code=cell-site" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;electrical signals can travel&lt;/a&gt;, one explanation is that the loss of myelin could lead to slower, sluggish nerve cells. This could explain some of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-024-05222-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cognitive difficulties&lt;/a&gt; faced by people with Williams Syndrome, as well as the poor &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/glia.23868" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;motor skills&lt;/a&gt; associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"What we discovered is that when you don't have GTF2I, the myelination process is impaired, leading to weak communication between the brain regions responsible for fear, and those in charge of social decision-making," says Barak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Intriguingly, a FDA approved drug called clemastine – commonly used to treat allergies – is known to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-021-03465-0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;improve myelination&lt;/a&gt;. As brain samples donated by people with Williams Syndrome also show impairments in myelination, Barak and his team plan to repurpose clemastine as a potential treatment for the condition.

Mitochondria are the powerplants present in every cell that produce energy for the body to use. Brain samples from individuals with Williams Syndrome also show that their mitochondria do not develop and function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;The specific balance [of GTF2I] is probably quite important, as being too friendly is not a good thing, but not being friendly enough is also not a good thing – Alysson Muotri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Neurons need energy in order to do their job, and what we found is that without GTF2I, the network of mitochondria does not form correctly," says Barak.

In 2016, his team took stem cells from the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4995142/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discarded baby teeth of children with WS&lt;/a&gt;. The cells were then reprogrammed to form neurons capable of forming connections, just like those seen in developing brains. On close examination, the neurons of these lab-grown mini brains were remarkably different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There were more synapses than normal, so the neurons were more branched and made more contacts," says Muotri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19067" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, the team also examined post-mortem samples taken from people with WS who had donated their brains to science. The same patterns were observed – the neurons of people with WS were more branched and formed more connections with other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although Muotri and his team haven't yet unravelled all of the circuits involved, he suggests that it's likely that in WS, the frontal cortex forms more connections with the parts of the brain involved in reward. "When you remember someone or see someone that you like, your brain releases dopamine which creates a good sensation," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think people with Williams Syndrome might have a dysregulation in this neurotransmitter. So when they see a new face, they immediately get a release of dopamine, and they feel good about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the flip side of the coin, the team found that mini brains grown using stem cells from children with autism have fewer neuronal connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We showed that if you lower the expression of the [GTF2I] gene, you make more connections, and if you increase the expression of the gene, you create less connections – which is amazing," says Muotri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As traits like trust, kindness, and friendliness are so important to human survival, Muotri believes that evolution must keep a tight rein on the expression of the GTF2I gene. Humans are a social species, and our very survival rests on collaborating with one another. We need to be able to trust each other to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The specific balance [of GTF2I] is probably quite important, as being too friendly is not a good thing, but not being friendly enough is also not a good thing," says Muotri.

As per the WHO Director General’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-covid-19-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-covid-19-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standing recommendations for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, Member States are recommended to continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination based on the recommendations of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization&lt;/a&gt; (SAGE).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2
 continues to undergo sustained evolution since its emergence in humans,
 with important genetic and antigenic changes in the spike protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
 objective of an update to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition is to 
enhance vaccine-induced immune responses to circulating SARS-CoV-2 
variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition&lt;/a&gt; (TAG-CO-VAC) advises manufacturers that &lt;strong&gt;monovalent JN.1 or KP.2&lt;/strong&gt; vaccines remain appropriate vaccine antigens; &lt;strong&gt;monovalent LP.8.1&lt;/strong&gt; is a suitable alternative vaccine antigen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
 accordance with WHO SAGE policy, vaccination should not be delayed in 
anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition&lt;/a&gt;
 (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to closely monitor the genetic and antigenic 
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 
infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 
vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO 
advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the 
implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition.
 In April 2024, the TAG-CO-VAC &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-04-2024-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-04-2024-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recommended the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccine antigen&lt;/a&gt;
 as one approach to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to 
JN.1 and its descendent lineages. In December 2024, the TAG-CO-VAC 
advised retaining the use of a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/23-12-2024-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/news/item/23-12-2024-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccine antigen&lt;/a&gt;.
 Multiple manufacturers (using mRNA, recombinant protein-based, and 
adenovirus-vectored platforms) have updated COVID-19 vaccine antigen 
composition to monovalent JN.1 lineage formulations (JN.1 or KP.2). 
Several of these vaccines have been approved for use by regulatory 
authorities and introduced into vaccination programmes in some countries
 during the second half of 2024. Previous statements from the TAG-CO-VAC
 can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
 TAG-CO-VAC reconvened on 6-7 May 2025 to review the genetic and 
antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2; immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 
infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination; the performance of currently 
approved vaccines against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; and the 
implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence reviewed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
 published and unpublished evidence reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC included:
 (1) SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution with additional support from the WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-sars-cov-2-virus-evolution" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-sars-cov-2-virus-evolution" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution&lt;/a&gt; (TAG-VE);
 (2) Antigenic characterization of previous and emerging SARS-CoV-2 
variants using virus neutralization tests with animal antisera and 
further analysis of antigenic relationships using antigenic cartography;
 (3) Immunogenicity data on the breadth of neutralizing antibody 
responses elicited by currently approved vaccine antigens against 
circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants using animal and human sera; (4) 
Preliminary immunogenicity data on immune responses following infection 
with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; (5) Available vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved vaccines during 
periods of JN.1 lineage circulation; and (6) Preliminary non-clinical 
and clinical immunogenicity data on the performance of candidate 
vaccines with updated antigens shared confidentially by vaccine 
manufacturers with TAG-CO-VAC. Further details on the data reviewed by 
the TAG-CO-VAC can be found in the accompanying data annex. Confidential
 data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC are not shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of available evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There
 are persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases, 
hospitalizations and deaths, from WHO Member States, making 
epidemiological trends difficult to infer. Nonetheless, in 2025, 
SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally, causing severe disease, post
 COVID-19 condition, and death. The majority of COVID-19 deaths continue
 to occur in individuals aged 65 years and older and those with 
coexisting conditions. Some countries have reported an increase in 
incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among children
 under 1 year of age, as compared to young adults, although this group 
still accounts for a small proportion of total COVID-19 hospitalizations
 and deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of May 2025, currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 
variants are derived from JN.1. The weekly proportion of Variant Under 
Monitoring (VUM) LP.8.1 among all SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to 
GISAID continues to increase. The weekly proportion of JN.1 (Variant of 
Interest, VOI) is slowly increasing, largely due to increases in LF.7 
and its descendent variants, while all other VUMs (KP.3, KP.3.1.1, XEC, 
and LB.1) are declining. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several JN.1 derived variants have 
independently evolved changes in the spike protein at epitopes known to 
be targeted by neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Published and 
unpublished data using antisera from naïve hamsters infected with JN.1, 
KP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC or LP.8.1 or mice immunized with mRNA vaccine 
antigens JN.1, KP.2 or KP.3 showed that JN.1, KP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC, and 
LP.8.1 are antigenically closely related to each other (approximately 1 
antigenic unit in cartographic analysis, which corresponds to a 
two-fold-difference in neutralization).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In published and 
unpublished data from humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 
antigens significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers against 
all JN.1 descendent lineages tested:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis of pre- and 
post-vaccination sera from JN.1 lineage (i.e. JN.1 or KP.2) immunized 
individuals demonstrated significant rises in neutralization of JN.1 and
 its descendent lineages, including KP.3.1.1, XEC, LF.7.2.1, and LP.8.1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neutralization
 titers against LP.8.1 were generally modestly lower (2-fold reduction) 
than those against the homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contemporary
 vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are relative (rVE), rather than 
absolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals), and 
demonstrate the added or incremental protection of recent vaccination 
over and above pre-existing infection- and vaccine-derived immunity. 
Monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 COVID-19 vaccines were introduced into some 
vaccination programmes in the second half of 2024. There are only a few 
studies estimating rVE for the monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 mRNA COVID-19 
vaccines during periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation. Both 
vaccines demonstrated additional protection—relative to pre-existing 
immunity—against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 during the first three 
to four months after vaccination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers showed that:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunization
 of naïve mice, as well as of mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 
variants, with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines resulted in high 
neutralizing antibody titers against JN.1 and its derivatives 
including KP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC, LP.8.1, and LF.7.2. However, 
neutralization titers against LP.8.1 were typically lower than those 
against the homologous immunizing antigen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunization of naïve
 mice, as well as of mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants,
 with monovalent LP.8.1 vaccine candidates elicited high neutralizing 
antibody titers against the homologous antigen. Cross-neutralizing 
antibody titers elicited against other JN.1 lineage 
variants including JN.1, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, XEC, and LF.7.2 were 
similar or modestly higher than those elicited by JN.1 or KP.2 antigens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
 humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 antigens resulted in 
robust neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and descendent variants, 
including KP.3.1.1, XEC, LP.8.1, and LF.7.2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As in non-clinical 
data, analysis of pre- and post-vaccination sera from JN.1 or KP.2 
immunized individuals showed some variation in neutralizing antibody 
titers against LP.8.1 and LF.7.2 across different studies. In most 
instances, they were similar or lower than those against the 
homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the 
currently approved monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines continue to elicit 
broadly cross-reactive immune responses to circulating JN.1-derived 
variants. LP.8.1 as a vaccine antigen offers similar or modestly 
increased cross-reactive antibody responses to circulating JN.1-derived 
variants, as compared to monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines. Mathematical 
modeling indicates that an increase in neutralizing antibody titers may 
translate into an improvement in vaccine effectiveness and duration of 
protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of available data: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There
 are persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases, 
hospitalizations and deaths, from WHO Member States, as well as in 
genetic/genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 globally, including low 
numbers of samples sequenced and limited geographic diversity. The 
TAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the ongoing work of the WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Coronavirus Network&lt;/a&gt; (CoViNet) and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System&lt;/a&gt; (GISRS) to address this information gap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The
 timing, specific mutations and antigenic characteristics of emerging 
and future variants are difficult to predict, and the potential public 
health impact of these variants remain unknown. There are JN.1-derived 
variants and long branch saltation variants that are currently detected 
in low or very low proportions, and which will continue to be monitored 
and/or characterized. The TAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the ongoing work 
of the TAG-VE. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although neutralizing antibody titers 
have been shown to be important correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2
 infection and of estimates of vaccine effectiveness, there are multiple
 components of immune protection elicited by infection and/or 
vaccination. Data on the immune responses following JN.1 descendent 
lineage infection or monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccination are largely 
restricted to neutralizing antibodies. Data and interpretation of other 
aspects of the immune response, including cellular immunity, are 
limited. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunogenicity data against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are not available for all COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimates
 of rVE against recently circulating JN.1 variants are limited in terms 
of the number of studies, geographic diversity, vaccine platforms 
evaluated, populations assessed, duration of follow-up, and contemporary
 comparisons of vaccines with different antigen composition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monovalent
 JN.1 (NextStrain: 24A, GenBank: PP298019, GISAID: EPI_ISL_18872762) or 
KP.2 vaccines remain appropriate for ongoing use; monovalent LP.8.1 
(NextStrain: 25A; GenBank: PV074550.1; GISAID: EPI_ISL_19467828) is a 
suitable alternative vaccine antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches that 
demonstrate broad and robust neutralizing antibody responses or efficacy
 against currently circulating JN.1 descendent lineage variants could 
also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the WHO Director General’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-covid-19-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-covid-19-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standing recommendations for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, Member States are recommended to continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination based on the recommendations of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO SAGE&lt;/a&gt;.

 the limitations of the evidence upon which the recommendations above 
are derived and the anticipated continued evolution of the virus, the 
TAG-CO-VAC strongly encourages generation of the following data (in 
addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-03-2025-types-of-data-requested-to-inform-may-2025-covid-19-vaccine-antigen-composition-deliberations" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-03-2025-types-of-data-requested-to-inform-may-2025-covid-19-vaccine-antigen-composition-deliberations" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;types of data outlined in March 2025&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immune

 epidemiological surveillance to characterize disease severity in 
immunologically naïve and/ or immature individuals (i.e. birth cohorts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clinical evaluation of relevant new vaccine antigens derived from more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
 previously stated, the TAG-CO-VAC continues to encourage the further 
development of vaccines that may improve protection against infection 
and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TAG-CO-VAC will 
continue to closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of 
SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against 
circulating variants. The TAG-CO-VAC will also continue to reconvene 
every six months, or as needed, to evaluate the implications for 
COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. At each meeting, recommendations 
to either maintain current vaccine composition or to consider updates 
will be issued. Prior to each meeting, the TAG-CO-VAC will publish an 
update to the statement on the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-03-2025-types-of-data-requested-to-inform-may-2025-covid-19-vaccine-antigen-composition-deliberations" data-mce-href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-03-2025-types-of-data-requested-to-inform-may-2025-covid-19-vaccine-antigen-composition-deliberations" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;types of data requested to inform COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition deliberations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

New York State is one of the highest risk states for ticks, which can spread diseases like lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a tick, all you have to do is spend some time outdoors. Upstate University Hospital Doctor Saravanan Thangamani is concerned about the increase in the number of ticks submitted to the lab for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My concern is the rise in the number of ticks and the rise in the number of human interactions," Dr. Thangamani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of ticks submitted to the hospital for review has increased by 200% in 2025 since this time last year. Experts say this could be due to the extended winter seasons and to pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs can easily contract on these bugs in their fur while playing or using the bathroom outside. Then, when they step inside, they can easily pass it off to their owners just with one pet on the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thangamani said he isn't just worried about the increase in ticks. He's also worried about the increase in the pathogens they carry. Some examples are lyme disease or anaplasmosis, a flu-like illness that left untreated can turn to hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Town of Manlius has a proactive approach to addressing lyme disease and the spread of ticks. The town managers the deer population, a frequent source for ticks. This program in the community has run for several years. The managing of the deer population in the area is also to reduce car accidents and protect vegetation on people's property. In 2024, 53 deer were removed from the Town of Manlius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a poll made by the town board, residents have said that they haven't seen many changes to the number of ticks they encouncter. However, they are hopeful the program will have an impact on the community in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSTM</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 09:57:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQYm9ReUcwajZPR1BQMEVhSWpaWEpsVmVHVWo5NE5ldVE5bnFsZlBCblpfbXpBaDl2NFFiTTZtVjRjYnFyVDJyMXRRSFEtVDZ6Y015RXlVWkNjQXRhSk10STg0QWsxTHI1RFN2Q3o1QU42X0M4cnJjSlBGd056bER4Wm9tbjd6NGs3eHhXRlloWUQ2RlNfRHR0NmxueGNJdDhKZm1sbXhwRlljQVVQYUE</guid></item><item><title>专家对三种流行香料的致命风险发出警告-数百万人可能面临风险-每日邮报 | Expert issues warning over deadly risk of three popular spices - millions could be at risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOTVcxQkZTWlp0SnZXUnNEUVlVRGxuRmJCa0ZENHpzVWdPLTNhWmhTSDdzdnI4UHRfN1cyM3VDTWx2Qm84SXpVWGE1MFg5R291TVQ0eG1vcDdDUXkxaFZlaFdPRm9GLXRMd1Uza3BlUVIybktqTzA4d2ZySGRGMjVreFJoVS1CNV9kRHE5TnlZZ2x1eVhfcEdycU5qclBhWW0xSW9yRkZpYmJUcE5PcUlyeG1nWHQ3aGRy0gG-AUFVX3lxTFBrX01fSzJBVkdzbVRFRnloQ1FqUEZOQ2tyR0VXUDRoc0ZEYzBwSjhFcmJJaHlWRkI1MjZOTWt0SkFvRXQtazZOOWgxUlE5SFpvdlItMHFaZkZGb0hOem5zUUhBT200cnFyb0tWOUZFWlNJQnBQVXdkUjk2RTZLT3NNWHc0alZqdGZxTzNkcEZvS0NoYkNQSnBGencyMnExQlhaQmdFc2Q4c053N0g3ek5GSWR2V0hOd0xCWUhfYmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three popular household spices used in everything from cakes to curries may make life-saving drugs useless, a medicines expert has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon, turmeric and ginger—said to naturally reduce inflammation and boost the immune system—can affect how the body metabolises a range of drugs, including those used to treat high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-24855800-3162-11f0-95e2-1d6878e0e4d9" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and common infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study found that the main compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, which gives the spice its unique smell and taste, also activates receptors that trigger the body to process drugs much more rapidly, reducing their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While people who sprinkle cinnamon on their porridge should be safe, people who take cinnamon supplements could be at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overconsumption could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective', scientist Shabana Khan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that for some medications, such as blood thinners, the rapid metabolism spurred by cinnamon can exacerbate the drug's effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of aspirin and warfarin, this means a risk of potentially deadly bleeding, according to Professor Dipa Kamdar, a pharmacist from Kingston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cinnamon has previously been associated with reducing inflammation and boosting heart health, but some cheaper varieties could interfere with life-saving medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who take blood thinning medication should be caution when using cinnamon, experts advise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts now say the type of cinnamon matters too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'True' cinnamon, a more expensive version of the spice originating from Sri Lanka, has been linked to a range of health benefits: it's rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, helps regulate blood sugar levels and has even been found to lower the risk of heart disease, according to Dr Kamdar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon bark, however, which is usually found in supermarkets, contains high levels of coumarin, which can cause liver damage in high doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also suggests that cinnamon could interact with other medications, like statins and antidepressants, making them more potent or less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another household staple with adverse side effects is turmeric, which has previously been linked with liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric has long been lauded for its anti-inflammatory properties, found in everything from immune boosting shots to curries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There's evidence that curcumin [the active ingredient in turmeric] can affect how some drugs are metabolised by interfering with liver enzymes [that process drugs],' Prof Kamdar explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Curcumin is a compound that naturally occurs in turmeric, giving it its bright yellow colour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Turmeric has also been lauded for its anti-inflammatory properties but experts say it has also been linked with liver failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that taking multiple supplements at one time carries potential dangers due to unknown interactions that can make prescription drugs more potent or less effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Kamdar continued: 'This means it could potentially interact with antidepressants, blood pressure medications, chemotherapy drugs and certain antibiotics.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In extreme cases, high doses of curcumin taken with black pepper—which helps the body absorb the spice—have been linked to severe liver damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in The American Journal of Medicine, researchers looked at the turmeric-associated liver injury cases recorded in the US between 2004 and 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They discovered 10 cases of liver damage caused by the spice. Five people were hospitalised and one person died of &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548561/"&gt;acute liver failure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 62-year-old woman had no history of liver disease and was taking turmeric root extract for her arthritis. She was also taking tramadol—a strong painkiller—a nasal decongestant for her allergies, and other multivitamins including ginger and vitamin D. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She developed fatigue and nausea followed by jaundice, after taking turmeric once daily for 14 months. She stopped taking the supplement, but her symptoms did not improve and she was listed for a liver transplant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She died within five weeks of the onset of symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors concluded that the liver failure was probably caused by turmeric, which could have interacted with the other medications she was taking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The NHS warns taking herbal supplements could make other medicines trigger unexpected side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Kamdar also speculated that, because turmeric has been found to lower blood sugar levels in animals, it could have the same effect in humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This means it could increase the effects of anti-diabetic drugs or insulin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Additionally, turmeric has been shown to reduce blood pressure, which when combined with blood pressure medications could cause an excessive drop', the pharmacist explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, she stressed: 'As with cinnamon, these effects are most often linked to high dose supplements, not the small amounts used in food.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ginger is another common spice lauded for its anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory effects. But, Prof Kamdar warns, its active compounds could interfere with the body's ability to process medication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies suggest high doses of ginger may lower blood sugar, potentially increasing the impact of diabetes medication, risking deadly hypoglycemia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ginger can also act as a mild blood thinner, Dr Kamdar added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'If you're taking medications, especially blood thinners, diabetes medicines, or chemotherapy drugs, it's worth having a quick chat with your doctors or pharmacist before starting any new herbal supplements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'But for most people, using spices in typical culinary amounts is safe. So go ahead: sprinkle, pinch, or dash—just be mindful of what's in your medicine cabinet—and be wary of taking any herbal supplement in high doses.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the NHS, around 350,000 people are prescribed blood thinners every year, putting millions of people who take this medication alongside herbal supplements at risk of potentially deadly bleeding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of people taking anticoagulants is set to rise, following a major NHS drive to rapidly expand their use to help prevent stroke fatalities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Dr Kamdar warns, that taking these spices in high doses at a regular basis alongside these prescription drugs could have potentially life-threatening side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that "colibactin leaves behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that were 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases (specifically in adults under 40) than in those diagnosed after the age of 70," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; UC San Diego Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There was also a positive relationship between the countries with a higher number of colorectal cancer cases in younger people and the presence of these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature, showed that colibactin's damaging effects may silently begin early in a person's life. Colibactin-producing bacteria that enter a child's body may grow inside the colon and cause molecular changes in their DNA, putting them at risk for colorectal cancer decades earlier than has been typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It might not be just about what happens in adulthood—cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Ludmil Alexandrov, senior author on the study. "Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it's too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this notable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These findings may prove invaluable in addressing the rise of cancer in younger people, an unexpected colorectal cancer patient population until recently. But, while the research didn't focus on environmental concerns, it could also raise questions about how our changing climate might increase health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Climate shifts can increase the spread of colibactin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. Higher temperatures can be conducive to bacterial growth. Meanwhile, heavy rains and flooding can drive water contamination by flushing surface-level pollutants into farms and water supplies and by overwhelming sewage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher amounts of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; contamination following extreme weather events could create higher levels of colibactin exposure. The threats could be even greater in low- and middle-income countries lacking sufficient infrastructure for clean water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about toxins that might harm health?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/stay-safe-from-toxins/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:range of toxins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;range of toxins&lt;/a&gt; in our environment have posed problems for some time. For example, "forever chemicals" in household goods and water systems are already considered a public health concern — now scientists and lawmakers are working on ways to address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To learn more about connections between colibactin and colorectal cancer, researchers want to understand how children are being exposed and how to prevent that exposure. They are testing hypotheses and exploring whether probiotics can eliminate this harmful bacteria. They are also working on early-detection tests to check for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individuals can help support scientific research like this by &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/vote-for-pro-climate-candidates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advocating for policies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;advocating for policies&lt;/a&gt; that prioritize pro-environment studies and protections.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bananas drastically reduce flavanol absorption in smoothies — by about 84% — due to their high levels of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flavanols are important for healthy aging and mental health, with benefits seen especially in women, according to recent studies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To maximize flavanol intake, blend flavanol-rich fruits like berries with low-PPO ingredients such as pineapple, mango, oranges, or yogurt — and avoid bananas in the mix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The next time you go to make a smoothie, think long and hard about what you add to it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In May, &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/study-shows-you-should-skip-bananas-in-smoothies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;SciTechDaily&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/fo/d3fo01599h" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Food and Function&lt;/a&gt; that examined how an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase (PPO) affects the absorption of flavan-3-ols, a subclass of flavanols, in the human body. This enzyme is critical as it causes fruits to turn brown, including bananas and apples. Flavanols are equally important for human health, as they help improve our overall well-being and can aid in aging gracefully. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Food &amp;amp; Wine recently explained, a 2025 study in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121914.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; showed that individuals who consumed higher quantities of flavanols had a lower risk of frailty and a decreased risk of poor mental health as they age. The findings were more pronounced in women; however, men also experienced a net positive benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And because &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/smoothie-recipes-7093304" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt; have long been a popular choice for health-conscious individuals seeking to consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, the researchers of the study aimed to test how different fruit combinations affect the absorption of key nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To investigate this, researchers recruited volunteers who were tasked with consuming smoothies with high PPO activity, including those containing bananas, and &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-to-make-a-smoothie-8712835" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt; with low PPO fruits, such as mixed berries. Participants also took flavanol supplements in capsules to serve as a control. They then had their blood drawn to measure the difference. According to the findings, bananas may be doing more harm than good in that smoothie mix. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings noted that drinking the banana smoothie drastically reduced the amount of flavonols the body absorbed, and not just by a little. It reduced absorption by about 84% compared to the groups that had the capsules or the berry smoothie. The reason, the team explained, is that PPO interacts with flavanols quickly, causing them to degrade and preventing them from entering your bloodstream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Perhaps most surprisingly, even when participants consumed flavanols separately from the banana smoothie (taking alternating sips of the berry smoothie) absorption was still negatively impacted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what you can take away from this study, it's that fruits like berries remain an excellent choice for your next blended drink. Perhaps you could simply enjoy that banana on its own as a snack later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Smoothies are a popular way to pack fruit and vegetables into our morning routines. We know from previous studies that flavanols can be broken down by polyphenol oxidase. The extent of the effect from adding a single banana was still very surprising — it had enough polyphenol oxidase to destroy the vast majority of flavanols found in the berries," Gunter Kuhnle, a professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading and co-investigator of the study, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news/2023/Research-News/Avoid-going-bananas-to-avoid-this-common-smoothie-slip-up" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Want to punch up the flavanols even more? Kuhnle had the answer. “If you want to boost your flavanol intake with a smoothie, you should combine flavanol-rich fruits like berries with foods that have a low polyphenol oxidase activity like pineapple, oranges, mango, or yogurt.”&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick and easy way to raise your heart rate, buy a jump rope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cheap and portable, so you can take it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it offers plenty of benefits, improving your cardio, stamina and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love a fitness challenge and I wanted to experience all these benefits for myself, so I decided to skip a minute a day for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down to see how I got on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-skipping-every-day-taught-me"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What skipping every day taught me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-learned-to-let-go"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned to let go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being fairly fit, the first week of the challenge was difficult and a little painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept whipping my ankles with the rope and felt frustrated (I blame my poor coordination).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-q9XczqsHW9P8hmjSrBszNW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-q9XczqsHW9P8hmjSrBszNW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But focusing on things going wrong seemed to make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I allowed myself to let go and shrug off any notions of possible failure, I had fewer ankle whips and enjoyed myself more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-felt-less-anxious"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I felt less anxious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find exercise is a great mood booster, calming my anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, doing just 60 seconds of jump rope boosted my mood to the same degree as my usual 30-minute strength session or HIIT workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping forced me to focus, which cleared my mind and allowed me to be in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-a-great-tool-for-developing-endurance"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a great tool for developing endurance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump rope is an excellent endurance workout, and over time, I noticed my stamina had improved when I was doing other workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently did a four-hour hike in Wales. It was a challenging route with lots of steep inclines and descents, but I found it easier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, I did another long hilly walk, this time wearing my weighted vest, and it felt great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only right at the end, after two hours of non-stop walking and talking, that I needed a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-improved-my-cardio-fitness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It improved my cardio fitness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a month of skipping every day, I noticed that my heart rate was lower during the skipping than it had been at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a clear sign that my cardio capability has improved, which is good news for my general health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I don't intend to continue skipping every day, I'll definitely use it in my regular workouts and pack my rope with me for my next vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; announced that 11 children are hospitalized with measles, three of whom are in a serious condition, as of Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the hospitalized children had been fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the measles outbreak, 48 have been hospitalized, 40 of whom have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures raise concern within the health system, partly because the amount of reported cases likely only represents a portion of the virus's actual spread among the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior health officials also warn of a potential mass infection at the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/lag-baomer"&gt;Lag Ba'omer&lt;/a&gt; Mount Meron pilgrimage, as vaccination rates in certain haredi (ultra-Orthodox) communities remain very low.&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Highly contagious disease. Child with measles. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry held urgent discussions with representatives from health maintenance organizations, and following consultations, decided to advance the timing of the second measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/vaccine"&gt;vaccine dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was previously given to children at six years old, but will now be administered in areas with active cases or heightened outbreak risk, starting from one month after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is measles? Symptoms and treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-851840"&gt;Measles is an acute viral disease&lt;/a&gt;, highly contagious and transmitted through airborne respiratory droplets. Its infection rate is considered among the highest of viral illnesses, with an unvaccinated person exposed to a patient having about a 90% chance of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after infection and include high fever, runny nose, fatigue, conjunctivitis, dry cough, and a characteristic rash spreading from the face to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients recover within a few days, but the disease can complicate into pneumonia, ear infections, liver damage, and rarely, acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months and sometimes years after infection, a severe chronic nervous system disorder called SSPE (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis) can develop. This is a progressive, incurable degenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, movement disorders, neurological seizures, and death. SSPE’s estimated incidence is about 1 in 10,000 cases, but the risk is significantly higher in infants under one year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include decreased consciousness, vomiting, light sensitivity, and neck stiffness&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Cases of the measles rise in Israel. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing dedicated vaccination centers nationwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Health Ministry opened dedicated vaccination centers nationwide that allow walk-in immunizations without appointments. The ministry urges the public to check the list of centers on its website and to arrive up to 30 minutes before closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of children under six are asked to complete the vaccination series with the “Tipat Halav” (maternal and child health clinics), while children over seven can be vaccinated at the new centers or health funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is included in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) combination and is generally administered in two doses: at one year and six years of age. However, due to the current outbreak, the ministry is advancing the second dose in defined areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults born after 1957 who are unsure of their vaccination status are asked to check their records and complete vaccination if necessary. The ministry notes that people born before 1957 are generally considered immune, having likely been exposed to the virus during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women who are unvaccinated, infants, and immunocompromised individuals may also require passive immunization with antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors worldwide have noted a decline in vaccination rates since the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend affecting Israel as well. Avoidance of routine vaccinations combined with rising vaccine skepticism has created susceptible populations lacking immunity, leading to recurring measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and adults unsure of their vaccination status can contact their health fund nurse or the Health Ministry’s hotline by dialing *5400. The ministry also recommends that any traveler abroad who has not received two measles vaccine doses get vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to recognize signs of measles infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles infection often begins with a seven to 14-day incubation period. General symptoms during the first stage of infection include a high fever, runny nose, severe fatigue, dry cough, and eye inflammation. During the second stage, more unique symptoms, such as small white spots on a red background inside the cheeks, known as Koplik spots, sometimes appear before the rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third stage is the rash appearing, including a dense red rash starting on the face, before spreading to the neck, torso, arms, and legs. The rash often lasts between four and seven days, and may be accompanied by significant weight loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible complications from a measles infection include pneumonia, ear infections, diarrhea, and acute encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avihai Chiim contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We talked about the Manet exhibition we had just seen at the National Gallery. We probably talked about how the end of the cold war might affect the chances of Bill Clinton winning the presidential election against George HW Bush in November. I know what John thought about that. I only wish I could recall his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The next morning, 30 July 1992, John got up before me as he always did. In the kitchen I found the contents of the dishwasher – knives, forks, spoons, plates, mugs – jumbled together on the table. This was odd because unloading the dishwasher was the one domestic ritual he willingly performed. It would be years before I learned the reason. At the time I put it down to absent-mindedness. It was a month since he had delivered a book to the publisher and he was already preoccupied by the next one, about art in the European Renaissance. Before I had time to be annoyed, I heard a crash from his study at the top of the house. I ran upstairs and found him lying on the floor next to his desk. He looked up at me with the radiant, witless smile of a baby. And he said: “Da walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/stroke","type":"Keyword","title":"Stroke"},{"id":"news/series/the-long-read","type":"Series","title":"The long read"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/physiotherapists","type":"Keyword","title":"Physiotherapists"},{"id":"science/neuroscience","type":"Keyword","title":"Neuroscience"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/the-long-read","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"The Long Read"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/long-read","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Long Read"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/15/husband-son-stroke-30-years-apart-treatment","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"abPrebidId5":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"europeBetaFrontTest2":false,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"dcrJavascriptBundle":false,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"abA9BidResponseWinner":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"lineItemJobs":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":false,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ambulance took us to the local hospital where they said that my husband had had cerebral accident – a stroke. The cause was probably years of uncontrolled high blood pressure, about which no doctor had warned him. They said he needed rest and reassurance. Unfortunately, because of the so-called efficiency savings introduced by John Major’s government, there was a shortage of beds and of nurses in all London hospitals. I was so grateful when they found a bed for him in a geriatric ward later in the day that I didn’t at first notice how filthy it was and how hot. The floor was covered in urine, blood and dust balls. (Later I brought in a mop to clean around John’s bed.) The plateglass window could not be opened: to prevent suicides, a passing nurse told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a week before I managed to track down the doctor whose name was printed on a grimy card at the head of John’s bed. The doctor informed me that my husband’s case was hopeless. He would never walk again and must never be allowed to try to stand because the hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall. Physiotherapy, which the doctor considered “about as useful as peanut butter”, was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;You learn fast in an emergency. John had had an ischaemic stroke, which is a blockage in one of the arteries that carries blood to the brain, resulting in the death of brain tissue. It was in his left brain, which controls the right limbs and, in most people, the processing of language. About 75% of people will survive a first stroke. But it is essential to get them up and standing as soon as possible, and paralysed limbs should be moved to prevent the muscles from seizing up permanently. Visiting family and friends were happy to help, moving John’s arms and legs while they sat with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;John greeted everyone with those two meaningless syllables, &lt;em&gt;da walls. &lt;/em&gt;He also used the same sounds to ask them questions about themselves: “Walls? Da walls?” He chatted away in his usual sociable manner with his fellow patients, and even charmed the few overworked nurses. The rise and fall, the rhythms and pitch of his voice were so normal that those of us who knew him well understood at least the gist of what he was not saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since he could read, we assumed he could also write; he was after all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/13/guardianobituaries1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a writer.&lt;/a&gt; We gave him a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen, which he seized in his good left hand, and, on the top left corner of the page he wrote the letter “f” and then gave up. John had what is called expressive aphasia. Although he could tell that we didn’t understand him, it felt to him as though he was translating his thoughts as effectively and comprehensibly as ever into words. I was only one of the many people who had a recurring dream that John had suddenly started to talk normally. As one friend said, it was as if he were under a magic spell and, like all magic spells, it would be lifted as suddenly as it came on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he neurologists and clinicians who specialise in stroke talk a lot about pathways. There are the pathways of neurons and synapses that are interrupted by a clot or haemorrhage, pathways from the onset of symptoms to hospital. Although the consequences of a stroke do not necessarily get worse over time, the pathway to recovery is problematic, as I was to discover. My own pathway towards an understanding of what stroke is and does, and how it can be addressed, began in that unclean geriatric ward where the doctor condemned his stroke patients to live diminished lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My concern at the time was to escape from that hospital to a place that would help my husband. The Wolfson neurorehabilitation centre at Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon, which had an excellent reputation for stroke rehabilitation, did not admit patients over 65 on the NHS. They would, however, accept John privately – at a price that would have meant selling our house. With some difficulty, I found a bed in a hospital at the other end of London. It was at least clean. And although there was no physiotherapy available, the nurses, immediately on John’s arrival, got him up on his feet and limping, with their support, up and down the ward. All too soon they informed me that they would have to discharge him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then I found that John’s service in the second world war entitled him to a place in the Royal Star &amp;amp; Garter for Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen. A large and handsome building, overlooking the Thames from the brow of Richmond Hill, it had been purpose built for the care and rehabilitation of servicemen and women disabled in the first world war. (It has now, perhaps inevitably, been converted into luxury flats.) It was staffed by neurophysiotherapists, occupational therapists and a speech therapist. The physios worked on restoring not just movement of the affected limbs but movement that was as normal as possible. The physios walked him through parallel bars, guiding his bad leg into a correct position with their hands, running their hands up his spine to remind him to stand up straight. They got him to put his full weight on one leg while swinging the other. They made him do squats, holding his limp arm stretched forward with his good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b7e2c45e-863c-4c3c-b3a8-93733aa182d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sheila and John Hale. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When John came home at Easter after six months of intensive physiotherapy, he was able to dress himself and care for his personal needs. He was still limping but he was so much stronger that he walked around the house without a stick and climbed the stairs to his study. He was, however, liable to trip and fall because he had no control over his right foot. Then I heard, only by chance, that a rigid brace fitted on his foot underneath the shoe would solve that problem. Now he began to take himself on ever longer walks around the neighbourhood, chatting in those meaningless syllables with the neighbours, making new friends in the pub. We travelled, to Italy and farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ix months after the stroke, John’s vocabulary had not changed, and I was determined to find out how he might recover his use of language. The speech therapist at the Star &amp;amp; Garter had quickly given up on John: “You will never again have a conversation with your husband.” Her patronising pronouncement filled me with an energising rage that set me on a new pathway: to find out as much as I could about aphasia, and to prove her wrong about John’s case. My instinct as a journalist was to seek out expert specialists in the field; and I was not surprised to discover that the more experienced they were, the less likely they were to make predictions about John’s, or anyone else’s, chances of recovery. The people who know most about the way the brain works know that it is terra incognita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39b2b35f-a50d-48df-acf0-d888e43e8206" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;John Hale in Venice, February 1992.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Quill&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I found two speech therapists, Jane Marshall and Eirian Jones. Watching them work with John taught me so much about language, and what the loss of it tells us about normal language, that I began to plan a book about the condition (which is better known as dysphasia, rather than aphasia, because it is rare that all the elements of language are lost). I will mention here only one of Jones’s many discoveries about John’s particular case because it explains the mystery of the way he unloaded the dishwasher on the morning of his stroke. Jones’s theory was that John had lost the ability to “disambiguate” the various different contents of the dishwasher. And in the same way he could no longer unravel the elements of a sentence. So although John could write individual words, matching the correct word to a picture or filling in the missing word in a story, he had, as Jones put it, no idea of what a sentence was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On 13 September 1998, six years after the stroke, there was a stupendous breakthrough. John indicated to me that he wanted to write a thank you note to a friend who had given us lunch in his office. He got out one of his correspondence cards headed Professor Sir John Hale, and on it he wrote: “Dear David”. I said, Fine, now what is the expression of gratitude you need? John wrote: “Thanks you for lunch.” I said: Do you want to say where? John wrote: “in your office”. When? “On Thursday.” Then he wrote without prompting: “I have”. And I stupidly said, now you need either a verb or a noun. But he wrote “certainly” and laughed and finished the letter by himself: “been in luck! Yours ever, John.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I telephoned Eirian with the news. She was pleased but reminded me that it wasn’t quite the breakthrough I had initially thought – I had, in fact, guided John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went to the US to research my book on dysphasia. Back home I told John about all the people I had interviewed, one of them being Alfonso Caramazza, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Harvard. On 9 August 1999, I went out shopping. When I returned I found on John’s desk a scrap of paper on which he had written:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramagne,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thanks you for agreeing to advice Sheila to carre on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next to the draft was one of his correspondence cards on which he had written (note the style, one professor to another):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramazza,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thank you for agreeing to advise Sheila to carry on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nobody was with him. Nobody prompted or guided him or even suggested he write to Caramazza, about whom I hadn’t spoken for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I will never know how much more John would have written, because on the morning of 12 August he died peacefully in his sleep next to me in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;y book, The Man Who Lost His Language, was published in 2003. For the third edition in 2006, the publisher asked for a new chapter about any recent changes in stroke care. All my contacts led me straight to one man: Dr Tony Rudd, consultant stroke physician at St Thomas’ hospital in central London. Rudd was better known in medical and government circles as “Dr Stroke” for his tireless campaigning to get the message across that stroke, like heart attack, is both a medical emergency and a treatable illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I asked him what changes he had seen in the 14 years since John’s stroke. “There has been more progress with stroke than with any other illness,” he said. “But we started from nothing. And there are still black holes.” The failure to treat stroke properly from day one continued to be a massive waste of public money. Without treatment, the survivors will be a burden on the NHS and the welfare budget. It is not only they who will remain helpless and unproductive. Their carers, usually unpaid younger relatives, will also be unable to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But lassitude was giving way to excitement with the development of techniques which restore the flow of blood to the brain (known as reperfusion), in time to limit much of the damage caused by ischaemic stroke. Rudd had begun a programme of injecting suitable patients with a clot-busting drug. The technique, thrombolysis, is by no means suitable for every stroke. And because brain cells die in their millions during a stroke, treatment should be delivered as soon as possible, preferably within four hours. Thrombolysis was first used in the UK in the 1990s. Rudd’s hospital was the first that was equipped to deliver it to all suitable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A cheerful young Scottish nurse told me that whereas stroke used to be “the dead end of nursing”, the opportunity to give quality care to people who might otherwise have died or been permanently disabled was so rewarding that she had decided to devote her career to caring for stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went away that day daring to hope that stroke treatment, which was underserved by an underfunded, over-bureaucratised health system, might receive the attention it deserved. In 2010, following recommendations by Lord Ara Darzi, eight specialised services for stroke treatment, known as Hyper Acute Stroke Units, were established across London. Six years later, St George’s hospital in Tooting, south London, was the first of them to perform thrombectomy, which mechanically removes clots too big to respond to clot-busting drugs. This continues to be the most effective procedure and allows almost half of those treated to return to their normal life within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t 11:10am on Sunday 21 November 2021 I had a telephone call from my daughter-in-law Amanda. My son Jay, who was then 55, had fallen out of bed earlier that morning. Amanda knew it was a stroke because Jay had inherited his father’s high blood pressure, along with his insouciance about his health. She rang 999 only to be told that there would be no ambulance for four hours. A kind neighbour who is, as it happened, a doctor drove them through red lights to the nearest stroke unit. Amanda was informed that Jay was not a suitable candidate for reperfusion because the stroke had happened in his sleep and they couldn’t therefore determine whether too much time had elapsed for treatment to be effective. This was incorrect. Since Jay went to sleep at 11pm and reached the unit by 4:30am he was in good time. No doubt the hospital was overwhelmed by Covid. What happened afterwards, however, was less forgivable; nor, alas, is it an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dfb9e2da-0a36-4586-bc89-87077e590720" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jay Hale.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jay was given a bed in a dedicated stroke ward. It was immaculately clean. (The lesson of the MRSA epidemics in dirty wards had been learned.) His was a right-brain stroke paralysing his left arm and leg and affecting his left field of vision, but sparing his language. The consultants who visited him in the ward predicted, presumably on the evidence of a brain scan, that he was unlikely to walk again. Although Jay was fully conscious and able to speak normally, the consultants also informed him that he would never work again. He must under no circumstances be permitted to stand up without the help of physiotherapists, who were scarce and clocked off at 4pm. The hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall and private physiotherapy was not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without the support of his family and many friends Jay might well have given in to the despair that afflicts so many stroke survivors. He couldn’t believe what had happened to him. But he was also determined to prove that the doctors were mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike his father all those years ago, Jay was allowed small doses of physio and occupational therapy every now and then. When they had time, the physios put him on a reclining static bicycle which he enjoyed because he had always been a keen cyclist, and which encouraged him to move the bad leg by pumping with the good one. After a few weeks, he charmed two of the physios into helping him to stand up and take a step, then two steps, then walk the length of the ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Jay was discharged after four months in hospital he mostly used a wheelchair, although he was able to walk around the house with a four-legged stick. He had been warned by the hospital that he must never, ever rely on a single stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Amanda enrolled him in a private rehabilitation practice in west London run by a renowned physiotherapist named Richard Sealy. Sealy asked Jay what he wanted most to achieve, and when Jay said he wanted to walk without a stick Sealy said: “Well then do it.” Jay took a few steps. In 25 years of practice Sealey has treated 4,000 patients, including the journalist Andrew Marr after his stroke. Over the next 18 months, I watched this charming and dedicated man and his team of neurophysios and occupational therapists working with Jay to reconnect the pathways between the motor cortex of his right brain with his left leg and arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First, they got him to walk chest forward and head up – with, and then without, a stick. They tried to play football as a way of encouraging an instinct to kick. He tried to put weight and balance on his bad leg and kicking with the good one; or, and this was much harder, balance on the good leg and kick with the bad one. He did one-legged squats. He used a pilates reformer and walked on a treadmill. They timed him as he walked as fast as he could around the building, each time beating his previous record. In an attempt to wake up his left hand and arm they clasped the hand around his precious phone, hoping to trigger the instinctive grasp to stop it dropping. They tried video games played with his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By no means everybody could afford Sealy’s fees (£110 for 45 minutes). Sealy regrets leaving the NHS, where he was trained and which he says still provides the best training for physiotherapists in the world. If there is a shortage of neurotherapists in the NHS, he said, the reason they leave is less about pay than about the long hours of intensive therapy they are not allowed to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I remain haunted by the people who miss out on precious rehab. Each one of &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1.3 million stroke survivors&lt;/a&gt; in the UK has a story. Last year there were &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/11/hospital-admissions-for-strokes-rise-by-28-since-2004-as-nhs-urges-the-public-to-act-fast/#:~:text=NHS%20England%20data%20shows%20an,on%20the%20nation's%20cardiovascular%20health." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;111,137 stroke admissions to NHS hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, a rise of 28% in 10 years, and this &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/26/unsustainable-uk-predicted-to-see-50-spike-in-strokes-by-2035" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;figure is expected to rise&lt;/a&gt; dramatically. Meanwhile, 39% of stroke patients are abandoned by the NHS after six months. A third remain too disabled to work, many because they believed, or had no choice but to believe, the doctors who wrote off their chances of recovery. The population of stroke survivors is as big as that of a large city, and it’s getting bigger. More than half are left with a disability and about a third are unable to live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nor, as many young people like to imagine, is stroke a faraway illness that happens in the never-never land of old age. A quarter of people who experience strokes are under the age of 65. And in the past 10 years there has been a 55% increase in strokes among people, like my son Jay, in their 50s, which is the highest increase among any age group. The reasons may be bad diet – ultra processed food and especially sugary drinks, which are as dangerous as smoking – and uncontrolled blood pressure. The poorest members of society suffer strokes seven years earlier than the better off. Some are small strokes. They may recover spontaneously in a few weeks but even small strokes may be warnings of worse to come. Many will have lost the use of an arm and a leg, a field of vision, the production or comprehension of language. They might suffer from apraxia, an inability to sequence movements in the order it requires to perform everyday tasks. Some will find it difficult to recognise what they see, touch, hear or taste, an impairment of sensory processing known as agnosia. Visual agnosia was made famous by Oliver Sacks in his classic book &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/17/profile-oliver-sacks-author-neurologist" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/a&gt;. Others will suffer from anosognosia, a denial of their own symptoms. Every stroke is different and every brain has been conditioned by a unique set of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5f442e65-69d8-4201-b11d-d67a6500a923" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&amp;quot;richLinkIndex&amp;quot;:43,&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;prefix&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Related: &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;'Is anybody in there?'

For those who need an economic justification, a 10-year study published in 2016 and led by Prof Lynne Turner-Stokes at King’s College hospital has demonstrated that intensive therapy for all neurological illnesses saves the cost of long term care and improves the rate of productivity. This is why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) now recommends a minimum of three hours of intensive therapy at least five days a week. Yet at present, most NHS stroke units provide two or three hours of physiotherapy a week, with a six-month time-limit. Nick Ward, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, an ardent defender of rehabilitation after stroke, described this as “a homeopathic dose, not worth the cost”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why does the UK waste lives and taxpayers’ money by condemning stroke survivors to dependent, unproductive lives? Three and a half years after his stroke, my son is a living example of what can be achieved by physiotherapy, and why it is so important that more people have access to it. The hole in his brain is much bigger than it would have been if he had been treated on arrival at the stroke unit, instead of being told he was not eligible. Nevertheless, thanks to intensive neurophysiotherapy, Jay now climbs up and down two flights of stairs to their bedroom at the top of the house. He dresses and washes himself, walks around the house without a stick, around London with only a single stick, gets on and off buses and trains. He has returned to teaching mathematics, five days a week, at the school where he worked before the stroke. He swims at the local gym, where he has taught the personal trainer some of the techniques of neurophysiotherapy. Not only does he lead an independent and productive life, he is still, three and a half years post-stroke, getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPY1c0NURmVmROY1hkUkV4LXNzZ0pvXzREemI3ckZadC03T1REQXdEVk9QOHJ4TXlHM0JKMEFmREItd0ZmY1Zsa0p3Q3l0a2xWTHlMVG1uOXNlSXpjcENQUnVpX2N6QnpIalFJcDJDMmxxRGtWaW1RallieG1tYTkzYzAzN2ktbmJFWklsRG8waWtOcDZfSWc</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，由于全球变暖，登革热和基孔肯雅热可能很快在欧洲流行-法国24 | Dengue and chikungunya may soon be endemic in Europe due to global warming, research shows - France 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPaGNybVlOOVdlcURqSVFUOExQVTVYbTBZMXBKYmxVQkRKd19VZ0szeHdnTlVRekZlcXo1QTZJZWxDeUg2QjZiRVN5ajR6elA3VzhRWXFWaUplQUVnVHJLWnJid0loVDU1WEJqNkJaV2Q0a21VMUFGS0lzUEhYTG9FOF85RzYxdHZqaHhwaEpSODVTakxraHYwVDBEaUsxYVRVN0ZtbEQwMjJtSFVXcTZUSHg3dEp2RUs0MXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="a-loader-error__content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity costs the UK an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/everybody-active-every-day-a-framework-to-embed-physical-activity-into-daily-life"&gt;£7.4 billion each year&lt;/a&gt; – but more importantly, it costs lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's increasingly sedentary world, sitting too much is raising the risk of many serious diseases, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161435" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But could something as simple as walking offer real protection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the answer may be yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27183032/"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity can lower the risk of cancer. Now, &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/14/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Oxford add more weight to that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a large study involving over 85,000 people in the UK, the more steps you take each day, the lower your chances of developing up to 13 different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, participants wore activity trackers that measured both the amount and intensity of their daily movement. On average, researchers followed up with participants six years later. They found a clear pattern: more steps meant lower cancer risk, regardless of how fast those steps were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits began to appear at around 5,000 steps a day – anything below that didn't seem to offer much protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 7,000 steps, the risk of developing cancer dropped by 11%. At 9,000 steps, it dropped by 16%. Beyond 9,000 steps, the benefits levelled off. The difference in risk reduction became marginal, and varied slightly between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support the popular recommendation of aiming for 10,000 steps a day – not just for general health, but potentially for cancer prevention too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations also held up when results were adjusted for demographic, BMI and other lifestyle factors, such as smoking, suggesting that the observed changes in cancer risk were indeed down to the average number of daily steps a participant took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg" alt="Older women walking together outdoors." class="wp-image-161443 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Walking 5,000 to 9,000 steps per day can cut cancer risk. (Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step intensity was also analysed – essentially, how fast participants were walking. Researchers found that faster walking was linked with lower cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when total physical activity was taken into account, the speed of walking no longer made a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="161435" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; difference. In other words: it's the total amount of walking that counts, not how brisk it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, replacing sitting time with either light or moderate activity lowered cancer risk – but swapping light activity for moderate activity didn't offer additional benefits. So just moving more, at any pace, appears to be what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 13 specific cancers, including oesophageal, liver, lung, kidney, gastric, endometrial, myeloid leukaemia, myeloma, colon, head and neck, rectal, bladder and breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the six year follow-up period, around 3% of participants developed one of these cancers. The most common were colon, rectal, and lung cancers in men, and breast, colon, endometrial, and lung cancers in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher physical activity levels were most strongly linked to reduced risk of six cancers: gastric, bladder, liver, endometrial, lung and head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Break it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have relied on self-reported activity logs, which can be unreliable – people often forget or misjudge their activity levels. This study used wearable devices, providing a more accurate picture of how much and how intensely people were moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also stands out because it didn't focus solely on vigorous exercise. Many past studies have shown that intense workouts can reduce cancer risk – but not everyone is able (or willing) to hit the gym hard. This new research shows that even light activity like walking can make a difference, making cancer prevention more accessible to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking just two miles a day – roughly 4,000 steps, or about 40 minutes of light walking – could make a significant impact on your long-term health. You don't have to do it all at once either. Break it up throughout the day by: taking the stairs instead of the lift; having a stroll at lunchtime; walking during phone calls; parking a bit further away from your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting more steps into your routine, especially during middle age, could be one of the simplest ways to lower your risk of developing certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the link between physical activity and cancer is complex. More long-term research is needed, especially focused on individual cancer types, to better understand why walking helps – and how we can make movement a regular part of cancer prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, the message is clear: sit less, move more – and you could walk your way toward better health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They are commonly used for pain relievers, multivitamins, stool softeners, and cough and cold medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unknown how many Americans take such capsules, the US soft gel capsules market was valued at $2.14 billion in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top heart doctor has revealed the insidious chemical in medicine capsules that could increase your risk of a heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Phthalates [can] increase inflammation and an important risk for heart disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Environmental Pollution study found phthalate exposure was associated with a slightly higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the urine samples of 5,300 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 years old from 2001 to 2010 and tracked causes of death among.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed among the 100,000 people who died during the study period, the ones with higher levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to have died from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted further research is needed to understand the exact ink between phthalate exposure and heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Dr Levine, exposure to phthalates - especially through pills - can cause swelling and irritation in&lt;span&gt; the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can lead them to narrow or harden, potentially causing blockages or aneurysms - ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, forming plaques, along the artery walls, but excessive intake of phthalates can also lead to this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Softgel capsule shells are made of phthalates - making it easier for manufacturers to mold the capsules into their own desired shape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim the chemicals also cause oxidative stress, a type of cell and tissue damage caused by an imbalance of molecules in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to damage in the heart cells, which can impair their function and contribute to inflammation, as well harden artery walls - increasing the risk for a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, phthalates can negatively impact cholesterol levels and potentially increase levels of triglycerides - a type of fat known to cause heart attacks - and low-density lipoproteins in the organ - making a person more susceptible to strokes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While radon gas is known to cause lung cancer, an 18-year, 700-plus county &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969724064441?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Oregon State University found a link between exposure to radon gas and childhood leukemia rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Imperial College London and the Environmental Protection Agency, found the link even at radon concentrations lower than the Environmental Protection Agency's mitigation threshold. Counties in Utah were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3,000 children receive a leukemia diagnosis per year in the U.S. There hasn't been a study on risk factors for cancer among children and the role the environment plays. Lead epidemiologist Matthew Bozigar from Oregon State University wanted to see if radon exposure could be one of the risk factors for childhood leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are working on many different radon studies, and we are continuing to find harmful effects not limited to the lungs in adults." &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Matthew Bozigar, Oregon State University epidemiologist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an epidemiologist, I started considering possible environmental causes and connected with awesome collaborators who provided important data and other resources to enable innovative new analyses," Bozigar explained to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240930212851.htm" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that children who were exposed to a radon concentration of 2.0 pCi/L or higher had an 8 percent higher risk of leukemia for both males and females and a 12 percent higher risk for females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put that in perspective, the average indoor radon concentration in Utah is 4.5 pCi/L, two and a half times higher than the study's concentration threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon is odorless and colorless, the only way to detect it is to test for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the U.S. Surgeon General, the Environmental Protection Agency and many others encourage every homeowner to test regularly (typically every two years). UtahRadon.org is offering one &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0#radon-test-form" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;free test kit &lt;/a&gt;for each Utah household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Children who were exposed to a radon concentration of 2.0 pCi/L or higher had an 8% higher risk of leukemia for both males and females and a 12% higher risk for females. (Photo: PeopleImages)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More studies to come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study shows a statistically significant link between radon exposure and childhood leukemia, Bozigar said it's only a start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study design only allows us to identify statistical associations and to raise hypotheses, so studies that can better determine whether radon exposure causes childhood leukemia are needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Bozigar said, "We are working on many different radon studies, and we are continuing to find harmful effects not limited to the lungs in adults. We will have more to share in the coming months and years as our studies are published."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is a radioactive gas that can't be seen, smelled, or tasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is created when uranium in the ground decays and Utah has high levels of uranium around the state. One in three Utah homes has dangerous radon levels — and those numbers may be undercounted due to infrequent testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The second leading cause of lung cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon causes 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year — and thousands more diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon goes undetected by our senses and because lung cancer symptoms are often initially mild, most people do not get diagnosed until the disease has significantly progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do to protect your loved ones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon-induced lung cancer can almost entirely be avoided if Utahns are proactive in testing for radon in their homes. Leading health organizations recommend testing for radon every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org &lt;/a&gt;makes testing your home easy and provides &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0#radon-test-form" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;one free test for every Utah home&lt;/a&gt;. The test kit includes shipping, the test, lab fees, and the analysis. There is no cost to test your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

			&lt;p&gt;The setup for &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; video game and TV series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLNagvJHl3g"&gt;involves a fungus&lt;/a&gt; that evolves due to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="160766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; to infect swathes of the human population, turning people into killer zombies – and at least part of that story is eerily plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are raising concerns about the increasing spread of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt; fungi&lt;/a&gt;, helped along by climate change and warmer temperatures. These types of fungus don't turn people into zombies, but they can cause severe health issues and even fatalities in people, plants, and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, researchers in the UK show how three species – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_flavus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – are likely to spread further north between now and 2100, based on their existing habitats and climate models predicting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-map-reveals-the-predicted-future-climate-where-you-live"&gt;future warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160769" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160769" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps.jpg" alt="Fungi spread" class="wp-image-160769 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps-617x415.jpg 617w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps-600x404.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160769" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers modeled the spread of the fungus worldwide. (van Rhijn et al., &lt;em&gt;Research Square&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in environmental factors, such as humidity and extreme weather events, will change habitats and drive fungal adaptation and spread," &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/climate-change-putting-millions-more-people-at-risk-from-infection-causing-fungi/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; environmental mycologist Norman van Rhijn, from the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="160766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the severe climate scenario, the spread of &lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt; in Europe could increase by 77.5 percent in 15 years, putting 9 million more people at risk of infection. For &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt;, which favors hotter areas, the spread might be as much as 16 percent in Europe, putting an extra 1 million people at risk. For &lt;em&gt;A. niger&lt;/em&gt;, the data showed a more stable picture across the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nuanced issue though: as the fungi spread to areas that were previously too cold, they're also likely to be driven out of regions that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exceptional-ongoing-global-heat-streak-defies-climate-predictions"&gt;get too hot&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the number of people exposed to these types of fungus will decline by 2100, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's the spread to new areas – and potentially vulnerable people, especially those with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-fungus-grows-a-poisonous-sword-to-free-itself-from-immune-cells"&gt;weakened immune systems&lt;/a&gt; – that the researchers are worried about. There's the possibility we'll also see more infections in healthy individuals as these species adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just human infections we need to worry about, the team says. Fungal outbreaks can decimate crops, adding to the growing challenges of feeding the world's population under climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The potential for increased human exposure in Asia and Europe, combined with contraction in parts of Africa and South America, could alter public health burdens and crop biosecurity landscapes over time," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6545782/v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, the fungus &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_auris"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been of concern to scientists. Capable of causing significant health problems, it too has been spreading further &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2022.100250"&gt;as the world warms up&lt;/a&gt;, and other species are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is the flip side of these fungi: the benefits they bring to ecosystems, including carbon and nutrient recycling. This all needs considering when weighing up the shifts being caused by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Raising awareness and developing effective interventions for fungal pathogens will be essential to mitigate the consequences of this," &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/climate-change-putting-millions-more-people-at-risk-from-infection-causing-fungi/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; van Rhijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available at the preprint platform &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6545782/v1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research Square&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many different ways coffee may interact with some medications. “Coffee can alter how certain medications are absorbed, metabolized or eliminated by the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjenbourgeois/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jennifer Bourgeois, Pharm.D&lt;/a&gt;. “It can speed up gastric emptying, causing the medication to move through your system before it’s fully absorbed. It also competes with medications that rely on liver enzymes like CYP1A2, potentially increasing or decreasing drug levels in the bloodstream.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you have to give up coffee completely, but you may need to adjust the timing of taking your medications and sipping on your coffee. Read on to find out which medications an expert warns may interact with your morning cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-antidepressants"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Antidepressants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your doctor has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902827/foods-to-eat-for-better-mental-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prescribed an antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll want to make sure you aren’t drinking coffee too soon after taking one of these medications because it can make them not work as well as they’re supposed to. For example, the caffeine in coffee can form a complex with the antidepressant drug escitalopram (Lexapro), making it harder for your body to absorb the medication. Since less of the drug is absorbed, it may be less effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other antidepressants like clomipramine and imipramine are broken down by the same enzyme (called CYP1A2) as caffeine. So if you’re taking these medications with coffee, they may not be metabolized as quickly, which can lead to higher levels of the drug in your blood for a longer period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, this interaction could increase the effects of caffeine, leaving you feeling jittery and restless. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-thyroid-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Thyroid Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck) doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Without adequate hormone levels, you may start to experience excessive tiredness, joint and muscle pain, depression or weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bourgeois explains that the absorption of levothyroxine, used to treat hypothyroidism, can be significantly reduced by coffee. In fact, some studies found that it reduces your absorption of the medication by as much as 50%. “This may lead to inconsistent thyroid levels and persistent symptoms like fatigue or brain fog,” says Bourgeois. “That’s why patients are advised to wait 30 to 60 minutes before drinking coffee after taking thyroid medications.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-osteoporosis-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Osteoporosis Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications used to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;treat osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, like risedronate and alendronate, shouldn’t be taken with coffee. “Whether it’s caffeinated, decaf or even just milk or juice, these can all reduce absorption due to how the medication binds and dissolves. The safest practice is always to take this medication with plain water only,” says Bourgeois.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

Cold &amp;amp; Allergy Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is a nasal decongestant that can be purchased over the counter to help treat a stuffy nose from the common cold or allergies. Like caffeine, pseudoephedrine is also a stimulant. So when taken together with coffee, it may compound the side effects, making you feel more jittery and restless.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Those with diabetes should be extra cautious when consuming caffeine on this medication—some studies found that combining the two can raise blood sugar and increase body temperature.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-antipsychotic-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Antipsychotic Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who take antipsychotic medications like phenothiazine, clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine may need to adjust the timing of their morning coffee. Coffee can interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, clozapine competes with coffee to be broken down by liver enzymes. If the medication can’t be metabolized, it becomes less efficient. A study found that the plasma concentration of clozapine was increased by 97% after taking it with 2 to 3 cups of coffee (about 400 milligrams of caffeine). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have asthma, a condition that can make your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826579/healthy-lungs-food/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;airways inflamed and irritated&lt;/a&gt;, your health care provider may prescribe a bronchodilator like aminophylline or theophylline. These medications relax the muscles in your airways, making it easier to breathe. Common side effects of this medication include nausea, headache, restlessness and irritability. Consuming too much caffeine (from coffee, tea or energy drinks) can increase the side effects you may experience while taking this medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood-thinning medications are often recommended for those who may be at risk for blood clots after surgery or have certain heart or blood conditions. Since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blood-thinners-and-leafy-greens-8584000" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;these medications&lt;/a&gt; prevent blood from clotting, the most common side effect is the risk of bleeding. Taking these medications with coffee is risky since the caffeine in coffee can also slow blood clotting, which further increases your risk of bleeding or bruising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, research has found that coffee can lower the pH in your stomach, which can increase the absorption time of other blood thinners like aspirin. Since it’s absorbed faster, more is available to the body all at once, which can enhance the potential for bleeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us look forward to sipping on that first cup of coffee in the morning. While coffee is associated with plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-health-benefit-of-coffee-study-11726744" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth double-checking that it isn’t interfering with any of your medications. Reviewing this list is a good place to start. If you’re on one of these medications, you may need to adjust the timing of your coffee and medications. However, if you have specific questions about potential food or beverage interactions with your medications, be sure to check in with your health care provider.&lt;br&gt;

Participants solving visual puzzles were more likely to recall solutions that came to them in a flash of insight than those they reached methodically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights activated the hippocampus and reorganized neural patterns in visual recognition areas, strengthening memory traces. The findings support educational strategies that foster discovery-based learning to promote retention and deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Eureka moments nearly double the likelihood of remembering information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights trigger hippocampal activity and reorganize visual memory circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Inquiry-based learning may enhance long-term retention through insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Duke University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever been stuck on a problem, puzzling over something for what felt like ages without getting anywhere, but then suddenly the answer came to you like a bolt from the blue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all experienced that “aha! moment,” that sudden clarity or magical epiphany you feel when a new idea or perspective pops into your head as if out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new evidence from brain imaging research shows that these flashes of insight aren’t just satisfying — they actually reshape how your brain represents information, and help sear it into memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109930"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a lightbulb." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/insights-eureka-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The current study looked at brain activity at two specific moments in time, before and after the eureka moment when the lightbulb appeared. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers at Duke University and Humboldt and Hamburg Universities in Germany, the work has implications for education, suggesting that fostering “eureka moments” could help make learning last beyond the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an aha experience when solving something, “you’re actually more likely to remember the solution,” said first author Maxi Becker, a postdoctoral fellow at Humboldt University in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published May 9 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record people’s brain activity while they tried to solve visual brain teasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puzzles required them to “fill in the blanks” of a series of two-tone images with minimal detail, using their perception to complete the picture and identify a real-world object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such hidden picture puzzles serve as small-scale proxies for bigger eureka moments. “It’s just a little discovery that you are making, but it produces the same type of characteristics that exist in more important insight events,” said senior author Roberto Cabeza, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each puzzle the participants thought they solved, the researchers asked whether the solution just popped into their awareness in a flash of sudden insight, or whether they worked it out in a more deliberate and methodical way, and how certain they were of their answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants tended to recall solutions that came to them in a flash of insight far better than ones they arrived at without this sense of epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the more conviction a person felt about their insight at the time, the more likely they were to remember it five days later when the researchers asked them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have an ‘aha! moment’ while learning something, it almost doubles your memory,” said Cabeza, who has been studying memory for 30 years. “There are few memory effects that are as powerful as this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of changes in the brain may cause people to have better memory for “aha! moments,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that flashes of insight trigger a burst of activity in the brain’s hippocampus, a cashew-shaped structure buried deep in the temporal lobe that plays a major role in learning and memory. The more powerful the insight, the greater the boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that the activation patterns across the participants’ neurons changed once they spotted the hidden object and saw the image in a new light — particularly in certain parts of the brain’s ventral occipito-temporal cortex, the region responsible for recognizing visual patterns. The stronger the epiphany, the greater the change in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During these moments of insight, the brain reorganizes how it sees the image,” said Becker, who did the work in the Cabeza lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, stronger “aha!” experiences were associated with greater connectivity between these different brain regions. “The different regions essentially communicate with each other more efficiently,” Cabeza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study looked at brain activity at two specific moments in time, before and after the eureka moment when the lightbulb appeared. As a next step, the researchers plan to look more closely at what happens during the few seconds in between that allows people to finally see the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insight is key for creativity,” Cabeza said. In addition to shedding light on how the brain comes up with creative solutions, the findings also lend support for inquiry-based learning in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Learning environments that encourage insight could boost long-term memory and understanding,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the Einstein Foundation Berlin (EPP-2017-423, RC) and by the Sonophilia Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea988b99dbdaaa8e9f818fc48f8e9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robin Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://duke.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robin Smith – Duke University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59355-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insight Predicts Subsequent Memory via Cortical Representational Change and Hippocampal Activity&lt;/a&gt;” by Maxi Becker et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight Predicts Subsequent Memory via Cortical Representational Change and Hippocampal Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanisms driving creative problem-solving, including representational change and its relation to memory, still remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focus on the creative process of insight, wherein rapid knowledge reorganization and integration—termed representational change—yield solutions that evoke suddenness, certainty, positive emotion, and enduring memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We posit that this process is associated with stronger shifts in activation patterns within brain regions housing solution-relevant information, including the visual cortex for visual problems, alongside regions linked to feelings of emotion, suddenness and subsequent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, we collect participants’ brain activity while they solve visual insight problems in the MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings substantiate these hypotheses, revealing stronger representational changes in visual cortex, coupled with activations in the amygdala and hippocampus—forming an interconnected network.

&lt;h2&gt;Small change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers identified the EspW mutation by comparing the genetic sequences of 729 isolates of the new &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strain—dubbed REPEXH01—to genetic sequences of 2,027 other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 isolates. Of the 729 REPEXH01 strains, all but two had a single nucleotide deletion in EspW (the remaining two had ambiguous sequences), while the deletion was present in less than 4 percent of the non-REPEXH01 &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains. The finding suggests the tiny change could be a genetic signature of the strain, and its persistence in a key disease protein may offer the strain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's unclear what that advantage might be. The deletion of a single DNA base (an adenine) shifts the frame of the three-sequence protein code for the rest of EspW. This could result in a shorter protein. It could also cause the molecular machinery that translates the genetic code to slip, leading to proteins of various lengths. In any case, the deletion is likely to result in a less fully functional EspW protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers suggest this could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;when it's on lettuce and other produce. For example, EspW might spur an immune response from an infected plant that causes stomata—pores on the surfaces of leaves—to close, blocking the bacteria's ability to invade. Thus, cutting back EspW may help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;sneak in—an adaptation in the ongoing arms race between the bacteria and its host. Another possibility is that EspW could function like HopW1, leading to more severe infection in plant tissues, which could lower the chances that those infected leaves are harvested and make it to grocery stores and atop burgers. Thus, cutting back on EspW could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; move to its human victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, additional research will be needed to understand what's going on. As the CDC researchers conclude: "the role of the single base pair mutation in this strain’s colonization and survival on leafy vegetables could yield valuable insights."&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/measles-case-confirmed-in-williamsburg/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants their child to get measles,” warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt; of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses—typically administered at ages 1 and 4—offer up to 97% protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
