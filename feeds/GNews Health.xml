							&lt;p data-start="260" data-end="303"&gt;Trends have a funny way of circling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="305" data-end="558"&gt;What your grandparents once did to pass the time is suddenly all over TikTok and Instagram. Some of these hobbies were seen as outdated, maybe even uncool for a while—but now they’re back in the spotlight, rebranded and thriving with a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="560" data-end="612"&gt;Let’s dive into seven of the most surprising ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="619" data-end="641"&gt;1. Vinyl collecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="643" data-end="847"&gt;There was a time when vinyl was considered dead. CDs were the future, then MP3s, then streaming. But here we are again, flipping through records at local shops or digging through crates at flea markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="849" data-end="1041"&gt;For boomers, records were everyday items—just how you listened to music. For Gen Z, it’s about slowing down, owning something tangible, and celebrating music in a way that feels intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1043" data-end="1340"&gt;As Jack White once said, “Vinyl is the purest form of music you can get.” It’s less about convenience and more about ritual: sliding the record out, placing it on the turntable, and letting the needle drop. That kind of physical connection with music is something streaming just can’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1342" data-end="1641"&gt;There’s also the social side. Record fairs and independent stores have become gathering places again, not unlike the way boomers once swapped LPs with friends. I’ve been to shows where the merch table includes limited-run vinyl pressings, and it’s clear the appeal isn’t nostalgia—it’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1643" data-end="1920"&gt;It’s more than nostalgia, too. Neuroscience shows that music strongly &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/music-emotional-memory-28964/?.com"&gt;engages the amygdala and hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;—areas essential to emotional memory. That helps explain why a scratched Fleetwood Mac LP your parents played still hits differently than the same track streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1927" data-end="1949"&gt;2. Film photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1951" data-end="2100"&gt;I still remember the first time I developed photos in a darkroom back in high school. It felt like magic watching the image slowly appear on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2102" data-end="2382"&gt;For a long time, digital cameras and then smartphones made film feel unnecessary. But Gen Z is bringing it back with gusto. They’re buying vintage cameras, experimenting with expired rolls of film, and posting grainy snapshots that feel more authentic than polished iPhone pics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2384" data-end="2602"&gt;It’s not about getting the “perfect” shot—it’s about embracing imperfection, waiting to see the results, and valuing the surprise. There’s something deeply human about not being able to delete a bad photo right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2604" data-end="2798"&gt;As Susan Sontag once wrote, “All photographs are memento mori.” Gen Z seems to understand that intuitively. A film photo isn’t just an image; it’s proof of a moment, locked into physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2800" data-end="3020"&gt;The patience involved matters too. In a world of instant gratification, waiting for film to develop introduces anticipation—something psychologists link to higher dopamine release when the final result finally arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3027" data-end="3056"&gt;3. Thrifting and upcycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3058" data-end="3159"&gt;Thrift stores used to be where boomers went out of necessity. Now they’re treasure hunts for Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3161" data-end="3416"&gt;This generation has made secondhand cool again—not just for affordability but also for sustainability. They’re not just shopping thrift; they’re flipping clothes, repurposing furniture, and upcycling in ways that would make a 1970s DIY enthusiast proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3418" data-end="3639"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but the psychology of ownership changes when you’ve invested time in transforming something. That jacket you re-dyed or that chair you refinished? It’s not just yours—it’s part of your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3641" data-end="3870"&gt;Economists call this the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect?.com"&gt;“IKEA effect”&lt;/a&gt;—the tendency for people to overvalue things they’ve put effort into creating. Gen Z is applying that principle at scale, mixing fashion with identity and creativity with eco-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3872" data-end="4060"&gt;And unlike boomers, they’re sharing the process online. TikToks of thrift flips regularly get millions of views, proving that the creativity is just as important as the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4067" data-end="4082"&gt;4. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4084" data-end="4253"&gt;Boomers grew up with backyard gardens partly out of practicality. Food prices were lower when you grew it yourself, and homegrown tomatoes always tasted better anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Gen Z is rediscovering gardening too—but often for entirely different reasons. Beyond food, it’s become a mental-health ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Experimental research in the &lt;em data-start="157" data-end="187"&gt;Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found that just 30 minutes of gardening led to significantly &lt;a href="https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/gardening-promotes-neuroendocrine-and-affective-restoration-from-?.com"&gt;stronger reductions in cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (the stress hormone) and a full restoration of positive mood compared to indoor reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4521" data-end="4721"&gt;Balcony gardens, indoor herb pots, even TikToks of “cottagecore” aesthetics—all point back to something boomers did without giving it much thought: connecting to the earth and growing your own food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4723" data-end="4986"&gt;When I was traveling through Japan a few years ago, I noticed how many people maintained tiny balcony gardens in dense cities. That image stuck with me, and it’s the same trend I now see online: Gen Z carving out little sanctuaries of green in urban apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4988" data-end="5163"&gt;The beauty of this trend is that it’s not only grounding (literally), but it also taps into a sense of self-sufficiency that’s psychologically reassuring in uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5170" data-end="5199"&gt;5. Knitting and crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5201" data-end="5304"&gt;Once dismissed as something only grandmothers did, knitting and crocheting are back with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5306" data-end="5523"&gt;Scroll through Etsy or Instagram and you’ll see handmade sweaters, funky hats, and creative designs that look nothing like the beige scarves of the past. Gen Z isn’t just following patterns—they’re reinventing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5788"&gt;I picked up knitting while traveling through Iceland years ago, and there’s a kind of meditative flow to it. Loop by loop, row by row, you’re literally creating something from nothing. For a generation bombarded by screens, that slowness is a form of rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5790" data-end="6067"&gt;Clinical psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who coined the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi?.com"&gt;“flow,”&lt;/a&gt; once noted that people feel happiest when fully absorbed in an activity that challenges them just enough. Knitting is a perfect example—it’s simple but demands focus, and the payoff is tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6258"&gt;Even better, the community aspect is alive again. Online forums, TikTok “stitch clubs,” and in-person meetups have turned what was once a solitary activity into a vibrant social movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6265" data-end="6278"&gt;6. Bowling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6280" data-end="6456"&gt;Bowling alleys used to be the quintessential Friday night outing for boomers. Then they went through a bit of a decline—replaced by multiplexes, malls, and later video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6458" data-end="6663"&gt;But now? Bowling is making a comeback. Retro aesthetics, neon-lit alleys, and even boutique “luxury” bowling venues have captured Gen Z’s attention. It’s social, it’s silly, and it’s refreshingly analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6665" data-end="6971"&gt;Psychologists note that &lt;a href="https://realitypathing.com/why-do-group-activities-enhance-social-connections/?.com"&gt;group activities&lt;/a&gt; grounded in shared goals—like trying to knock down pins together—forge powerful bonds. Participating in light‑hearted, collective challenges like bowling encourages emotional cohesion and connection, especially in a generation that prioritizes experience over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7264"&gt;I was reminded of this on a trip to Portland, where a friend dragged me to a vintage-style bowling alley complete with old-school scoring sheets and craft beer. The vibe wasn’t competitive—it was collaborative, goofy, and strangely wholesome. Exactly the sort of night Gen Z is hungry for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7271" data-end="7287"&gt;7. Book clubs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7289" data-end="7517"&gt;Boomers joined book clubs to socialize, exchange ideas, and maybe drink a little wine. Gen Z is picking up that same tradition, only now it’s mixed with online communities, Discord servers, and TikTok’s famous “BookTok” trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7519" data-end="7824"&gt;I’ve seen twenty-somethings organize meetups around classics like &lt;em data-start="7585" data-end="7606"&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and contemporary works like Colleen Hoover novels. It’s less about academic analysis and more about connection—sharing emotional takeaways, swapping recommendations, and using books as a bridge to real conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="8051"&gt;As noted by author Zadie Smith, “The very reason I read is so I can live more than one life in more than one place.” Gen Z has tapped into that sentiment in a big way, turning reading into both a personal and social ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8053" data-end="8255"&gt;It’s also a reaction to digital fatigue. Reading, by its nature, forces you to focus on one narrative. When paired with a club or discussion, it satisfies two cravings at once: solitude and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8262" data-end="8280"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8282" data-end="8308"&gt;What’s old is new again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8310" data-end="8459"&gt;Gen Z isn’t simply copying boomer hobbies; they’re reimagining them through their own lens—sustainability, mindfulness, creativity, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8461" data-end="8570"&gt;It’s a reminder that trends don’t really disappear. They just wait for the right moment to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8572" data-end="8686"&gt;So maybe the next time you’re tempted to dismiss something as “outdated,” ask yourself: is it actually timeless?&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="398" data-end="588"&gt;We live in a time where wellness has become a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="398" data-end="588"&gt;People love to talk about their morning routines, their special diets, their productivity hacks—all in the name of “health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="590" data-end="818"&gt;But here’s the catch: not everything that gets paraded around as healthy actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="590" data-end="818"&gt;Some habits people brag about are quietly draining their energy, messing with their mental health, or even putting stress on their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="820" data-end="1020"&gt;I’ve noticed this pattern over the years: the more someone insists they’ve “hacked” their way to peak wellness, the more likely it is that at least one part of their routine is working against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1022" data-end="1068"&gt;Let’s dig into seven of those sneaky habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1075" data-end="1112"&gt;1. Waking up at 4 a.m. every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1114" data-end="1263"&gt;You’ve probably heard someone brag about how they wake up before the sun, crush a workout, journal, meditate, and still answer emails before 7 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1265" data-end="1400"&gt;Sounds impressive, right? Except… if you’re not getting enough sleep, the “early riser” routine is hurting you more than helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1402" data-end="1638"&gt;Sleep deprivation impairs memory, increases stress hormones, and over time, can lead to burnout. The National Sleep Foundation notes that adults need &lt;a href="https://www.thensf.org/sleep-facts-and-statistics/?.com"&gt;7–9 hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt;, yet many people sacrificing sleep for productivity get far less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1640" data-end="1904"&gt;I once tried joining the “4 a.m. club.” For the first week, I felt like I was winning at life. By week two, I was cranky, scattered, and reaching for more caffeine just to function. The productivity I thought I was gaining was canceled out by constant brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1906" data-end="2115"&gt;The bragging point shouldn’t be how early you get up—it should be how well you’re supporting your body’s natural rhythms. If you’re a night owl, forcing a 4 a.m. wake-up might just leave you feeling wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2122" data-end="2162"&gt;2. Intermittent fasting to extremes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2164" data-end="2272"&gt;Fasting can have benefits. That’s true. But what often gets overlooked is how many people take it too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2274" data-end="2429"&gt;I once knew someone who bragged about only eating one meal a day. Sure, they lost weight, but they were constantly irritable, low-energy, and often sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2431" data-end="2582"&gt;The body needs consistent nourishment. Skipping meals to the point where you feel lightheaded or anxious isn’t discipline—it’s stress on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2584" data-end="2739"&gt;As nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert has said, “There’s a difference between mindful fasting and restrictive eating patterns that damage both body and mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2741" data-end="3076"&gt;Here’s the bigger issue: when fasting turns into a competition, it starts to look a lot like disordered eating. If you’re bragging about how long you can go without food, you’re missing the point of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2741" data-end="3076"&gt;Balance is key. Eating at regular intervals that match your energy needs will serve you better than any extreme eating window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3083" data-end="3130"&gt;3. Pushing through workouts when exhausted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3132" data-end="3271"&gt;There’s this “no excuses” culture around fitness, where people brag about never missing a workout, even when sick or completely depleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3273" data-end="3389"&gt;But exercise is a stressor. It can build resilience when you’re healthy—but when you’re run-down, it can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3391" data-end="3617"&gt;I fell into this trap during marathon training. One winter, I caught the flu and still went for a “short” run because I didn’t want to mess up my schedule. The result? A two-week setback that undid all the progress I’d made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3619" data-end="3820"&gt;Listening to your body isn’t laziness. It’s wisdom. Rest days are where the actual growth and repair happen. Skipping a workout when your body truly needs it doesn’t make you weak—it makes you smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3827" data-end="3857"&gt;4. Living on black coffee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3859" data-end="3999"&gt;Some people proudly announce they “run on caffeine.” They skip breakfast, load up on coffee, and treat jittery energy as a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4001" data-end="4154"&gt;But caffeine isn’t fuel—it’s a stimulant. Too much can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep cycles, and even deplete magnesium levels, which worsens stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4156" data-end="4304"&gt;Experts at the Sleep Foundation have noted that &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/caffeine-and-sleep?.com"&gt;consuming caffeine too frequently&lt;/a&gt; can trick your body into masking fatigue rather than solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4306" data-end="4598"&gt;I’ve been guilty of this too. In my finance days, I’d brag about how many cups of coffee I could down before noon. But the truth was, I was constantly wired and exhausted at the same time. I didn’t need more caffeine—I needed more rest, better food, and clearer boundaries with my workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4735"&gt;Coffee in moderation? Great. But bragging about surviving on coffee alone? That’s a recipe for adrenal fatigue and emotional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4742" data-end="4767"&gt;5. Always being “on”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4769" data-end="4945"&gt;This one often hides under the label of “productivity.” People brag about answering emails late at night, being on call 24/7, or skipping breaks because they’re so dedicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4947" data-end="5149"&gt;But our brains aren’t designed for nonstop output. Research from Stanford shows that productivity sharply &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/escaping-the-infinite-workday-trap-11773137?.com"&gt;declines after 50 hours of work&lt;/a&gt; in a week—and longer hours lead to errors, not better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5151" data-end="5422"&gt;I used to think working through lunch made me efficient. In reality, it just made me more likely to hit an afternoon slump. When I started taking short breaks—a walk outside, a quick stretch, even five minutes of silence—I noticed my energy and focus actually improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5424" data-end="5530"&gt;The healthiest people aren’t the ones glued to their laptops—they’re the ones who know how to step away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5537" data-end="5563"&gt;6. Over-supplementing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5565" data-end="5726"&gt;Some people take a dozen different pills every morning and proudly line them up like trophies. Vitamins, powders, “biohacking” formulas—it can look impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5728" data-end="5892"&gt;But here’s the truth: more isn’t always better. Over-supplementing can tax your liver and kidneys, throw off nutrient balance, and in some cases, even cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5894" data-end="6018"&gt;For example, too much vitamin D can lead to calcium buildup. Excess iron can cause organ damage. These aren’t small risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6020" data-end="6166"&gt;Supplements should fill in gaps, not replace a balanced diet. As dietitian Abby Langer puts it, “Supplements should supplement, not substitute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6168" data-end="6478"&gt;I learned this the hard way in my early wellness days. I bought into every trending powder and capsule I saw on Instagram. But after a round of blood work, my doctor told me some of my levels were actually too high. All that money and effort hadn’t made me healthier—it had just made things more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6480" data-end="6619"&gt;If you’re bragging about how many capsules you swallow daily, it might be worth rethinking whether that’s health—or just expensive urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6626" data-end="6652"&gt;7. Forcing positivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6654" data-end="6866"&gt;This one’s a little different, but it shows up a lot in wellness spaces. People brag about how they “never let anything get them down,” how they’re always upbeat, always grateful, always manifesting good vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6868" data-end="6926"&gt;But constant positivity isn’t resilience—it’s avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6928" data-end="7151"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/toxic-positivity?.com"&gt;Toxic positivity&lt;/a&gt;, as psychologists call it, can actually shut down real emotional processing. When you force yourself to only see the bright side, you ignore the necessary work of feeling, grieving, or setting boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7153" data-end="7333"&gt;I’ve seen friends push away their own pain in the name of being “spiritual” or “high vibe.” Eventually, it catches up with them in the form of burnout, anxiety, or disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7335" data-end="7592"&gt;True wellness isn’t about never having negative emotions. It’s about holding space for the full spectrum of being human. Some of the healthiest conversations I’ve ever had started with the words, “I’m not okay right now.” That’s not weakness—it’s honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7599" data-end="7618"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7620" data-end="7723"&gt;The funny thing is, the wellness habits people brag about are often the ones quietly sabotaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7725" data-end="7912"&gt;Health isn’t about extremes, rigid rules, or being the most disciplined person in the room. It’s about balance, sustainability, and actually feeling good—not just looking good on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7914" data-end="8134"&gt;So the next time you hear someone bragging about their 4 a.m. wake-ups, their one-meal-a-day routine, or their endless hustle, pause and ask yourself: does this actually sound healthy, or does it just sound exhausting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8136" data-end="8231"&gt;Your body—and your mind—will thank you for choosing the quieter, gentler version of wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

A large, long-term study has found a link between consuming low- and no-calorie sweeteners and cognitive decline, especially in people under 60 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-912801" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" target="_blank"&gt;first-of-its-kind study&lt;/a&gt; adds to the body of research suggesting that artificial sweeteners may come with health consequences — but they also have some benefits, such as being lower in calories, reducing risk of cavities and aiding in blood sugar management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2190a" class="body-graf"&gt;So what does the new research mean if you regularly consume artificial sweeteners? Here's what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-023ae1" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Sweeteners Were Linked to Cognitive Decline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-899ced" class="body-graf"&gt;The study followed over 12,000 middle-aged Brazilian adults for eight years, measuring their dietary intake of seven common sweeteners using self-reporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-c3e8d6" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspartame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saccharin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acesulfame-K&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erythritol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorbitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xylitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tagatose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51279b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We used the sweeteners that were available in Brazil at the time (of enrollment),” Dr. Claudia Suemoto, associate professor of geriatrics at the University of Sao Paulo and one of the study authors, tells TODAY.com via email. “Unfortunately, some sweeteners, like sucralose and stevia, were not available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d98be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers found that higher intake of the seven sweeteners was significantly associated with declines in global cognition and verbal fluency based on several different cognitive tests. The results were similar among all participants, but the link between low- and no-calorie sweeteners and memory decline was strongest in people with diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06c3f0" class="body-graf"&gt;Interestingly, the impact was greater in adults under 60 years old, while no significant associations were seen in those over 60. That suggests dietary habits in midlife, decades before dementia symptoms may appear, could have lifelong consequences for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca4043" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is important to remember that cognitive performance peaks around the third decade of life, between 25 and 30 years old, and after that there is a very slow, gradual decline in function. What our study shows is that sweetener consumption may accelerate this natural process, even in middle-aged adults,” says Suemoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-843f76" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers suspect that artificial sweeteners may influence the brain through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration or disruption of the gut–brain axis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13c235" class="body-graf"&gt;“Animal studies, for example, suggest that aspartame can trigger inflammation in the brain, while sugar alcohols like erythritol and sorbitol may alter gut microbes and compromise the blood–brain barrier,” says Suemoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a10fe" class="body-graf"&gt;However, these studies use very large doses of sweeteners, beyond what most people consume in a day. So while the results probably do not translate to the smaller doses in beverages and other foods, "more research is needed both in animal models and mostly in humans," Suemoto explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2689c7" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should You Avoid Artificial Sweeteners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f6ef19" class="body-graf"&gt;While this is the first large cohort study to demonstrate an association between artificial sweeteners and cognitive decline, Suemoto emphasizes that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63f7ad" class="body-graf"&gt;For example, other studies could look at objective measurements of how much artificial sweetener participants were exposed to and images of the brain to see which parts may be most affected, she adds. Another approach would be to conduct a randomized study where participants either reduce or completely replace artificial sweeteners in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6ea39" class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're looking for guidance based the data currently available, Suemoto says moderation is key: “It is wise to limit consumption as much as possible, ideally avoiding daily use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9f8b3" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Food &amp;amp;

Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/20/stroke-and-dementia-risk-linked-to-low-sugar-drinks-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies have suggested&lt;/a&gt; they may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They looked at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants – 12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘No place in children’s hands’: under-16s in England to be banned from buying energy drinks","elementId":"0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60.

The average age of participants was 33, and 66% were women.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the trial, all participants, healthy adults from 18 to 65, showed no signs of an acute infection, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three times as many people in the control group contracted COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period 2.2% (5) of the participants in the azelastine group became infected with SARS-CoV-2 as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but in the placebo group, it was 6.7% (15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That translates to a 69% lower rate of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.31; 85% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.87).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who did get COVID-19 infections, azelastine demonstrated an increase in mean time to infection (31.2 days vs 19.5 days in the placebo group), and a reduction of the overall number of PCR-confirmed symptomatic infections (21 of treated 227 participants compared to 49 of 223 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azelastine also significantly reduced rhinovirus infections in the treatment group. During the 56-day follow up, 1.8% developed a rhinovirus infection in the treatment group, compared to 6.3% in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse events were comparable in the two groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that azelastine may provide meaningful protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a prophylactic setting," the authors wrote. "Data on the safety and effectiveness of 2 sprays of azelastine, 0.1%, nasal spray per nostril twice daily for the treatment of moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis as well as the existence of azelastine, 0.15%, nasal spray formulations on the market support the safe use of this medicinal product for longer periods of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intervention targeting the nasal mucosa could prove particularly beneficial in settings where multiple respiratory viruses are cocirculating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2838339"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a commentary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the study in the same journal, Samuel Vidal, MD, PhD, and Dan Barouch, MD, PhD, both from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said the study was promising, but the drug needs more testing among adults with comorbidities. But in the face of ever-changing variants, and vaccines that target the changing virus spike proteins, targeting the nasal mucosa may be a way forward in combating COVID-19 during the cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This intervention targeting the nasal mucosa could prove particularly beneficial in settings where multiple respiratory viruses are cocirculating or if the pathogens are unknown," the two wrote. "Should the present data be confirmed in larger phase 3 efficacy trials, intranasal azelastine may have substantial clinical utility, given its ease of administration, low cost, and over-the-counter availability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

No other information was provided about the person who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Utah County Health Department confirmed five cases of West Nile virus in humans in the county. Of those five cases, four are neuroinvasive West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between the high number of positive mosquito pools and multiple human cases with symptoms, it is clear that West Nile virus is actively being detected across Utah County," said a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest cases come on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51361247" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;three other human cases&lt;/a&gt; of West Nile virus reported in Salt Lake and Cache counties in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Utah County Mosquito Abatement crews are conducting additional assessments and have begun applying "targeted treatments" in neighborhoods where the five cases were identified, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These enhanced efforts are intended to reduce mosquito populations and lower the risk of transmission," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department states that individuals over 60 and those with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness from West Nile, but anyone can contract the illness from the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent contracting West Nile, the Utah County Health Department advises people to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always use insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves, pants and socks at dawn and dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate standing water around the home, as mosquitoes can breed in just a few days in small containers, buckets, bird baths, flowerpots or clogged gutters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep doors and windows screened and repair any holes or tears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take extra caution if you are older or immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Two of those cases were neuroinvasive and the patients were hospitalized. One of those hospitalized passed away due to the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people who have been infected with West Nile Virus don't develop any symptoms, but it can cause mild to severe illness in some people," said Davis County Health Department spokesperson Trevor Warner in a media release. "It is estimated that less than 1% of people infected with West Nile Virus develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can result in debilitating long-term complications or death." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RELATED | Mosquito Infections in Utah:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said symptoms of a West Nile Virus infection typically appear within two to 14 days of a mosquito bite. Symptoms may include fever, headaches or body aches. More severe infections may include high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals over the age of 60 or people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness due to West Nile Virus, but Warner said anyone can become ill from the bite of an infected mosquito. It is currently unclear the age or condition of the individual who passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health has reported that as of Aug. 30, 2025, Utah has seen 16 reported cases of West Nile Virus. Of those 16, 13 developed into a neuroinvasive form of the virus and only the one patient in Davis County has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department urged anyone who believes they may have a West Nile Virus infection to contact their healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utahns are also encouraged to protect themselves from mosquito bites and infection by using mosquito repellent, wearing light-colored and loose-fitting long sleeves and pants after dusk, and, when possible, avoid prolonged outdoor activity at dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utahns can prevent bites by draining standing water in yards, keeping gutters clear of debris, and keep weeds and tall grass cut short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KMYU</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:04:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOR0JFcmI2cERIOV9pVXlfcnE0Ym91RTJoZGJteG9RSnhvNkY4ekRfOEhvTWQzbmNIUWFtY0RMRE52alRIc21tSnhsZ0tLOG4xVHVLZWpXb3p5dTBvUVktQm11NzJ5TWJoRFBzb1h6MlJlUlNlNzJtSHE1bDktMEk5UlhpQUVEVkxua2RneXplUlBXV2dWTW5iVW1xM2xLMVFmRGRQSGdLNTQ5Y3lIcHVJTGZyMm9LcTg</guid></item><item><title>现在，即使是狗也被告知要去素食主义者！兽医声称，植物性食品为猪提供与肉类饮食“相似的营养素” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15060639/DOGS-vegan-Plant-foods-nutrients-meat.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're usually found begging for a sausage or a bit of chicken from your dinner plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But giving your dog a chunk of meat – or even a bone to chew on – might soon be a thing of the past, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have discovered that &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-897d1f80-88a7-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; options for dogs sold in the UK provide similar nutrition to meat–based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they argue that plant–based meals can be a 'healthy and viable' alternative for our four–legged friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study found that plant–based diets, when properly formulated, can be a healthy and viable alternative to meat–based options', lead author Rebecca Brociek, from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nottingham/index.html" id="mol-897fb790-88a7-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;'s School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ideally the next step is long–term feeding studies, but as we begin to rethink pet nutrition, perhaps the alternative isn't only better for the planet, but also beneficial for our four–legged companions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As plant–based diets gain popularity in human nutrition, the pet food industry is following suit with vegan diets becoming increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could mean that instead of eating food made from chicken, lamb and beef, more dogs will soon be given meals consisting of sweet potato, carrot flakes and pea protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said that plant–based diets can be a reasonable alternative to traditional meat options (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs, like humans, are omnivores and require certain nutrients rather than specific ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the team analysed the nutritional profiles of 31 meat and plant–based dog foods available in the UK. This included the levels of proteins, individual amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and all B–vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, they found that plant–based diets, when properly formulated, can be a reasonable alternative to meat–based options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional composition of meat and plant–based foods for dogs were similar, except for iodine and B–vitamins, which were lower in plant–based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said adopting a vegan diet for canine companions can provide adequate nutrients, but that supplements should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many of us assume that dogs need meat to stay healthy, but in fact, what they really need are the right nutrients,' Ms Brociek added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What I found was surprising – these foods stacked up more closely to meat–based diets than expected, with all showing some nutritional gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With more studies on plant–based pet foods emerging every year, I'm excited to help move this conversation forward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Giving your dog a chunk of meat – or even a bone to chew on – might soon be a thing of the past, according to a new study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of self–declared vegans in the UK has rocketed in recent years, and quadrupled between 2014 and 2019, from 150,000 to 600,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328506"&gt;Plos One&lt;/a&gt;, reads: 'Veganism is increasingly becoming a popular dietary choice for many people, whether it be for health reasons or concerns for animal welfare and/or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Owners of companion animals, who identify as vegetarian or vegan, therefore face an ethical dilemma – should they feed animals to their animals?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It concludes: 'Adopting a plant–based dietary pattern for your companion canine can provide nutritional adequacy with respect to the majority of macro– and micronutrients, with the exception of iodine and B–vitamins, which could easily be supplemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-c664d480-88aa-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-2ef77710-009f-11e8-9256-2f90a6e0b8af" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5304177/SCIENTISTS-REVEAL-DOG-ENJOYS-SCARFING-ITS.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team of scientists from University of California at Davis surveyed thousands of dog owners to figure out why dogs are drawn to eating their own and other dogs' poo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it has nothing to do with breed, age, or training, they did discover that dogs are more likely to eat poop when there are multiple dogs in one home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs are also more likely to eat poop if they're considered 'greedy eaters.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, the impetus for the disgusting behaviour likely has something to do with their wolf ancestors, which ate fresh poop before it became infected with parasites as a way to clean up any droppings left around their dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Don't expect a pill to help prevent poop eating any time soon, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found that food additives and other techniques have no success at preventing dogs from scarfing down faeces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sitting on an open bowl offers no support for the pelvic floor. That puts pressure on veins in the rectum, making them swollen and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2948d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The longer you sit on the toilet, the worse it is for you,” said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institute for Gut-Brain Research Institute in Boston. Pasricha is also an author of the study, which was &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d81198" class="body-graf"&gt;And smartphones are designed to keep people fixated for as long as possible. “They’re completely consuming to us in ways that wasn’t happening to the casual bathroom reader in the 80s,” Pasricha said. “They could much more easily put the newspaper down and get up and leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9617e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and colleagues surveyed 125 adults just before they were about to have a routine colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52fe29" class="body-graf"&gt;Eighty-three (66%) of the participants admitted to using their phones in the bathroom — mostly to catch up on news of the day and scroll through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-525b28" class="body-graf"&gt;Gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopies looked for evidence of inflamed veins, or hemorrhoids. People who said they took their phone into the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to the others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d0d65" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk remained even when researchers accounted for other factors associated with hemorrhoids, including dietary fiber, exercise and constipation or straining while using the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf00d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Hemorrhoids aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they can be bothersome, itchy and even painful. They also bleed sometimes, understandably causing concern and leading to nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(18)30275-1/fulltext/" target="_blank"&gt;4 million doctor’s office and emergency department visits&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-294985" class="body-graf"&gt;Over time, “pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to incontinence, worsen constipation and be associated with rectal pain,” said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, an inflammatory bowel disorder specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Chowdhury was not involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc3395" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, microscopic particles from urine and feces are sent flying through the air when a toilet is flushed. Taking a phone into the bathroom, Chowdhury said, “is kind of gross.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a61c3" class="body-heading"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7c2ae" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, smartphone users in the bathroom tended to be younger, meaning adults in their 40s and 50s, versus people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca875c" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Cima, a colorectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he’s noticed an uptick in recent years of people coming in with hemorrhoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff0ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am seeing younger, earlier- and middle-aged people having more hemorrhoidal complaints, but I can’t tie it to smartphones,” said Cima, who was not involved with the new study. “Maybe it’s because they’re using smartphones or they have better access to care or they’re not eating appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b112d" class="body-heading"&gt;The 5-minute rule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-400844" class="body-graf"&gt;The experts agreed that business on the toilet should take no longer than 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-866a13" class="body-graf"&gt;More than 37% of study participants who used a smartphone in the bathroom stayed for longer than that, compared to 7% of people who kept their phones out of the bathroom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bffb" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and other experts do not advocate for taking a phone into the bathroom. If you absolutely must, set a timer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b09651" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If the magic is not happening within five minutes, it’s not going to happen,” Pasricha said. “Take a breather and try again later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMzJsdnMxT1haOU1IRWlMOVZJVTh3MjJTeDVHVFYtQVJaSG1Pb3l5eU14RWhoVkpVT2lwWWIwVmZmNVlLWk9KQ1NRbkhTYVlYbC1zRzY0OHRyUU5NMVNnMXJRbjY1YTROUzhHc2JoNE15bzdxWUdFUVdUeUtwRURkVndRUWZSOHRqUUphZ1Q3c1F5aFRGT2FINnRGXy1Md19EOEE4SzRycjdmWHPSAVZBVV95cUxPbGhFcDExa2NickRIVEoya1pTc3ZpeDZYdTVIUWdBanZRaWxZWWd1WWxKSzN2a2FlejZucmtYVXhocVJlWUlia1dXOVF0TE1aTHF2cXU2QQ</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，在大便时使用手机会大大增加痔疮的风险- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/toilet-time-hemorrhoid-risk-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            There’s nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one’s family, even just for a few minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000m3b6n534k5eyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000n3b6n01ob0u90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are consequences to sitting longer than we used to on the toilet: People are reporting a higher rate of hemorrhoids when they bring their smartphones to the bathroom, according to &lt;a href="http://plos.io/4mufrh" target="_blank"&gt;a new study in PLOS One.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000o3b6nxj2qx79w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids" target="_blank"&gt;Hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt; are groups of veins in the rectum and outside the anus that can swell and enlarge due to increased pressure, which can create itchiness, discomfort, pain and bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000p3b6ntmvzja6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study’s senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000q3b6nkxmrwzhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All this scrolling is messing with people’s health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000r3b6nfojltjku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The entire business model of these social media apps is to distract us, make us lose track of time and addict us to the algorithm,” Pasricha said. “We’re just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000s3b6n7jwwf14q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Confirmation of hemorrhoids was detected by endoscopy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000t3b6n6b3wwoj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000u3b6nwzle3qkx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. About 37% of smartphone users spend over five minutes on the toilet compared with 7% of non-smartphone users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000v3b6nebdgwnea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Over time, the increased pressure from the toilet seat can cause blood to pool in the rectum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000w3b6n4gi170u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re sitting on an open toilet bowl, you have no pelvic floor support,” Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000x3b6nb42hvdax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000y3b6nj3onxtqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn’t ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. The squatted position is a better option for a smooth bowel movement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000z3b6n2zrt1hxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we’re evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900103b6n5ija0pmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about constipation? The study results suggest the issue is most likely the time spent sitting on the toilet rather than straining, Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900113b6n42c023l2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who used their smartphones weren’t more constipated than those who didn’t, she said. “They didn’t actually strain harder to have a bowel movement than the ones who didn’t. My hypothesis is that it’s passive smartphone use that causes these hemorrhoidal cushions to become engorged and bulge, and that’s what leads to hemorrhoids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900123b6n4xamkbh6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900133b6nsa4ywk1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn’t use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900143b6n5vconroi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900153b6nv0i3giz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The simplest answer is to avoid bringing your phone to the bathroom. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Three to five minutes would be ideal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900163b6n9k78tnn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of expert consensus is three minutes per bowel movement, but everyone is different,” Shukla said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900173b6ngtoe82ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Setting a timer can be helpful if you’re prone to mindless scrolling. Pasricha also recommended checking in with yourself after two TikTok videos to see whether you’re having a productive toilet session. If the magic isn’t happening, it’s better to get up and try again later than to sit and wait on the toilet bowl.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900183b6nvm8jc1e1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghanta explained it best: There are many things in life we’re rushing to get through, and we often say to slow down and take time to smell the roses. But not on the toilet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="gt-block"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a victim of sleep disorder, you might be in luck—an expert may have solved the mystery of why you can't sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep scientists have long suggested banning technology before bed, avoiding caffeine, and sticking to a fixed schedule every night as three simple ways to combat insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, a sleep researcher at Royal Holloway University of London has claimed that these are not the most effective ways to get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Kirsty Vant, five common habits can make insomnia even worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep doesn't come, the temptation is to go to bed earlier or stay up longer in the morning to "compensate."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this strategy often backfires,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more time you spend awake in bed, the more you weaken the mental association between bed and sleep—and strengthen the association between bed and frustration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, people should go to bed a little later and wake up at the same time every morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This strengthens sleep pressure—the body’s natural desire for sleep—and reframes bed as a signal for sleep, not wakefulness,” she told The Conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867041" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg 798w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-437x300.jpg 437w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-184x126.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, scientists often advise avoiding screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a natural hormone that plays a key role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of lighting can create strong contrasts and shadows, which are tiring to the eyes, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, disrupting the natural calming process and contributing to physical and mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, “lying in the dark with nothing to engage your mind can create the perfect storm for anxiety and overthinking, both of which fuel insomnia,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of banning screens altogether, use them strategically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choose calming, non-stimulating content, use 'night mode' options, and avoid mindlessly scrolling through pages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if people are sensitive to caffeine, it is "wise" to avoid it later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Removing it completely “is not always necessary,” she advised. “Understanding your individual response is key.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a recent sleep survey, around one in nine women in the UK—approximately 4.5 million—use a sleep/health app or device, such as a smartwatch, to track their sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleep pattern is presented in the app with diagrams showing minutes spent in the three stages of sleep—light, deep, and REM—with warnings if users don't reach their target hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “overwhelming effort to optimize sleep” is fueling rising cases of insomnia and orthosomnia—the obsession with sleeping “right,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867042" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg 793w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-499x300.jpg 499w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-184x111.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Sleep is an autonomic function, like digestion or blood pressure. While we can influence sleep through healthy habits, we can't force it to happen. Obsessing over sleep quality can paradoxically worsen it," she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, the best approach is to worry less about sleep—and let your body do what it's designed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even expecting to sleep a fixed number of hours each night can increase the risk of insomnia, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Expecting rigid consistency from sleep creates unrealistic expectations. Some nights will be better than others—and that’s normal. Healthy sleep is not a fixed number of hours—it’s dynamic and responsive to our lives. Factors like stress, physical health, age, environment, even parental responsibilities all affect sleep,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insomnia is common and treatable—and no, it’s not your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People often need about 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep after turning off the lights, according to the Sleep Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, a study found that around one in six Britons suffer from insomnia, but 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey of 2,000 people, conducted by The Sleep Charity, found that nine out of ten people experience some kind of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behavior when they can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which is estimated to affect up to 14 million Britons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, sleep deprivation has its own consequences—from irritability and short-term lack of focus, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. /GazetaExpress/&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, some may even be bad for your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666667725001047" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Preventive Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found a clear link between eating an unhealthy plant-based diet and a key biomarker linked to having a heart attack. For the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 7,700 people who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). (Yes, that’s data from more than 20 years ago—but experts say the findings still apply.) All of the participants were at least 20 years old and had no history of heart disease at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study period, the participants reported what they ate over a 24-hour period and gave blood samples to allow the researchers to look for biomarkers of heart disease. The researchers discovered that people who followed a healthy plant-based diet had a 49% lower risk of having higher levels of cardiac troponin I. (Cardiac troponin I is a sign of cardiac muscle damage and is linked to heart attack risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Keatley, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Keatley, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., is co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy; Hosam Hmoud, M.D., cardiology fellow at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital; &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Wong, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Wong, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who followed an &lt;em&gt;unhealthy&lt;/em&gt; plant-based diet had a 65% higher risk of having elevated levels of cardiac troponin I, meaning they had a greater heart attack risk. “Supporting access to and adoption of healthy plant-based diets may be a useful strategy for promoting population-level cardiovascular health,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises a lot of questions about what qualifies as a “healthy” or “unhealthy” plant-based diet, plus the potential impact on your heart. Here’s what cardiologists and dietitians want you to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are certain plant-based foods bad for your heart?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to confuse “plant-based” with “healthy,” but they’re not the same thing, points out &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “The term ‘plant-based’ lacks a universal definition, which creates confusion for consumers,” she says. “Many food manufacturers and restaurants use ‘plant-based’ simply to indicate their products contain no animal ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a lack of animal products doesn’t automatically make a food healthy, Champion points out. &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Keatley, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Keatley, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy, agrees. “Not all plant-based foods are created equal,” he says. “A diet heavy in refined grains, fried foods, sugary beverages, and ultra-processed snacks may technically be ‘plant-based,’ but it lacks the protective compounds that whole fruits, vegetables, legumes, and intact grains provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unhealthy plant foods can spike your blood sugar, contribute to bodily inflammation, contain trans fats, and deliver excess calories without important nutrients, raising the risk of heart disease and other health issues, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that a vegan or vegetarian diet can absolutely be a heart-healthy diet, but eliminating animal products alone does not make a diet healthy,” Champion says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell when plant-based foods are unhealthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways to tell if a plant-based food is unhealthy, according to Keatley: the level of processing and the amount of sodium and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The further a food is from its natural state, the more likely it has lost beneficial nutrients while gaining added sugars, unhealthy fats, or refined starches,” Keatley explains. “Packaged plant-based meals, snacks, or meat alternatives often carry sodium levels comparable to processed meats and may include stabilizers and oils that don’t support cardiovascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champion also recommends being on the lookout for higher amounts of saturated fat, and making sure to read the nutrition label carefully. “The label ‘plant-based’ does not necessarily indicate anything about the healthiness of a food,” she stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to follow a heart-healthy diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, whole foods—not packaged products—are best for your heart health, according to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Wong, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Wong, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “I recommend the DASH Diet,” she says. “It’s low in salt, high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. It focuses on healthier fats like olive oil and avocado rather than animal fats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Mediterranean diet is also helpful for heart health, says Hosam Hmoud, M.D., cardiology fellow at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “I encourage all of my patients to follow a Mediterranean-style diet which consists of whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Keatley suggests filling your plate with whole foods first and building out your diet from there. “Most people already consume a plant-based diet if you look closely—grains, fruits, vegetables, and even snack foods all come from plants,” he points out. “The real distinction isn’t whether something is plant-based or not, but whether it’s minimally processed and nutrient-dense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:53:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9GdFUwXzJCVExOYXJvMzFoLWgwSmlXX3RpT2o4ek01SFZsODRTQWNFSjdqS2tONFJ3Q3FSQTFkaHp4WHA3YVlNaWRSejRsV09nTFVab1dkc1NCb1ZqMzVTRnUwWUdQUnZhdDQ1eWxZWmxsckg5Y3ZJdVVTUQ</guid></item><item><title>I-35 South在圣安东尼奥附近发生“重大碰撞”后重新开放- MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/traffic/article/i35-crash-schertz-21028870.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

This lack of regard for safety is often seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And female mice showed signs of memory problems when it came to recognizing familiar objects or completing mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe these behaviors mimic tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in humans, as men with the disease more likely to be indifferent or unmotivated while women have more memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggests that even being exposed to microplastics for a few weeks could cause lasting damage. And the latest research shows &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622989/How-cancer-causing-microplastics-body-based-age.html"&gt;nearly all Americans have detectable levels of the chemicals in their bodies&lt;/a&gt;, with exposure starting in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of Rhode Island found exposure to microplastics may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in mice (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jaime Ross, study author and professor of neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/02/alzheimers-symptoms-microplastics-mice-study/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm still really surprised by it. I just can't believe that you are exposed to these particles and something like this can happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly 7million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of memory-robbing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, about one in 14 people develop the disease by age 65, and one in three are diagnosed by 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae"&gt;Environmental Research Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at mice who were genetically modified to have the APOE4 mutation, which triples the risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in four Americans have the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the gene on its own significantly increases risk, the researchers caution it does not guarantee developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'If you are carrying APOE4, it doesn't mean you're going to develop Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't want to scare anybody. But it is the largest known risk factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly all Americans have been exposed to microplastics, which seep into vital organs and cause untold damage (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice in the study were also exposed to polystyrene microplastics for three weeks in their drinking water. The microplastics were between 0.1 and two micrometers in diameter, which is a fraction of the width of a human hair strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the exposure period, the researchers conducted behavioral testing, such as maze puzzles and object recognition. In one portion, mice were put in a square pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said healthy mice will generally stick to corners and avoid open spaces for safety reasons, but male mice with the APOE4 mutation who were exposed to microplastics tended to drift toward the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This showed a general lack of motivation or regard for safety, which is common in men with Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Female mice did not show the same behavior, but they did have memory issues and trouble remembering familiar objects significantly more than female mice who weren't exposed to microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also struggled to get through mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'There were very similar sex differences in mice as what people experience.'  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why microplastics raise the risk of Alzheimer's-like behaviors, but repeated exposure has been shown to increase oxidative stress, an imbalance of harmful molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxidative stress induces inflammation and damages cells, including those responsible for memory and executive function, which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can also cross the blood-brain barrier and block blood vessel function, causing brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that because the study was done in mice, it's unclear if humans would suffer the same effects.

This indicates a heightened health risk due to specific disease outbreaks, and travelers should take extra measures to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Pan American Health Organization warns that chikungunya cases are on the rise across the Americas with the hotspots currently being Brazil (with 210,711 cases) and Bolivia (with 5,159 cases). To date, there have been 55 cases reported in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chikungunya, which is spread by the Aedes mosquito, can cause sudden, agonizing joint pain in the hands and feet that can be so severe that it leaves sufferers unable to move normally for months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, more than 240,000 chikungunya cases and 90 chikungunya-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is a 'nationally notifiable' condition in the US, meaning health authorities can voluntarily report cases to the agency for national tracking and monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a handful of cases pop up in the US every year from people traveling to high-risk areas, it hasn't experienced local transmission since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But with more than 4.7 million US passengers flying internationally on any given day, mosquitoes in America could bite an infected traveler and begin transmitting the virus locally to Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-6b649d60-88cb-11f0-bc15-b319cc469bc9" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; remains a hotbed for the virus and it is currently battling its largest-ever outbreak of the illness with more than 10,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The spread of the mosquito-borne disease triggered a roll out of Covid-like restrictions in August, with disinfectant sprayed in streets and patients &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14976737/china-chikungunya-virus-covid-restrictions-outbreak.html"&gt;quarantined in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports surfaced that Chinese authorities in the city of Foshan cut electricity to some households that were not cooperating with health checks aimed at containing the chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chinese officials also deployed insecticide-spraying drones, 'cannibal' mosquitoes and killer fish to eliminate any insects that could be carrying the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louisa Messenger, a mosquito researcher in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-da3bf340-7490-11f0-8063-3b0c735712d8"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14976737/china-chikungunya-virus-covid-restrictions-outbreak.html"&gt;previously told DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'This outbreak in China is very concerning. It [the virus] could already be here in the US; and really it's just one plane flight away.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak in China remains ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the CDC, travel agencies and cruise lines also issued warnings about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, including chikungunya, dengue and Lyme disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14997619/hawaii-mosquito-dengue-fever-travelers-asia-africa.html"&gt;all of which have been detected in the US&lt;/a&gt; so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This summer, Norwegian Cruise Line warned guests traveling to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/italy/index.html" id="mol-cd9db780-792d-11f0-8038-e3c60c999bab" class=""&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; to use insect repellent and wear clothing treated with permethrin, which can repel ticks and mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are common in Italy, especially around coastal areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authorities in Italy reported the first locally acquired cases of both dengue and chikungunya, prompting the warnings from Norwegian Cruise Line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, one town in Massachusetts closed its parks and fields each evening last September after a man in his 80s caught eastern equine encephalitis from a mosquito bite. The rare but serious disease can cause severe inflammation of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of rising chikungunya cases, health officials in New Jersey state on the Department of Health website: 'The best way to prevent chikungunya is to prevent mosquito bites and avoid travel to areas with ongoing chikungunya outbreaks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is spread to humans from a bite from the Aedes mosquito, which also spread dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika virus. The infection does not spread from person to person through bodily contact or saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 10,000 cases have been detected in China so far, prompting Covid-era protections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above compares chikungunya symptoms to those from Zika virus and Dengue, which are both also spread by mosquitoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, pregnant women who become infected near the time of delivery can pass the virus to their baby during birth, which can result in severe illness in the newborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15 to 35 percent of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, the CDC reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mortality rate for chikungunya is generally low, estimated at less than one in 1,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incubation period is typically three to seven days and the most common symptom is a sudden onset of a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of chikungunya virus include headache, nausea, rash, muscle aches, swelling and redness of the conjunctiva (the white part of the eye and inner eyelids) and joint pain that is sometimes severe and debilitating in the hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, life-threatening complications involving the heart and brain can occur such as inflammation, irregular heartbeats and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms usually last seven to 10 days, but patients may experience lifelong complications such as persistent joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, and doctors mostly focus on easing symptoms like over-the-counter pain and fever medications. However, there are two vaccines available for people visiting an area with an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, chikungunya was rarely detected in American travelers before 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But between 2006 and 2013, the US logged around 30 imported cases a year, all in people who had recently visited affected regions in Asia, Africa or the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, a total of 2,799 cases were reported - including 12 that were locally acquired - in states and territories such as Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, making it the country's worst year on record for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, case numbers have declined and last year, the CDC recorded 199 travel-related chikungunya cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:59:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUi1CU3ROVnNBWFczWXMzZ0M0WU8zdlY4SG9YZTNEM0Y5VDBHdXhsLXlHUXRnYjUzRDk3QXBqQUoxYklqaXNfN1hnYkQtZ256VVVXVE8yVVk5LVBQUk0ybDVka1NzMGthajFDU0l6ckhpT2N1dzVTbFItcmRLNXB0TnhIbEJ4RGJBTGlkX2JjNFJUeGpHd3dRcUhXNFNnMWwyRTExa05UUdIBrAFBVV95cUxObTg0dmVaRHNXeTlRR2dJQW5nVzVUd1dkc3JRcjdISm5SYVEzU1ZmYklOSWNFeDMwbFc1VWYxX3JHa1daVmx3dU1UaUJpUU9ka1ZzenRGbURQQmhZbERTODllaDJlSGJaOGpCdUUwZTNPWVU0N2oyYWh5VUpGVGVlQm96MlBiaE9UaXRpWmtQTS1GN3dHOXJQNmhtaFVzY2hNYjlldU9fa3lQM2M2</guid></item><item><title>FDA质疑人们是否应该同时接种多种呼吸道疫苗-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/03/vaccine-access-covid-flu-fda-safety/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKF049WUR10TZ5B3574D5J8WFG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is scrutinizing the common practice of giving coronavirus and flu shots together, signaling a reversal of years of federal guidance and a broader crackdown on administering multiple vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:51:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQNjJEZUpraHhjSUFwWV9UXzZRVzNEMzZqY3dHejVHNFZVTkhhaHlIUjd0a3M3cDhRWHlVazlvc1lxbEhkdUU3czktLWJ0QlprTXVOdTdSSFVUT0taUDE5bktRekJ4TnpCOUlsOGFkT1JMZzBYUW9iUGV4NW8zbzZNbzhGell5VTFTcTBILWhR</guid></item><item><title>吱吱作响的膝盖对您的长期健康意味着什么- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/what-creaky-knees-really-mean-for-your-long-term-health-2000652662</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Here’s some potential good news for runners or people fresh off knee surgery: Your creaking knees might not indicate deeper health issues. New research finds that knee creaking is not associated with a greater risk of arthritis in people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists at La Trobe University in Australia led the study, which examined the long-term outcomes of young patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Though people with knee creaking did experience more pain on average in the first year following surgery, they ultimately fared no worse than people without creaky knees years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that creaky knees might not be a reliable predictor of future arthritis, even in people healing from traumatic injuries, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A noisy universal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a snap, crackle, and pop knee is formally known as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/osteoarthritis/crepitus"&gt;knee crepitus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a common condition, &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(24)00414-X/fulltext"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to affect about 41% of the general public. While people of all ages can have knee crepitus, including people who aren’t experiencing any pain, studies have shown it’s especially common in people with osteoarthritis. That’s led some doctors to argue that crepitus should be seen as a clear early warning signal of arthritis in high-risk groups, including knee surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test out this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 112 young patients (median age 28) who had their ACL repaired. Following surgery, the participants’ knee health was tracked for five years, which included people’s self-assessment of relevant symptoms like knee pain and crepitus; the participants also received an MRI of their knee one year and five years after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Creaking but not broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though people with crepitus did have a tougher time at first, things eventually balanced out for both groups, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found that those with knee crepitus demonstrated more than two and a half times greater rates of full-thickness cartilage defects in the kneecap area, with more pain and poorer function early on,” said lead author Jamon Couch, a physical therapist and graduate researcher at La Trobe, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-noisy-knees-early-arthritis.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “But over the next four years, those with crepitus did not experience worse pain and function compared to those without knee crepitus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with ruptured ACLs are at higher long-term risk for osteoarthritis in general. So the findings, &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25637"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Arthritis Care and Research, should provide some reassurance that having creaky knees isn’t a sure-fire predictor for later issues, the researchers say, particularly in younger people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ACL patients specifically, there are other reasons to believe knee creaking on its own shouldn’t be seen as a major concern for the average person. A review last year by the same authors &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39375004/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 36% of people without knee pain experience crepitus, for instance, just a smidge below the percentage seen in the overall public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts do &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/by-itself-knee-crunching-sound-generally-not-cause-for-concern/"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people who have other knee symptoms besides crepitus, such as pain or swelling, should consider seeing a doctor to have it checked out. There’s also a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/knee-exercises-for-runners/"&gt;strengthening exercises&lt;/a&gt; out there that can help you improve or maintain your knee health, especially if you run. And being active in general is good for your joints.&lt;/p&gt;

Human iPS cells were cultured using a feeder-free method on Matrigel-coated (Thermo Fisher Scientific) plates in mTeSR plus medium (100-0276, StemCell). The media were changed every other day, and cells were passaged as clumps every 4–6 days using ReLeSR (100-0483, StemCell).

For the &lt;i&gt;PICALM&lt;/i&gt; expression assay, the grey matter was dissected from brain blocks on dry ice. RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo), and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were set up using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix for qPCR (Applied Biosystems) and run on the QuantStudio Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The data were analysed using the &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({2}^{-\Delta \Delta {C}_{t}}\)&lt;/span&gt; method and normalized to &lt;i&gt;COTL1&lt;/i&gt;.

All ROSMAP participants enrolled without known dementia and agreed to detailed clinical evaluation and brain donation at death. Both studies were approved by the Rush University Medical Center IRB. The sections were incubated at 60 °C for 60 min, deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of increasingly dilute ethanol solutions. Epitope retrieval was performed using decloaking buffer (Biocare Medical) at 95 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, freshly prepared 0.1% sodium borohydride was added to the sections and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Peroxidase blocking (3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were then treated with permeabilization buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× TBS) at room temperature for 45 min. Non-specific epitopes were blocked by incubating the sections for 60 min in blocking buffer-I (10% donkey serum, 1% BSA, 0.3 M glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100) followed by a 60 min incubation with background punisher (Biocare Medical). Antibody staining was performed at room temperature using the intelliPATH FLX system and reagents provided by the manufacturer (Biocare Medical). Rabbit anti-PICALM antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019061, 1:200) and goat anti-IBA1 (Abcam, ab5076, 1:1,000) were incubated with the sections for 48 h at 4 °C. After washing, secondary antibodies were applied and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Autofluorescence was quenched using 0.1% Sudan Black B in 70% ethanol, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Finally, coverslips were mounted using VectorShield mounting medium. Images were acquired on an automated Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope fitted with the Yokogawa spinning-disk field-scanning confocal system and Photometrics PRIME 95B sCMOS camera, using a ×20 objective. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; stack images were deconvolved using Nikon NIS-Elements AR5.20.01 software and processed with Fiji/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit). For quantification of PICALM in IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, all processing was conducted by a researcher blinded to individual diagnoses. Images were acquired on the SLIDEVIEW VS200 slide scanner (Olympus) using ×20 magnification. Individual microglia were cropped using OlyVIA software (Olympus). All further processing was conducted in FiJi/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit). Background fluorescence was measured from non-specific tissue staining and normalized by subtracting 50% of the measured values. Binary masks of microglia were generated by thresholding the IBA1 signal, and manually inspected to remove non-specific signals or adjacent cells. PICALM signal was multiplied by the microglial masks, and fluorescence intensities (integrated densities) were measured. Data were plotted and analysed using Prism 10 (GraphPad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;iMG differentiation from human iPS cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs were generated from human iPS cell lines as described in our previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Butler Iii, R.

At least 2 days after passaging, when human iPS cells reached about 80% confluency, they were dissociated with Accutase (07920, StemCell) and plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well round-bottom ultra-low-attachment plates (7007, Corning) in 100 µl embryoid body (EB) medium (complete mTeSR with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; BMP-4 (120-05, PeproTech), 20 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; SCF (300-07, PeproTech), 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; VEGF-121 (100-20 A, PeproTech) and ROCK inhibitor (1254/1, R&amp;amp;D Systems)). Haematopoietic medium was prepared by adding to the X-VIVO 15 (BE08-879H, Lonza), 1% GlutaMax (35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (10378016, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol (21985023, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; M-CSF (300-25, PeproTech) and 25 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-3 (200-03, PeproTech). After 5 days of culturing EBs in haematopoietic medium, primitive macrophage progenitors (PMPs) started appearing in the suspension and were produced continuously in suspension for 34 days. After 10 days of culturing EBs, PMPs were collected from suspension and plated in RPMI 1640 medium (21870076, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 180,000 cells per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 6- or 12-well plates. Complete iMG medium was as follows: RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS (S11150H, R&amp;amp;D Systems), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% GlutaMax, 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-34 (200-34, PeptroTech) and 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; GM-CSF (300-03, PeproTech). The final differentiation of PMPs into iMGs occurred over 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;iAst cell differentiation from NPCs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPS-cell-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were prepared using PSC neural induction medium (A1647801, Thermo Fisher Scientific). NPCs were differentiated to astrocytes by seeding dissociated single cells at 15,000 cells per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; density on Matrigel-coated plates in astrocyte medium (1801, ScienCell: astrocyte medium, 2% FBS (0010), astrocyte growth supplement (1852) and 10 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin–streptomycin solution (0503)). The initial NPC seeding density and single-cell dissociation are critical, particularly during the first 30 days of differentiation, to efficiently generate a homogenous population of astrocytes. On day −1, NPCs were pipetted with a p1000 pipette 3–5 times to yield a single-cell suspension and inhibit cell death. The NPC medium was switched to the astrocyte medium on day 0. From day 2, cells were fed every 48 h for 20–30 days. After 30 days of differentiation, astrocytes were split 1:3 weekly with Accutase and expanded for up to 120 days (15–17 passages) in the astrocyte medium.

Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Plus Kit (74134, Qiagen). cDNAs were reverse transcribed from RNAs using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (4368814, Applied Biosystems). RNA-seq was performed by Novogene on the Illumina NovaSeq 2000 platform with targeted 30 million paired-end reads (2 × 150 bp) per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;RNA-seq data and differential expression analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw FASTQ files were aligned to the human hg38 genome GRCh38.p14 using STAR v.2.7.2 and counted according to GENCODE annotation release version 35 on the fly.

As noted above, WASP-calibrated BAM files were used as input and variants were called against the human GRCh38.p14 (hg38) reference genome and the corresponding dbSNP version 154, and only reads with MAPQ score ≥ 30 were used (-stand_call_conf 30). Subsequently, recalibration of SNPs and indels was performed in tandem using the VariantRecalibrator function (-an DP -an QD -an FS -an SOR -an MQ -an ReadPosRankSum -mode SNP -tranche 100.0 -tranche 99.5 -tranche 95.0 -tranche 90.0) and scores were recalibrated using reference database including HapMap v.3.3 (priority = 15), 1000G_omni v2.5 (priority = 12), Broad Institute 1000G high-confidence SNP list phase 1 (priority = 10), Mills 1000G golden standard INDEL list (priority = 12) and dbSNP v154 (priority = 2). Heterozygous SNP sites with tranche level &amp;gt;99.5% were extracted. To reduce bias introduced by any acquired (or de novo) mutations during cell growth, only SNPs with corresponding rs# records found in dbSNP v154 were retained. Biallelic SNP sites (GT: 0/1) with minimum read depth count (DP) ≥ 20 and minimum reference or alternative allele count ≥ 2 were retained. The binomial &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (non-hyperbolic) were calculated using binom.test(x, n, P = 0.5, alternative = “two.sided”, conf.level = 0.95) from the R package, and Benjamini–Hochberg correction was applied to all qualified SNPs as the correcting factor of the R function p.adjust(x, method = “fdr”).

Then pHrodo-labelled myelin or Aβ was diluted to 15 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in RPMI 1640 medium, bath sonicated for 1 min and added to the iMGs along with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent and incubated at 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 37 °C for 30 min. As a negative control, 10 µM cytochalasin D was added to cells along with pHrodo-labelled protein and retained throughout uptake assays. Live Imaging (5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 37 °C) was performed for a total of 3 h using Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U microscope at 45 min intervals. Fiji/ImageJ (v.1.54f, 64 bit) software was used to quantify pHrodo fluorescence intensity (&lt;a href="https://fiji.sc"&gt;https://fiji.sc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;ChIP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ChIP–qPCR assay was performed by combining two protocols from the Simple ChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (91820, Cell Signaling) and the Magna ChIP A/G Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit (17-10085, Sigma-Aldrich). In total, 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells were used for each reaction with 1% formaldehyde (28908, Thermo Fisher Scientific) cross-linking in 20 ml of cell suspension. The Cell Signaling IP kit was used for nuclei preparation and subsequent recovery reactions according to the vendor’s protocols. For chromatin digestion, 1.25 µl of micrococcal nuclease was used and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to digest DNA to the length of approximately 150–900 bp. To break the nuclear membrane, lysate was sonicated for three sets of 20 s pulses with a 1/8-inch probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sigma-Aldrich ChIP Assay kit was used for the reaction according to the vendor’s instructions. Normal rabbit IgG (2729, Cell Signaling) was used as negative control. In total, 1 µl of proteinase K was used for reverse cross-linking of protein–DNA complexes to free DNA at 62 °C for 2 h with shaking, followed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. For each reaction, DNA was eluted into 50 µl of elution buffer C. qPCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (4364338, Applied Biosystems) on the Roche 480 II instrument, using IDT custom probe for detection PICALM/PU.1 ratio (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09486-x#MOESM1"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;). The ChIP DNA product for the heterozygous site rs10792832 was also subjected to Sanger sequencing (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sequencing Analysis Software 7.0.0). Genomics DNAs for the heterozygous site were sequenced by using primers used for on-target CRISPR–Cas9 editing of rs10792832.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Fatty acid (Red-C12) transfer assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMG and iAst cells were grown on coverslips until day 25.

Next, cells were incubated in complete iMG medium with BODIPY 581/591 C11 (D3861, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1,000) for 15 min at 37 °C, then fixed for antibody staining by rat anti-TREM-2 (MABN755, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100). Five hundred and sixty-eight nm excitation wavelength was applied to excite reduced BODIPYC11 and 488 nm excited oxidized BODIPYC11. Fiji/ImageJ (v.1.54f 64 bit) software was used to quantify BODIPYC11 fluorescence intensity (&lt;a href="https://fiji.sc"&gt;https://fiji.sc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Filipin staining for iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs were grown on glass coverslips until day 25. Cells were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% PFA (P6148, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Cells were incubated with a solution of filipin (0.1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, F‐9765, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. After staining with were rat anti-TREM-2 (MABN755, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100), cells were washed and counterstained with propidium iodide (0.35 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; P4170, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature. Four hundred and five nm excitation wavelength was used to excite filipin. For each field of view (FOV), filipin fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the number of blue puncta by the number of microglia. The values were then normalized to the filipin fluorescence intensity value of the risk allele and used for statistical analysis. The Fiji software was used to quantify filipin fluorescence intensity (&lt;a href="https://fiji.sc"&gt;https://fiji.sc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Lysosomal staining for iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs were grown on glass coverslips until day 25. Cells were incubated with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (L7528, Invitrogen, 100 nM) in complete iMG medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% methanol-free PFA (28906, Pierce) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then stained with BODIPY as described above (LD staining with BODIPY) to detect LDs. The images were taken on a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;FACS sorting of iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs were grown on six-well plates until day 25. iMGs were then dissociated with Accutase (07920, StemCell) and stained with CD45-PE (12-0451-82, Invitrogen, 1:300) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed with RPMI medium three times by centrifugation at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min.

Control oligo sequences were generated using sequences not specific to the human genome. Recombinant lentiviruses were generated in HEK293T cells using MISSION Lentiviral Packaging Mix (Sigma-Aldrich, SHP001). C20 cells were transduced with filtered virus-containing medium, and stable pools were selected in blasticidin (20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Immunoblots for iMG and C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For iMG, cells were lysed in phosphosafe buffer (71296, EMD Millipore) with protease inhibitor (04693132001, Roche) and PhosphoSTOP tablet (4906845001, Roche). Next, 50 μg of protein lysates were run on TGX Stain-Free Precast Gel (4–15%) (4561083, Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer (1610732, Bio-Rad). The gel was then transferred onto a 0.45-μm PVDF membrane (88585, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with rabbit anti-PICALM (HPA019061, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1,000) or mouse anti-β-actin (A5316, Millipore, 1:10,000) at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit-HRP (7074, Cell Signaling, 1:20,000) and anti-mouse-HRP (7076, Cell Signaling, 1:20,000), were then added. The blots were imaged and quantified using Bio-Rad Image Lab v.6.1.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For C20 line, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche), sonicated and lysates cleared by centrifugation (21,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 2 min). Fifty μg of lysate was used per lane on 4–20% SDS PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Non-specific sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 1% fish gelatin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies rabbit anti-PICALM (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019061, 1:500) and mouse anti-β-actin (Proteintech, 66009-1-lg, 1:50,000) in at 4 °C for 16 h. Secondary antibodies IRDye 680RD donkey anti-rabbit IgG and IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG (Li-COR) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Blots were imaged and quantified on a Li-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Myelin phagocytosis for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myelin isolated from the mouse brain (as described above) was conjugated to pHrodo-Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35369) or pHrodo-Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36600). C20 cells were incubated with pHrodo-conjugated myelin (20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 37 °C (5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 1 h. Negative controls were treated with cytochalasin D (10 nM, Invitrogen). After fixation, cells were stained with rabbit anti-BIN1 antibody (Proteintech, 14647-1-AP, 1:500) for 2 h. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 (Yokogawa spinning-disk field-scanning confocal) microscope at ×20 magnification and captured using a Photometrics PRIME 95B sCMOS camera. Single-plane images were processed using Fiji/ImageJ (v.1.54f, 64 bit) software to threshold whole-cell masks (created from BIN1 staining). The integrated density of pHrodo-myelin within each cell was measured from five random fields of view (per biological replicates) and the median values from each replicate were used for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec47"&gt;LD staining for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live C20 cells were labelled with BODIPY (2 µM in PBS) at 37 °C (5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 15 min. At room temperature, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, and nuclei were labelled with Hoechst 33342. The volumes of BODIPY&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; droplets and the number of nuclei was quantified from deconvolved image stacks using ImageJ (v.1.54f, 64 bit)/Fiji software. Five random fields of view (per biological replicate) were acquired for quantification, and the median values from each biological replicate were used for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec48"&gt;Organelle marker staining for C20 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transferrin endocytosis, C20 cells were washed and incubated in uptake medium (DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES) for 1 h. Cells were treated with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; transferrin Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate (Invitrogen, T35352) in DMEM/HEPES containing 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then chilled to 4 °C, and non-internalized transferrin was washed from cell surfaces with acid wash (0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 M acetic acid, pH 2.8) before fixing the cells in PFA. For cholera toxin internalization, cells were washed with labelling medium (1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; BSA in serum-free DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES), chilled to 4 °C and treated with 100 nM cholera toxin subunit B Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Invitrogen, C34778) in labelling medium at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA (in PBS) at room temperature for 15 min. Nuclei were labelled with Hoechst 33342.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunofluorescence staining with antibodies, C20 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA and blocked (3% BSA, 50 mM NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, 10 mM glycine, PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Giantin (Covance, PRB-114C, 1:5,000), mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610457, 1:500) or mouse anti-AP-4ε (BD Transduction, 612018, 1:100) antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. All C20 cell images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 spinning-disk field-scanning confocal microscope at ×60 magnification. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stacks (100 nm step size) were processed to generate maximum-intensity projections using Fiji/ImageJ (1.54f, 64 bit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec49"&gt;Lipid extraction from iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iMGs carrying the &lt;i&gt;PICALM&lt;/i&gt; risk allele, non-risk allele or risk-CRISPRa were grown in six-well plates until day 25. iMGs were dissociated with Accutase (07920, StemCell), collected and washed with PBS three times by centrifugation at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min.

In brief, a deuterated lipid standard mixture (330820, LM6003, 860739, 330727, 860657, 860658, Avanti Research) was added to iMGs equally and organic solvent (chloroform:methanol, 1:2 (v/v)) was added to iMG pellets and subjected to tip sonication, followed by vortexing and centrifugation to extract neutral lipid. The organic layer was collected and saved for later use and acidic extraction was performed on the remaining pellet by a mixture of chloroform:methanol:37% 1 M HCl (40:80:1, v/v/v). After the addition of chloroform and 0.1 M HCl to induce phase separation, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged. The bottom organic layer was combined with the previously collected organic layer and dried using vacuum centrifuge. The dried lipid extract was reconstituted in methanol:chloroform (1:3, v/v) for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec50"&gt;Lipidomics analysis of iMGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipid extracts were subjected to global lipidomics analysis using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). LC–MS-grade methanol (A456, Thermo Fisher Scientific), acetonitrile (A955, Thermo Fisher Scientific), isopropanol (A461, Thermo Fisher Scientific), water (W71, Thermo Fisher Scientific), formic acid (A117, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ammonium formate (78314, Millipore Sigma) were used. The samples from two different iMG differentiations were analysed, with lipidomics data acquired in two technical replicates for each sample. Reconstituted lipid extracts were separated on a Hypersil GOLD Vanquish C18 UHPLC column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, C18 1.9 μm and 175 Å) using an Orbitrap Tribrid IQ-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to Vanquish Horizon UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A binary gradient was used at a flow rate of 300 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, using mobile phase A (water:acetonitrile, 6:4, with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and organic phase (isopropanol:methanol:acetonitrile, 8:1:1, with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid). In brief, mobile phase B increased from 20% to 95% over 17 min and was maintained at 95% for 5 min for washing. It was ramped down to 20% over 0.1 min and equilibrated for 5 min for the next injection. The analytical column was maintained at 50 °C. A full-scan MS was performed using the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 200. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 15,000 at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 200. MS/MS scans were acquired for 1.5 s, followed by an MS scan. In positive-ion mode, MS/MS fragmentation using a stepped collision energy of 30%, 35% and 40% in higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was performed with a spray voltage of 3.5 kV. In negative-ion mode, a spray voltage of 3 kV and a stepped collision energy of 30%, 35% and 40% in MS/MS acquisition using HCD were used. The acquired tandem mass spectra were processed using LipidSearch v.5.1.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for lipid annotation and quantification. Lipids were identified based on precursor ion masses and their corresponding MS/MS spectra were matched against the database. Annotated lipids were quantified by calculating their peak areas using LipidSearch. All lipids were normalized to the peak area of an internal standard with the same head group as the target lipids. Total lipid levels were determined by summing the peak areas of individual lipid species sharing the same head group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec51"&gt;Imaging quantification and statistical analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For image analyses, we assayed fluorescence intensity, puncta density, puncta area and/or puncta size using the number of samples specified in the corresponding figures. For each FOV, the fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the number of fluorescent puncta by the number of microglia. The puncta number and the total area of puncta were acquired by applying a threshold to the respective fluorescent areas and performing the Analyze particles function. The number of microglia was calculated by applying a threshold to the DAPI fluorescence signal and measuring the number of nuclei through the same function. The images were acquired in a manner that the operator was blinded to the sample and genotype identification. For testing statistical differences between two groups, we used a two-tailed unpaired Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test when the experimental design did not involve multiple batches (for example, different rounds of experiments); otherwise, we used the R packages lme4 and lmerTest to fit data into an LMM to account for potential random effects from different experimental rounds and clones. For statistical tests involving more than two groups, we applied a one-way ANOVA with the appropriate post hoc test (Dunnett or Tukey), while accounting for any possible random effects from experimental rounds when applicable. The data analysis was performed using R v.4.3.2, GraphPad Prism 9 and Microsoft Excel. The results were considered to be significant if &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.

She was diagnosed with vibrio in her left leg on July 30."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher believes the bacteria infected her body through a small cut on her left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She started showing symptoms three days after she went boating with her husband, Dana, and her 7-year-old daughter, Mila, behind the Pensacola Beach Boardwalk and swam near Quietwater Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The 49-year-old is the coordinator of a physician practice for cardiology at Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, and she was at work on July 30 when she began sweating, feeling unwell, and her leg swelled and bubbled with blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That afternoon Gallagher was in the emergency room where they rushed her into surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I thought I had an infection, but never did I think I had a flesh-eating bacterium,” Gallagher said. “There’s no antibiotics that they can give you to stop it. They just have to get out any infected skin and tissue. They’ve got to get it off your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher said she went into septic shock, which caused her organs to fail. She was intubated for nearly a week while medical staff worked to save her, including repeatedly scrubbing and cleaning out her leg and removing any dying tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her family stayed by her bedside around the clock after doctors warned them that she could not only lose her leg but her life to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“They were finally able to get me stable enough to wake me up. Sacred Heart saved my leg, thank God,” Gallagher said. “Mila saw me in the hospital and said, ‘I wish this happened to me and not you,’ and I started crying. That broke my heart. I was like ‘Mila, no, I'm so glad it didn't happen to you. Your little body could not have taken all this that's going on.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Medical staff at Shands are now working to help Gallagher recover. The vibrio bacteria is gone but repairing the damage it caused to her leg isn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She’s had multiple surgeries including having muscle removed from her back and placed on her leg where the bone was exposed. The flap surgery didn’t take due to blood clots, however, and she’ll have to undergo surgery again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Just looking at my leg, it doesn't even look like my leg anymore,” Gallagher described. “It looks deformed right now. The pain is unbelievable. It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire. That's what it feels like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She's expected to remain in the hospital another two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Vibrio warning for others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Florida Department of Health, vibrio vulnificusis&lt;/a&gt;—a bacterium that normally lives in warm seawater— infections are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, FDOH warns against entering the water if you have fresh cuts or scrapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher is sharing her story as a warning to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The day she went swimming she took steps to cover the small cut on her leg with a waterproof bandage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, she said she would not have gone into the water at all had she known the bacterial infection was such a serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When it's so hot and that water is not moving, that bacteria is just growing and growing and growing,” she said. “There are no signs out there saying, ‘Hey, this water has a high infection rate for vibrio,’ or, ‘Hey, this water tested positive,’ like they do in Panama City, because I'm sure if they did, people would not be swimming over there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to FDOH, so far this year there have been 23 cases of vibrio and five deaths in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;No one has died from the illness in Northwest Florida, but there are two cases in Escambia County, two cases in Santa Rosa County, one case in Okaloosa County and one case in Walton County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In 2024, there were 82 cases and 19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People can also get infected when they eat raw shellfish, particularly oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done to improve safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Escambia County Commissioner Ashlee Hofberger, who represents Pensacola Beach, said she would “absolutely” consider installing warning signs at places where people swim and/or access local waterways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She already wants to see more done to notify the general public when there are potentially hazardous swimming conditions for a variety of reasons, including heightened risk of bacteria that flourish in the wake of sewage spills.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Vibrio feeds off two different types of bacteria, but one of the main things that they feed off of is fecal matter,” Hofberger said. “If we have a contamination spill of sewage and it flows into the water, typically you get an uptick in vibrio. I want to make sure that if we do have a sewage spill, the community is aware of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gallagher is grateful for the medical care and support she has received through her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She hopes her story will help protect others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It's been a lot on me and my family,” Gallagher said. “My husband drives to Shands every weekend and stays with me because my mental health has just been horrible. I’ve been strong through it all, but it’s been a lot mentally, emotionally and physically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Pensacola News Journal</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:24:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxObTJOVlZzUXNVQ25Fb1ZXcy1vNVhIVlV5c05QZkZMYnRUQlRPMGhmT1A2M2lJS0dFUjd6Z1Z4SWpKM0M4NDUtdTJ2S2RnX1oxYXlvUnFPb3VUUTRCcmlNbDhTeGVIbmpxdWVJaEFONWJvdUJ2dFpwVDV4NEp4MTM4UldRUEVIcVJRQkVublY3d2FBMDFzUk5uVjFMY3lXbU5fUVBPN3hSb0c2VEZJbERnY0xMek04YUFnRHVyVjlNNmNBSV9qMEhsVmlYRnhRTkJicGtOdmtmajZ5VkNseVE</guid></item><item><title>杏仁核-肝脏信号传导协调对压力的血糖反应-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09420-1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec11-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12"&gt;Animals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice (8–40 weeks old) were housed under controlled light conditions (12 h light/12 h dark) and temperature (22 °C) and fed ad libitum on standard mouse chow.

Mice were anaesthetized using 2% isoflurane and the top of the head was shaved then cleaned with 70% ethanol. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes and subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (0.05 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were given to each mouse prior to surgery. An incision was made on the midline and small craniotomies were made using a dental drill. Thirty-three gauge syringe needles (Hamilton) were used to unilaterally or bilaterally infuse virus into the brain at a rate of 0.1 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The following volumes and coordinates were used: MeA, 0.3–0.5 µl, 1.4 mm posterior, 2.5 mm lateral (2.55 mm if mouse body weight &amp;gt;25 g, 2.6 mm if mouse body weight &amp;gt;30 g), and 5.35 mm ventral from bregma; VMH, 0.3 µl, 1.2 mm posterior, 0.23 mm lateral, and 5.6 mm ventral from bregma; BNST, 0.3 µl, 0.2 mm anterior, 0.85 mm lateral, and 4.3 mm ventral from bregma.

Mice were allowed at least 6 weeks for recovery and to facilitate sufficient viral expression prior to any experimental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Fibre photometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were tethered to a patch cable (Doric Lenses, MFP_400/430/1100-0.57_3m_FCM-M1.25). Calcium signals were collected using the Doric Fluorescence MiniCube and fibre photometry console at a sampling frequency of 12 kHz using Synapse software (v.98, Tucker-Davis Technologies). GCaMP calcium signal (465 nm) and UV isosbestic signal (405 nm) were collected through the same fibre and equalized to record an equivalent signal:noise ratio. MATLAB (v.2022b, Mathworks) scripts provided by Tucker-Davis Technologies were used to down-sample and normalize the fluorescence signal. For projection specific calcium imaging, photobleaching was corrected using double exponential fit. The 405 isobestic fluorescence signal was filtered using a polyfit regression giving a fitted control (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405c&lt;/sub&gt;). Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; was calculated by subtracting &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405c&lt;/sub&gt; from the GCaMP fluorescence signal (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405&lt;/sub&gt;) and then dividing by &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405c&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;465&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405c&lt;/sub&gt;)/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;405&lt;/sub&gt;. A &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score conversion was used to calculate the deviation of the resulting Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; from the averaged signal of the entire recording session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were tethered to the patch cable, and a 5 min baseline recording was collected. Mice were then restrained in plastic 50-ml conical tubes (Fisher Scientific) with holes that were modified to account for the patch cable tethering. Calcium transients were recorded for 5 or 30 min while the mouse remained secured. After the restraint, the mouse was released and recording continued for an additional 15 min. When noted, blood glucose was measured every minute for the duration of a 5 min restraint stress or every 5 min for the duration of a 30 min restraint stress to assess the time course of stress-induced hyperglycaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Territorialized cage stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were tethered to a patch cord, placed in a clean novel cage with bedding, and recording started. A 5 min baseline was collected in the ‘clean’ novel cage before the mouse was manually picked up by the base of the tail and placed in a novel territorialized cage that was previously occupied by 5 males for 1 week. The mice remained in this cage while calcium transients were recorded for 5 or 30 min before the mouse was placed back in the previous clean cage for 5 min. To examine the effects of repeated stress, a cycle of 2 min of territorialized cage exposure, followed by 3 min of clean cage exposure was repeated for a total of 5 novel territorialized cage exposures. To examine the effects of intermediate stress, mice were exposed to a novel territorialized cage for 5 min at intervals of 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h from the initial territorialized cage exposure. When noted, blood glucose was measured every minute for the duration of a 5 min territorialized cage stress or every 5 min for the duration of a 30 min territorialized cage stress to assess the time course of stress-induced hyperglycaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Footshock stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of an acute physical stressor, mice were exposed to a mild footshock. Mice were tethered to a patch cord and placed into a fear conditioning chamber. A 5 min baseline was collected before a 1 s, 1 mA footshock was delivered. The calcium transients were recorded during the shock and post shock for at least 2 min. We scored the calcium response at the time of the shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Robobug stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of an acute visual stressor, mice were tethered to a patch cord and placed into an open field arena. After 5 min, a remote-controlled spider (robobug) was introduced into the open field and began to pursue the mouse at random intervals. The calcium transients were recorded during the approach and post-approach for at least 1 min. We scored the calcium response at the time of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring was performed in a subset of mice during calcium imaging and stress exposure. In brief, under isoflurane anaesthesia, hair was removed from the flank of the mouse and a 2 mm incision made in the skin. The cannula of the continuous glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre 2) was inserted into the incision and the adhesive tape on the monitor firmly applied to the skin. Discontinuous sutures around the sensor attached the adhesive tape to the skin. The sensor was activated, and mice were allowed to recover for 24 h before fibre photometry and stress exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Optogenetics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photostimulation was performed with 10 ms pulses given at 20 Hz for 2 s, repeated every 2 s. The output beam from a 473 nm diode laser (Thorlabs) was controlled by a microcontroller (Uno, Arduino, IDE 2.3.1) running a pulse generation script. The laser was coupled to a 200 µm, NA 0.66 multimode optical fibre (MFC_400/430-0.66_6mm_MF1.25_FLT) (Doric) using a 1.25 mm mating sleeve (Thorlabs) that allowed delivery of the light into the brain by coupling to the implanted fibre optic. Laser power was measured using an optic power meter (Thorlabs) and set at 5 mW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Metabolic studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each experiment, mice were tethered to a patch cable, placed in an open field arena, and habituated for at least 1 h to account for the handling stress. For basal glucose measurements during optogenetic modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 5, 15 and 30 min after the initiation of stimulation. To measure tolerance to a glucose challenge, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after injection of glucose (2 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight) and the initiation of stimulation. To measure gluconeogenic capacity, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (2 g kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Sigma P5280). Data are shown as the change in blood glucose from baseline (immediately before stimulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Stress studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each experiment, mice were tethered to a patch cable, placed in an open field arena, and habituated for at least 1 h to account for the handling stress. Mice were exposed to both restraint and territorialized cage stress as described above. For stressed glucose measurements during optogenetic modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30 min. For 5 min stressors, the mice were optogenetically stimulated for 5 min, beginning at the initiation of stress. For 30 min stressors, the mice were optogenetically stimulated for 15 min, beginning at the initiation of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;In vivo chemogenetic behavioural testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were handled for 5–10 days before experiments. Following stereotaxic surgeries, mice were allowed to recover for 3–6 weeks before the start of testing. Where applicable, CNO (Sigma, NIH) was dissolved in 10% DMSO in saline and delivered at a dose of 3 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, intraperitoneal injection. Investigators were blinded to treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were fasted for 6 h and then either briefly handled and returned to home cage (controls) or restrained in a 50-ml falcon tube with a hole cut for air at the conical end for 5 or 30 min. For 5 min restraint experiments, blood glucose was measured before the initiation of stress, after the 5 min restraint, and 30 min after the initiation of the stress. For 30 min restrain experiments, blood glucose was measured before and after the 30 min restraint period. To measure the hormonal or gene expression responses to stress, mice were rapidly anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane at the end of the restraint period and blood or tissue collected. To measure FOS in the MeA after restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 30 min before restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Repeated restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the effects of chronic repeated restraint stress on blood glucose, blood glucose was measured before and after a 30 min restraint stress at 12 h intervals for a total of 9 restraint sessions. To measure FOS in the MeA after chronic restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Territorialized cage stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in a dirty cage previously occupied by five male mice for one week. Blood glucose or food intake was measured before and after the 5 or 30 min period of territorialized cage exposure. For blood glucose measurement, mice were fasted for 6 h. To measure food intake, mice were food-deprived overnight before being placed in the territorialized cage. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered immediately before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Food intake studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were food-deprived overnight or food-deprived for 6 h in the light phase or allowed to eat ad libitum. Food, either in the form of standard rodent chow or palatable food (peanut butter) was then provided in excess, and consumption of food was measured every hour. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered immediately before food was provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Metabolic studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For baseline glucose measurements after DREADD modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min after intraperitoneal injection of CNO. To measure tolerance to a glucose challenge, mice were fasted for 6 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection of glucose (2 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight). When noted, additional blood was collected at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min after glucose injection to measure plasma insulin and glucagon. To measure insulin sensitivity and tolerance to an insulin challenge, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 105 min after injection of insulin (0.4–0.6 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Humulin R HI-210). To measure gluconeogenic capacity, mice were fasted for 4 h and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 105 min after intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (2 g kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight, Sigma P5280). For all metabolic challenges, CNO was injected 30 min before the challenge (timepoint 0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Open field activity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locomotion and anxiety-like behaviour were measured in either a clear plexiglass 40 × 40 × 30 cm open field arena using Fusion Software (v5.0) (Omnitech Electronics) or a white acrylic 18 × 18 × 18 in arena using Ethovision XT (version xt13, Noldus Information Technology) to quantify behaviour. Distance travelled and time spent in the center of the open field arena were measured. Open field testing lasted 10 min. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Elevated plus maze and light-dark box&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-dark box test was performed in a 40 × 40 × 30 cm arena with a black box placed on half of the arena to shield it from light. The mice were placed in the light portion and tracked using Fusion Software. For the elevated plus maze, the mice were placed on an open arm of an elevated four-arm maze in which two arms are open and two are enclosed. They were tracked using Ethovision software and total time spent in the open arm was measured. Elevated plus maze and light-dark box testing lasted 10 min.For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;High-fat diet&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; expression of DTA or mCherry were fed a high-fat diet (Research Diets, D12492; 60% fat). Food intake, body weight and blood glucose were measured every 3–7 days for 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Metyrapone studies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pharmacologically block corticosterone production, mice were injected with metyrapone (50 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, subcutaneous injection, dissolved in 5% Tween 80, Tocris Bioscience) or vehicle 60 min before the initiation of restraint stress, basal glucose measurements, or glucose administration during GTT. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 30 min before the start of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Neuronal tracing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To trace MeA projection circuits, an injection of AAV8.2-hEF1a-synaptophysin-mCherry was unilaterally injected into the MeA. After 4–6 weeks to allow viral expression, brains were collected and prepared for imaging as described in the Immunohistochemistry section. Sections from the whole brain were imaged to allow unbiased selection of MeA projection targets. After mCherry-labelled regions were identified, fluorescence intensity was quantified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine axonal projection overlap in the MeA, mice were injected with AAVretro-GFP into the VMH and AAVretro-RFP into the BNST to differentially label MeA neurons that project to the VMH and MeA neurons that project to the BNST. Expression of GFP and of RFP in the MeA was quantified to determine axonal projection overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine MeA projection circuit specificity, mice were injected with a AAVretro-GFP into the VMH and AAVretro-RFP into the BNST to differentially label MeA neurons that project to the VMH from MeA neurons that project to the BNST. These mice were exposed to a 30 min restraint stress. To measure FOS in the MeA after restraint stress, mice were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 10% formalin, and the brain was removed 2 h after the start of the restraint. Co-expression of the projection specific GFP or RFP and of FOS in the MeA was quantified to determine the response to stress in the MeA→VMH projection and in the MeA→BNST projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For polysynaptic circuit tracing of MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; to peripheral organs, Ai14 mice were injected with AAV1-Cre into the MeA. After 4-weeks to allow viral expression, mice were injected with PRV152-GFP into the liver. Seven days after the injection of the PRV-GFP, these mice were perfused, and the brains were collected. Co-expression of monosynpatic anterograde RFP expression from the MeA and of polysynaptic retrograde GFP expression from the liver was quantified in the VMH to determine the overlap of neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH and have a polysynaptic connection to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vglut2-cre&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vgat-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice were injected with a AAV9-hSyn-FLE-mGFP-2A-Synaptophysin-mRuby to determine cell-type specificity of MeA neurons that project to its downstream regions. Expression of mRuby in &lt;i&gt;Vglut2-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice was used to determine the proportion of glutamateric neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH, BNST, lateral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area. Expression of mRuby in &lt;i&gt;Vgat-cre&lt;/i&gt; mice was used to determine the proportion of GABAergic neurons that project from the MeA to the VMH, BNST, lateral hypothalamus and medial preoptic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Cell-type-specific chemogenetic activation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were injected with a AAV9-CaMKIIa-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, a AAV9-hDlx-GqDREADD-dTomato-Fishell-4, or a AAV9-hSyn-mCherry into the MeA. Mice were allowed 6 weeks for viral expression. For baseline glucose measurements after DREADD modulation, mice were fasted for 6 h, and tail vein samples for blood glucose were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 min after intraperitoneal injection of CNO (3 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The response to DREADD activation driven by the CAMKIIa promoter or driven by the Dlx promoter was compared to mCherry-expressing control mice to determine the contribution of excitatory or GABAergic neurons to changes in blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Tissue processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood glucose was determined using a Contour or Contour Next EZ glucometer (Bayer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood for plasma hormones was collected in an EDTA-coated tube (Sarstedt Microvette CB 300 K2E 16.444.100), spun for 10 min at 2,000 rpm, 4 °C, and plasma was separated and stored at −80 °C until assay. Plasma levels of insulin (Mercodia 10-1247-01), glucagon (Crystal Chem 81518), corticosterone (Crystal Chem 80556), adrenaline and noradrenaline (Abnova KA1877) were determined by ELISA. Liver glycogen was determined by colorimetric assay (Abcam ab169558). Circulating glycerol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic assay (Sigma-Aldrich TR0100). SpectraMax i3x, (Molecular Devices) with SoftMax Pro (v.7.1.2) were used for ELISA detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine protein levels or gene expression, liver was collected immediately after 30 min restraint or territorialized cage stress. For DREADD modulation studies, CNO was administered 60 min before the collection of liver tissue. MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; hM3DGq-expressing and corresponding control mice were unstressed. MeA&lt;sup&gt;VMH&lt;/sup&gt; hM4DGi and corresponding control mice were 4 h fasted and exposed to a 30 min restraint stress with liver tissue collected immediately after the restraint stress. Liver tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analysis, glycogen and protein analyses, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver tissue (~20 mg) was lysed in 600 µl buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% semi-dehydroascorbate) supplemented with halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Cell Signaling). Livers were first homogenized using Beadbug (Benchmark) and lysates were further sonicated in ice-cold water for 5 min. After centrifuging at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the protein supernatants were transferred to a new tube and protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Thirty micrograms of protein was mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer (BP-11R, Boston BioProducts) and boiled for 5 min before loading on SDS–PAGE. The Bio-Rad wet transfer system was used to transfer proteins for western blotting. PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and further incubated with primary antibodies (dilute in TBST with 3% BSA + 0.05% NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 4 °C overnight. PCK1 (ab70358), PGC1a (ab54481), FoxO1 (ab39670), GAPDH (ab9485) antibodies were from Abcam. G6PC (NBP1-80533) was from Novus Biologicals. All primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution. The membrane was washed 4 times in TBST with shaking for 10 min prior to incubation with secondary antibodies (HRP Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermofisher, 31460, 1: 10,000) and HRP Goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermofisher, 31430,1: 10,000 in TBST)) for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were washed 4 times in TBST with shaking for 10 min at room temperature. Membranes were further reacted with Pierce ECL western blotting substrate and imaged with iBright CL1500 (Thermofisher). Western blots were quantified by Image J (v.1.53k).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Quantitative PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from tissue by homogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by chloroform (Sigma) extraction and isolation using the RNeasy Plus Mini (Qiagen) kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Complimentary DNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 500 ng total RNA using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quantabio). The resulting cDNAs were diluted 1:10 then amplified by real-time PCR using the SYBR green system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Data were analysed with Quantstudio Design and Analysis software (v.1.5.2). All mRNA expression data were normalized to &lt;i&gt;Rpl23&lt;/i&gt; expression in the corresponding sample.

Immediately following the period of stimulation, the liver was collected and flash frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver tissue was collected to determine the flux through the gluconeogenic metabolic pathway by measuring how the stable isotope is incorporated into metabolites. Liver cells were isolated and incorporated into a media, collected to a screw vial, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following thawing on ice, 200 μl of the media was added to 800 μl of methanol. After a brief vortex, the media was centrifuged at 13,100&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial and dried under gentle nitrogen flow.

The samples were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC (8890)-MS (5977B), Agilent). The data was first processed with MassHunter software (v.10.2, Agilent). The mass-to-charge ratio used for the metabolites are 245 for fumarate, 465 for citrate, 335 for malate, 334 for aspartate, 445 for glycerol-3-phosphate, 160 for the glucose fragment of carbon position 1 and 2, and 319 for the glucose fragment of carbon 3 to carbon 6.

Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;White House abruptly fired the CDC director&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Susan Monarez, claiming that she did not “&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5474649-white-house-cdc-susan-monarez-firing/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMfM6ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFNa1ZudVFBUXNMU21HdVRqAR6if960QcJ-bTsx9bVdOwWvXmr2Kxk7Ghmq5coD4SiGJ9ktdMvrSKAHr456CA_aem_ADunaI9vqjdotZgT18EJLA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;align&lt;/a&gt;” with Donald Trump’s agenda.

In that letter, the staffers accused him of fueling harassment and violence directed at government healthcare staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the mounting pressure, Kennedy did not address Monarez’s firing, the subsequent resignations or the growing calls for his resignation in his editorial this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Kennedy defended the Trump administration’s role in what he described as “restoring public trust” in the CDC, which he argued had been “corroded” in recent years by “bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy, who previously founded an anti-vaccine group, also criticized the CDC’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it a “failure”, and blasted policies such as social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, and “the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-presidents-2026-health-care-agenda" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to testify before the Senate finance committee on Thursday for a hearing on Trump’s healthcare agenda, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/ahead-of-rfk-jr-appearance-before-finance-committee-wyden-demands-end-to-secrecy-and-stonewalling-at-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;committee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSEhEU3M0aUgzdHR2LXR3NDNMNnNSNzZXUWJJeWM5Nk5XTWI5SE9Fek9ETXBiMDFyZmliVklrYUJldTl4N2VFaUxPVVAxbjZzaHF0SFc2ZG1IcHo0bkViZVJITW5iVTNkWWNsTGM1RmR3TzNwZmpXZ1dOOEZsU2cweFpRY19GYW1CRlE</guid></item><item><title>性塑造双相情感障碍和精神分裂症的进程-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/schizophrenia-bipolar-sex-differences-29656/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large multicenter study has revealed that sex influences the course and characteristics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia tended to begin treatment later, while men with schizophrenia had the highest rates of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with bipolar disorder showed better functioning and cognitive performance than those with schizophrenia, with women scoring higher in verbal memory and psychomotor speed.

Sex differences are an area of growing interest in SMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to examine potential interactions between sex and diagnosis across a broad range of variables, to compare males and females within SZ and BD, and to investigate sex-specific group differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1516 individuals were included in a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the multicenter PsyCourse Study, including BD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 543), SZ (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 517), and healthy controls (HC) (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 456).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, neurocognitive performance, and somatic comorbidities were assessed. Generalized linear models were used to analyze differences between groups and sexes. False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant interactions were identified in age (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001), age at treatment (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05), illness duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), illicit drug use (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01), and smoking (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05). Differences in substance use were observed across groups and sexes, with the highest rates found in males with SZ. The BD group showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance compared with the SZ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the BD group, females reported better performance in verbal memory (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) and psychomotor speed (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than males. Moreover, both females and males with SMI showed higher rates of thyroid alterations compared with HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01 for females and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002 for males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant sex differences were observed in substance use and somatic comorbidities. Interactions between diagnosis and sex underscore the importance of considering both factors in clinical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need to tailor sex-specific treatment for each patient. Further research is needed to explore the role of sex hormones and other biological and societal factors in the presentation and course of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:57:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9tMS1MN1NyRTAxWnVtTUsyVzJsc1Zya0MwSmRaYnRDTmh6bjFwMlZrQy1weTE4RElzSk1PX2ZrQU1JV0djQ2k0bUtKVGFKS2VDWW92bVFSMXFtazV3REw0Mm5hNUFWUWE5MTJsZ0g0MEV6Slg2dkhmbUgyY2ZFdw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员指出可以在诊断前几年预测痴呆症的新症状- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15060917/Early-senseory-symptom-dementia-years-diagnosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing your sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs that you're developing dementia, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The memory-robbing illness, which affects the lives of millions, causes problems with memory, language and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But changes to our senses—which occur years before the devastating illness is formally diagnosed and appear to be unconnected—could be a key warning sign we are developing the life-shattering disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The German researchers found that this is because the immune system attacks vital nerve fibres linked to detecting scent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team looked at mice, as well as PET brain scans in living patients and post-mortem tissues from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-26a8fec0-88ab-11f0-8195-0fec413e30af" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice, they found early damage to the nerve fibres that link the olfactory bulb—the brain's scent hub—to the locus coeruleus that aids sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the PET scans confirmed the same pathway observed in the rodents was disrupted in living human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, the brain tissue samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients revealed the chemical changes that trick the immune system into destroying the fibres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fresh study suggests loss of sense of smell could be one of the earliest signs of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say these consistent &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62500-8#Sec10"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;, which were published in the journal Nature Communications, strongly show that losing your sense of smell is an early sign of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jochen Herms of the University of Munich said: 'Our findings could pave the way for earlier identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, he explained could 'enable them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical, as while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, other researchers &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798359/signs-dementia-memory-sensory-changes.html"&gt;found &lt;/a&gt;changes in sight, hearing, taste, touch and balance also strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned that problems with spatial awareness—for instance, standing too close to people—are also potential dementia warning signs which can occur up to twenty years before typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic symptoms of dementia include issues with memory, thinking speed, mental sharpness and quickness, language, understanding, judgement and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of  dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include the lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fresh findings follow research published just days ago that revealed a sense of purpose can lower your risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American scientists who published their findings in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry followed more than 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people with ah higher sense of purpose in life were 8 per cent less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective effect was seen even when factors like race, ethnicity, education, genetics and depression are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,' said Aliza Wingo, lead author of the study, and professor at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found those with higher purpose experienced cognitive decline on average 1.4 months later than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;One Teen’s Incredible “Mental Time Travel” Memory System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; recently published in a behavioral sciences journal describes a high school student’s hyperthymesia, an extraordinary ability to retrieve autobiographical memories. &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/teenager-with-hyperthymesia-exhibits-extraordinary-mental-time-travel-abilities"&gt;Teenager With Hyperthymesia Exhibits Extraordinary Mental Time Travel Abilities&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of the study, referred to as TL, was a 17-year-old high school student in France when she came to the researchers’ attention. She had long known her memory was different. As a child, she would casually mention her ability to mentally revisit past events to check for details, only to be accused of lying by her peers. Eventually, she disclosed this ability to her family at age 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL’s recollections were not merely accurate — they were structured. She described a highly organized internal world where memories were stored in a large, rectangular “white room” with a low ceiling. Within this mental space, personal memories were arranged thematically. Sections were dedicated to family life, vacations, friends, and even her collection of soft toys. Each toy had its own memory tag, including information about when and from whom it was received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these recollections were not purely factual. They carried emotional weight and vivid perceptual details. TL could mentally relive events from both her original perspective and from an outside observer’s view. She described, for instance, her first day of school in striking detail: what she wore, the weather, and the precise visual memory of her mother watching her through the fence. These experiences were accompanied by a strong sense of re-experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. The paper’s authors refer to her abilities as “mental time travel”. And this is straight out of Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY"&gt;Inside Out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory storage, TL described three additional rooms in her internal world, each associated with specific emotional functions. A cold “pack ice” room helped her cool down when angry. A “problems room” was empty but served as a space for pacing and thinking. A more uncomfortable “military room,” associated with her father’s absence due to military service, was linked to guilt. These features suggest a broader internal architecture shaped by emotional needs and reflective processes, not just memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My memory does not work like this and it’s always fascinating to discover how other people think and perceive the world; see &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/23/10/does-your-brain-picture-things"&gt;Does Your Brain Picture Things?&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.damninteresting.com"&gt;damn interesting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Left unmanaged, it can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney damage. While medication remains essential for many patients, lifestyle changes, especially diet, can make a significant difference. Beetroot juice is emerging as one such simple, at-home remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with dietary nitrates that turn into nitric oxide in your body, this bright-red juice relaxes blood vessels and can significantly lower systolic blood pressure, sometimes by as much as 7-12 mmHg, as per clinical trials. According to a recent study, drinking beetroot juice daily may help lower high blood pressure naturally, thanks to its high concentration of nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. This compound relaxes and widens blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with any health trend, it’s important to understand both the benefits and the risks. For example, too much nitrate or oxalate may pose risks, especially to kidney health, if not prepared with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一种古老的疾病再次卷土重来- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/03/g-s1-86671/cholera-diarrhea-disease-africa</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Action is needed, not tomorrow, but really now," said Yap Boum of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's talking about a disease that has been around for centuries — cholera — and is rearing its head again in Africa. Over the past three years, cases have more than doubled, with over 230,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths so far this year on the continent. Those cases are spread across 23 countries, up from 15 affected countries in 2022, according to Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a disease that is easily treatable — yet deadly. It can kill someone in a matter of hours if good medical care is not provided promptly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The rising numbers brought African leaders to Lusaka, Zambia, where last week they announced an emergency plan and presidential task force to combat the severe diarrheal infection. The &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Weekly-Bulletin-31-Aug-2025-ENG.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new plan&lt;/a&gt; is a joint effort between Africa CDC and the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO, in a situation report on cholera &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON579" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that the situation "continues to deteriorate, driven by conflict and poverty." It said cholera is "resurging in a number of countries, including some that had not reported substantial case numbers in years, like Chad and the Republic of Congo." Particularly worrisome is that in half a dozen countries over 1% of patients are dying of cholera, "indicating serious gaps in case management and delayed access to care," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection comes from consuming water or food contaminated by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;. Boum says an important part of the new initiative is that it is happening at the presidential level. That allows coordination across countries, as well as across multiple ministries within a country, such as those involved in water infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The actual driver, which is the access to clean water, is not the mandate of the Ministry of Health. So what is changing now is to bring the issue of cholera at the highest level, at the presidential level," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With an estimated budget of $231 million, the emergency plan is focused on the next six months. This includes over 350 cholera treatment centers and hundreds of outpatient treatment locations. An estimated 10 million oral cholera vaccine doses will be needed, and the costs associated with the vaccine will be covered by donations. Boum said one of the mandates of the task force is to mobilize resources for this effort.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The plan's long-term goal is to eliminate cholera as a major public health issue by 2030 — a lofty aim for an ancient infection. Here is what you need to know about this old scourge that's still causing suffering today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera's origins are in India.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been in the Ganges delta from time immemorial," says &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/603/david-sack" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Sack&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who's spent much of his career studying the disease. Cholera began spreading from India throughout the West in the early 1800s with more global trade and travel by ships, he explains. Soon there were cases cropping up all the way from Russia and Western Europe to U.S. cities, including Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a disease that affected large parts of the world," Sack says. With a fatality rate of about 50% if untreated, it killed millions of people as it spread across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At that time, we didn't know what caused it," he says. "We didn't know how to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theories about the cause of the illness were plentiful. The leading suspect was the foul air rising from sewers and piles of rotting trash in cities; poison from the soil was another possible culprit. Others looked higher up for a cause: Some faith leaders said it was retribution by God for sinful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the theories had a common thread, though. There appeared to be a link between cholera and overcrowded urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in the 1850s, an English doctor named John Snow became a legend of public health for figuring out that an outbreak in the Soho neighborhood of London was linked to a single drinking water source. Snow is credited with stopping the raging outbreak, which claimed 10,000 lives across London, by removing the handle from the Broad Street water pump.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Snow argued correctly that water contaminated with sewage was spreading the illness from one resident to another. But he still didn't know exactly what the water was contaminated with; at the time, the pathogen that caused cholera hadn't yet been discovered. He theorized that it might be tiny parasites or germs or some "poison" able to reproduce in the water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Italian scientist Filippo Pacini identified the bacteria that cause cholera. But his discovery wouldn't be widely accepted for decades — and in the meantime, millions more died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast killer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One thing that makes cholera notorious is its speed. The severe gastrointestinal disease can trigger so much diarrhea and vomiting that patients can rapidly become dehydrated. They can lose so much fluid that their internal organs shut down. This can happen over the course of days or just hours.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, there are 1.3 million to 4 million cases and between 21,000 and 143,000 deaths from cholera each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cases crop up throughout the world, particularly when a crisis or conflict strikes and clean drinking water is not available. And Africa has been particularly hard hit, currently accounting for 82% of global cases and nearly 94% of cholera-related deaths, according to Africa CDC. Cholera often spreads when someone ingests water or food that has been contaminated by the bacteria, which can enter the water from the diarrhea of someone who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Climate and conflict&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two main types of cholera outbreaks: those that circulate within countries where outbreaks happen regularly and those that begin spiraling out of control during a crisis, such as a conflict or natural disaster like a flood or an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In war zones like Ukraine, the breakdown of water, sanitation and health infrastructure means that the introduction of cholera can spread rapidly — and disastrously.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As those infrastructure systems crumble in conflict, we can have sewage contamination of our water supply, and then our water supply can be a vehicle to transmit cholera," says &lt;a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/people/faculty/daniele-lantagne" target="_blank"&gt;Daniele Lantagne&lt;/a&gt;, a research professor at the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During its ongoing civil war, for example, Yemen has had the worst cholera outbreak in recorded history with more than 2.5 million cases and around 4,000 deaths, according to the United Nations' &lt;a href="https://www.iom.int/news/acute-diarrhea-and-cholera-outbreak-yemen-exacerbated-decade-conflict-iom-warns" target="_blank"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;. In Chad, the cholera outbreak is driven by the conflict in neighboring Sudan. "You have the mass refugee influx, which leads to overcrowding [in] the camp with unsafe water and sanitation," says Boum. "Whether we are in Ethiopia, in Sudan, in Chad, you always see how the humanitarian crisis is fueling those cholera outbreaks. There is no health without peace."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, natural disasters — which can affect clean water supply — are becoming more common due to climate change. Floods, for example, pollute water, while drought dries up safe drinking water sources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That puts people fleeing areas destroyed by climate disasters at higher risk of exposure to cholera. "Any time you get people moving around, and people having to use water that is not their normal water supply, there's likely to be a risk," says &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/603/david-sack" target="_blank"&gt;Sack&lt;/a&gt;, the professor of international health at Johns Hopkins.. People on the move may end up drinking contaminated water from rivers or other water sources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in places where cholera is newly emerging or remerging, people have little to no immunity from prior cases or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Souped-up sugar water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The good news about cholera is that treatment is actually very simple: It's rehydration," Lantagne says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera is a treatable disease — as long as the patient gets medical attention quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A patient with cholera should never die," Sack says. "If they get to a treatment center in time, if they still have a breath, we can save their life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Treatment consists of simply keeping the person hydrated. If they are capable of drinking, they can be treated with oral rehydration fluids — basically &lt;a href="http://rehydrate.org/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;souped-up sugar water&lt;/a&gt;, like Pedialyte. This strategy works in about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt; of cholera cases. In more severe cases, the patient may need to be given fluids intravenously alongside antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If cholera is treated quickly — within hours, before a patient's health declines — fewer than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/general/index.html#:~:text=With%20prompt%20appropriate%20rehydration%2C%20fewer,should%20seek%20medical%20attention%20promptly." target="_blank"&gt;1%&lt;/a&gt; of patients die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cholera is also fairly easy to identify. Patients have distinctive stool that is yellowish or whitish — kind of like the color of water that rice is cooked in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there are rapid tests that can check for suspected cases in individuals even before a laboratory confirms an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also three vaccines that can be administered in areas where cholera occurs regularly or when an epidemic begins to take root. Between 1997 and 2012 just 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines were used worldwide, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-05-2018-largest-cholera-vaccine-drive-in-history-to-target-spike-in-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, WHO says that number jumped to over 10 million doses. And in 2023, some 35 million doses were used, says &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/meet-global-oral-cholera-vaccine-stockpile" target="_blank"&gt;Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the vaccine supply is sometimes inadequate, mainly because it has not been a funding priority for other countries. "We don't have enough [vaccines] for every place," Sack says. And it is difficult to venture into conflict zones, like the one in Ukraine, to vaccinate people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2013, however, Gavi established a cholera vaccine stockpile. Any country can request to use these reserves if it's experiencing a cholera outbreak. "Cholera is certainly the stockpile that's used the most," says Allyson Russell, the senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security at Gavi. This year, as of July, she says, "we've sent 30 million doses of cholera emergency vaccines to 12 countries."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The vaccines are given orally, are easy to administer and cost less than $5 a dose to produce and deliver, according to Africa CDC. That means that with enough resources, everyone at risk could be vaccinated. The challenge of providing people with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/08/28/g-s1-85967/water-drink-safe-sanitation-toilet" target="_blank"&gt;safe water and good sanitation&lt;/a&gt; is far more costly but also key to preventing outbreaks. Without it, cholera persists even after an epidemic begins to slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“No matter what happens with [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] and the federal government, we are going to make sure vaccines remain available in Massachusetts,” Healey said in a statement Wednesday. “We are working to ensure that all pharmacies make the vaccine available as soon as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Healey has also touted the state as a leader in an effort to create a regional public health collaboration with other Northeast states, including every New England state except New Hampshire, that would rely on medical societies rather than the CDC for guidance in establishing vaccination policies. On Wednesday, California, Washington, and Oregon announced the creation of a similar “health alliance” to shape immunization policies for those three states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of vaccine skepticism and peddling false information, has upended  the CDC since entering office and has pushed policies that are at odds with  scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, an independent board that advises the CDC on vaccine policy, and replacing them with less qualified people, many of whom share his anti-vaccine or vaccine skeptical ideology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Removing children and pregnant women from the CDC’s immunization schedule for COVID. An independent review this month found young unvaccinated children are vulnerable to serious illness from COVID, and newborns can inherit meaningful immune protections from mothers who get COVID shots while carrying babies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canceling $500 million in federal funding to research new mRNA vaccines and treatments. MRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna saved millions of lives during the  pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommending thimerosal, a preservative, be removed from all vaccines. The CDC’s&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html"&gt; own web site&lt;/a&gt; states thimerosal, used in some flu vaccine, is not harmful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last week, he fired the CDC’s director for refusing to fire top officials or rubber stamp decisions from  his hand-picked advisory committee. Three high-level CDC officials resigned in protest, warning that Kennedy had compromised the agency’s credibility. They warned that Kennedy appeared poised to move beyond COVID vaccines to restrict access to immunizations more widely. Wednesday, more than 1,000 current and former CDC staffers urged Kennedy to resign over his vaccination policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, the United States  experienced its worst measles outbreak in three decades this year, almost entirely driven by infections in people who are not vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University who specializes in public health, welcomed the standing order. Until the state issued it, she said, Massachusetts – despite its reputation for being at the vanguard in public health – was making it hard if not impossible for people to get the new booster approved by the FDA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As she herself found out when she tried to get the booster the past few days, she said, primary care doctors have largely shunted responsibility for administering COVID shots to pharmacies, because physicians are swamped with patients seeking other care. But the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy forbids pharmacists from administering COVID shots without the authorization of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you can’t get it at a pharmacy and you can’t get it at a doctor’s office, you can’t get it,” said Parmet, who was eligible for the shot because she is over the age of 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Not only did the state say that pharmacists could now administer the booster shots without the CDC panel’s authorization, Parmet noted, the Healey administration broadened the group of people who could receive it. .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What they’re trying to do is increase accessibility beyond what the FDA envisioned or suggested,” she said. “This looks like it’s going to address the problem and reassert our leadership in public health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The governor’s standing order authorized pharmacists to administer two Moderna booster vaccines: mNEXSPIKE for people 12 and older and Spikevax for people 5 and older. It also authorized Pfizer’s Comirnaty for people five and older and Novavax’s Nuvaxoid for people 12 and older.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children younger than 5 typically receive vaccines at their pediatrician’s offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a breaking story and will be updated. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Unless you also ditch men entirely, going off birth control means it's statistically &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; likelier that you're going to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look no further than a Texas-based young woman named Ashley Hamrick, who recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/style/birth-control-skepticism-wellness-tiktok.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about her decision to go off her birth control pills, after more than a decade taking them, when she ran across a corner of social media full of glowing, anti-pill influencers advising her to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamrick, aged 26 when she stopped taking the pill, began to wonder whether birth control pills were right for her while watching these beatific young women talking about how much clearer their minds felt following their decision to stop using prescription contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who am I without birth control?" she recalled pondering to the &lt;em&gt;NYT.&lt;/em&gt;  "Will I feel some sort of difference coming off it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perturbed, the young woman's doctor told her that if she wasn't having any negative side effects — which, as Hamrick told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, she wasn't — there was no reason to go off the pill. Instead of heeding that advice, she felt dismissed by the doctor, and decided to sit down with her partner, Ken Contreras, who she'd been with less than a year at the time, to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though neither felt ready to be parents, Contreras ultimately decided that his partner's choice was the most important thing to consider. So Hamrick stopped taking the pill, and the couple didn't begin using any different method to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months of non-contraceptive sex later, nature took its course, and Hamrick got pregnant — and it couldn't have happened at a worse time in recent political history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early months of her pregnancy in 2024, Hamrick watched in horror as Texas continued enacting its draconian post-&lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; agenda, not only banning abortion in almost all scenarios but also, due to the confusing letter of the law, all but cosigned the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/27/texas-abortion-death-porsha-ngumezi/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;deaths of mothers&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the lives of their fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrified of such an outcome, the couple began considering leaving the Longhorn State — and perhaps even the country — for their safety. Thinking about that very real possibility, Hamrick felt "despondent," as she told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Am I depressed?" she wondered during that terrifying time. "Do I really feel like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those hard feelings didn't end with political anxiety. During her maternity leave, while Hamrick was stuck at home and her partner went off to work, she found herself frustrated and isolated as she watched him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was taking it out on him," Hamrick told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. "My whole life felt on pause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her maternity leave complete, Hamrick is now reckoning with the experience of being a young mother. While many of these so-called "&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/style/trump-maga-women.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;wellness influencers&lt;/a&gt;" preach against birth control and the ways it "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ratedlaur/video/7294334071285746986?q=birth%20control&amp;amp;t=1756844373504" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt;" their bodies, very few post honestly about the realities that accompany a lack of contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Hamrick, those realities came hard and fast, first with getting pregnant and then experiencing anxiety, depression, and anger while she handled a pregnancy she wasn't ready for. She's also gone on antidepressants, another target of the &lt;a href="https://atmos.earth/wellness-culture-is-now-peddling-extremism/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;faux-wellness right wing&lt;/a&gt;, including health secretary &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/government-take-away-ssris" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Robert F.

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm sure you've seen displays of "male enhancement" products at your local gas station, liquor store, or head shop. With brand names like "Rhino Power 4000," "Black Mamba," or "X Rated Honey," these "herbal" or "all natural" supplements boast that they will "increase stamina," give you "rock hard power," and "add inches." The packaging may not state it directly, but the overall message is extremely clear: These pills treat erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're like me, you've seen these pills and thought, "These would never work." Well, my skeptical friend, this week &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the ones who are wrong. Gas station boner pills often work exactly as expected—but this isn't because herbal ingredients like ginseng and Yohimbe bark are miracle cures for ED. It's because many of these pills are basically mislabeled Viagra or Cialis. It's true: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; has found all kinds of prescription medication in hundreds of different shady "supplements," but you can still buy them. You shouldn't, but you can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a rack full of unlicensed prescription pills came to be easily available at your local 7-11 is a twisty story. Most of these "supplements" originate in foreign factories, especially in China and India, where pharmaceutical manufacturing is cheaper and less tightly regulated. From there, they are distributed as "dietary supplements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements don’t have to be tested by the Food and Drug Administration before they're sold, so anyone who wants to make a quick buck can fill some capsules with dried grass, call it a supplement, and start selling it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-fda-and-supplement-whack-a-mole"&gt;The FDA and supplement whack-a-mole&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, hiding the active ingredients in Viagra and Cialis in what you call a supplement is against the law, but the FDA doesn't have enforcement power until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the sale. If people get sick or someone complains, the Feds can step in, but not before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To its credit, the FDA steps in frequently. The agency maintains an ever-updated database of problematic "&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud-notifications/sexual-enhancement-and-energy-product-notifications" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Sexual Enhancement and Energy Products,&lt;/a&gt;" where you can read all about the illicit ingredients in supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-green-lumber-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Green Lumber&lt;/a&gt; (contains tadalafil, the active ingredient in Cialis), &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/himgo-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;HimGo&lt;/a&gt; (contains sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, and diclofenac, an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug), and "&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/versace-real-honey-men-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Versace Real Honey&lt;/a&gt;" (sildenafil, tadalafil, and acetaminophen). The FDA even prosecutes people occasionally for selling this stuff, like Jacksonville "business executive" Jae Hong Kim who &lt;a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2025/06/27/maker-of-2-million-male-enhancement-pills-pleads-to-misbranding-meds/84344398007/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;recently pled guilty&lt;/a&gt; to selling prescription drugs marketed as “Rhino 69” and “MegaZen Power 5000.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kim's story is the exception, not the rule. The FDA may pull Mega-Mamba Mojo pills from the market, but in a few weeks, your local gas station will be selling Lightning Lad Libido pills instead, maybe from the same shell company, but now with a different name. These pills can be produced for pennies and sold for up to $20 per, so the risk/reward ratio is solid for people who sell the stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

&lt;h2 id="why-you-should-not-take-male-enhancement-products-from-gas-stations"&gt;Why you should not take male "enhancement" products from gas stations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't take erection pills from a gas station; first, because you don't need to be &lt;em&gt;enhanced&lt;/em&gt;; you're beautiful how you are, King. But if you're treating erectile dysfunction, you can do better than a shady supplement. Taking strange pills from a gas station is a bad idea for a lot of reasons, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown dosage&lt;/strong&gt;: Even if you know it's sildenafil, you have no idea how much you’re taking, but it's usually "a crap-ton." FDA tests of these products have found amounts of prescription drugs well above what a doctor would order, and that often leads to severe headaches, low blood pressure, dizziness, vision changes, or even heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangerous interactions&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re on heart meds, blood pressure drugs, or nitrates, ED drugs are generally not safe. For that matter, if you're on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; drug they're generally not safe, because literally any drug could be in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomness:&lt;/strong&gt; Lack of honest labeling means that you might get Ginkgo Biloba when you're hoping for Viagra, and vice-versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of confiding in the guy behind the counter at your local head shop, talk to your doctor. They have heard it before, and the prices of real-deal E.D. are usually better than the gas station equivalent. It's $2 to $10 per pill for generic sildenafil (Viagra) and about $6 to $18 per pill for generic tadalafil (Cialis), where gas station drugs can cost as much as $20 per dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-they-still-sell"&gt;Why they still sell &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these pills are dangerous, expensive, and shady, and the FDA constantly warns us not to take them. Why are they still &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;? First because the minimal oversight of dietary supplements has been baked into law since the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)&lt;/a&gt; passed in 1994. But also because these pills offer both an easy solution and an illicit thrill. The combination of curiosity, desperation, and sheepishness makes those shiny packages by the slushie machine an irresistible impulse purchase to some, especially people who are too shy to discuss medical issues with their doctors. So they keep selling because impulse, embarrassment, and weak regulation all collide, and the result is a product that’s as easy to get as it is risky to take. &lt;/p&gt;

If anything, they just got worse. Then, the coughing started—which the mother-of-three thought was the so-called hundred day cough that ran rampage last winter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until she began experiencing breathlessness a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-20bb5730-8813-11f0-b761-7f9717a666fb"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; that she thought it could be something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken on December 20 revealed that she had a significant amount of fluid in her lungs, which doctors were concerned could be a warning sign of blood cancer —and what would be an incurable diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, her haematologist mentioned that around half of patients diagnosed with a different type of cancer, called thymoma—a rare type of cancer that starts in the thymus gland in between the lungs—also have an autoimmune disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve thought she was suffering from common digestive issues when she was unable to finish her meal whilst on holiday with her family in October half term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve (pictured left) with her children Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to the GP who gave her antacids to ease her symptoms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Even still, her doctors' primary concern was blood cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the heartbreaking ordeal, Ms Fanning told the Daily Mail: 'When they detected fluid in my lungs and said they'd need to start treatment immediately my heart sunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Two of my children have birthdays in January, so after my biopsy, I ran around trying to get the last bits together—balloons and presents—the call came two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On January 4 I was told I likely had blood cancer and that they had a bed for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was heartbreaking having to explain to my children that I wasn't going to be there for them. They watched from the window as I left, crying their eyes out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten days later, Ms Fanning was discharged from hospital whilst doctors waited on test results to confirm whether it was blood cancer or in fact thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I asked what my prognosis was, I was told I would just have to be patient and wait for the results. It was horrendous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Devastatingly, the tests confirmed stage four thymoma that had spread to the lining of her lungs, meaning it was incurable—an avoidable prognosis had it been caught earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only in December when she started experiencing breathlessness alongside a persistent cough that she thought it could be something more serious &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to A&amp;amp;E and was immediately referred for scans which revealed fluid in her lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Given her symptoms, doctors were concerned that she could have blood cancer which had spread to the lining of her lungs - an incurable prognosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve was admitted for scans and a biopsy that same day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now Ms Fanning is doing everything she can to see her three children—Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2— grow up, despite being told that palliative chemotherapy, which would give her two years at most, was the only option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other cancers, experts do not know exactly causes thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus is a gland in the chest, between the lungs, which produces and releases hormones and helps the body fight off infections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is thought that people diagnosed with thymoma are more likely to also have an autoimmune disease—which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus gland helps keeps the immune system functioning properly, which may explain the link between autoimmune disease and thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being diagnosed with oral lichen planus a year earlier—an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin which lines the inside of the mouth—after suffering from painful mouth ulcers, the link with thymoma was never mentioned until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning started chemotherapy just over a week later on February 14 2025, but after just one round she was told the dose was too high and her body was struggling to cope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point she weighed just over 6 stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending 10 days in hospital, Maeve was discharged without treatment as doctors waited on the results of further scans which would confirm her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After an agonising wait, Maeve was eventually diagnosed with stage four thymoma - a rare but aggressive type of cancer which forms in the thymus gland between the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heartbreakingly, Maeve was given a very bleak prognosis of two years at most and was told that palliative care was the only option &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve also suffers from a rare autoimmune disease which has been linked with thymoma &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her oncologists reduced the dose and despite responding well to the first three rounds, the treatment had stopped working by round five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now undergoing second line chemotherapy every three weeks to try and keep the cancer under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has paired her medical treatment with complimentary private treatment in the form of  hyperthermia—which works by heating body tissue to help damage and kill cancer cells—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, curcumin infusions and light therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments—which were recommended to her by her nutritionist who specialises in cancer care—will hopefully alter her diagnosis and help her beat cancer for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning added: 'These treatments are life changing, and in some cases have seen people's cancer regress from stage four to earlier stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me its too early to say but I want to do absolutely everything I can to ensure I am alive to see by beautiful children grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was diagnosed, my youngest was just 18 months old and at the time I wasn't sure if Christmas 2024 would be my last with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a horrendous situation, every mother's worst nightmare and this is why I need to do everything I can to ensure I am still with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together with her friends and family Ms Fanning has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jgux5c-help-maeve?"&gt;GoFundMe Page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover the costs of her treatment which sees her travel down to London twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have so far raised around £42,000 which she hopes will see her through until Christmas. Altogether her treatments cost around £11,000 a month—a cost she could never cover alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now due to start proton beam therapy at University College London Hospital later this month which uses high energy proton beams to treat very rare types of cancers close to vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:56:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNOTdVNzNkN3JybzduQThteWFzX2dZZklFLTNIalBjRGxJYlBVQjFCc3RHSTdRMUoxYm13cUFjNEJ3RU53X0hvc0QxNmltVXJxTUFUQ3ZJMlU4N2hNZ0x2c2xYTlJtNXFmaFh1ZFZWMUNITEVXc3ZoS2RNcnFXVFIxQmJER0RNbmY5YlROYlMzMjhqUnNTOUIxM09RQzFsUDRVMmNJTkdOb9IBrAFBVV95cUxQN0xlLVQ0Y2xyV1pjcUQtblNtS3Rnb24yTGlvLVJlVkY3WDdBcmtEc2FJWHFXZDZWMDhpb1NYX2tyTFN1WTY4YU1Mci1BR3BjdDMtbWQyUkpmSlJjVTRtWHQ4WmotLTZSaFJCbzN2b0ZvRjgzYzVwNkwtc2hSN0JZdjFfVEFaNzkta1VQRXZObGcweUJxMHVnUXZoaHhmUXZiaWVkUWFXaUJmSFlf</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品—是时候改进定义了-大自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="js-context-bar-sticky-point-mobile" data-track-context="article body"&gt;

These fats are mainly produced industrially. They clog up arteries, increasing people’s risk of a heart attack or death. Some 60 countries are already on a path to eliminating these fats and the World Health Organization has certified that 9 have removed industrially produced trans fats from their food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating these fats will be a win. However, a coalition of public-health researchers and institutions in Europe and in low- and middle-income countries is urging countries to ensure that the language of the UN declaration refers specifically to industrially produced trans fats, which it doesn’t at present. This is because trans fats also occur in natural products, such as milk and other dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02750-0/d41586-025-02750-0_51412508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter coordinated by the International Livestock Research Institute, a non-profit organization based in Addis Ababa, and backed by the African Union, signatories say that nations need to be careful that the proposal does not inadvertently discourage foods that are important for nutrition, especially in poor countries. They are making an important point. Researchers have a responsibility to push for accuracy and precision and to reduce the possibility of unintended consequences in public-health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate about trans fats feeds into a broader argument in the dietary science and policy field that is similarly rising up the global agenda. Industrially produced &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02451-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02451-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;trans fats are a common component of ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; — an umbrella term for products that are made using industrial ingredients and food extracts with additives. These food products are often high in salt, sugar and saturated fats. Latin America has been leading the world both in drawing attention to ultra-processed foods and in taking action to discourage their production and consumption given accumulating evidence of the links such products have to obesity and cardiovascular disease&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are an active area of study, but researchers are also debating what the term means and how to reduce the risk that its use will have unintended consequences&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was described in a 2009 paper by Carlos Monteiro, a nutrition researcher at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Foods are categorized using a scale (called the NOVA classification system) that groups them according to the extent, type and reason of processing (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4nbza72" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4nbza72" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4nbza72&lt;/a&gt;). At one end are minimally processed items that require relatively little processing, such as frozen vegetables and pasta. At the other end are ultra-processed foods, which contain products that you won’t find in most kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02451-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02750-0/d41586-025-02750-0_51412506.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods could make it harder to lose weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study and the NOVA scale have had a considerable impact on health policy. The classification system, which is recognized by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, has pushed many governments to develop strong public-health policies, often despite organized and sustained opposition from food conglomerates. Latin American countries, for example, are mandating warning labels and levying taxes on food products that are high in salt, sugar and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as we report in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a News Feature&lt;/a&gt;, some researchers say that the NOVA scale has its limitations, because processing is only one factor that explains why people eat such foods and what effects they have on the body. Dietary habits are also influenced by palatability — there is some evidence that people are attracted to products that are easy to consume, such as soft-textured or fast foods, or include ingredients that can increase cravings. The number of calories per portion (energy density) also influences people’s dietary habits. Another difficulty with the scale is that the ultra-processed category also includes some varieties of bread and baby formula as well as hot dogs and chicken nuggets, even though the reasons for processing each of these products are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03796-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02750-0/d41586-025-02750-0_51412504.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Too easy to swallow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers of the NOVA system agree that the act of processing on its own is not the issue, and that some forms — milk pasteurization to remove bacteria, for example, or the chilling or freezing of vegetables to prolong shelf life — are beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and regulatory bodies need to be more aware of these issues, and there is a need to clarify the definition of ultra-processed foods and reduce the unintended effects of using a vague term. US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, one of the strongest critics of ultra-processed foods, has issued a call for a uniform definition so that there is consistency in research and policy. In the United Kingdom, the country’s main research funder, UK Research and Innovation, has commissioned several studies to test public awareness of and attitudes towards these foods, the results of which are &lt;a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/opinions-on-ultra-processed-foods-being-sought/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ukri.org/news/opinions-on-ultra-processed-foods-being-sought/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;due to be reported next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2009 study shone a much-needed spotlight on dietary changes, including the replacement of conventionally prepared meals with industrially produced foods. But there is a spectrum of dietary issues worldwide: obesity is a growing problem, but so is a lack of access to sufficient calories. This means that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. Government intervention must ensure that the worst excesses of industrial food production are reined in, while ensuring the availability of appropriate food for all.&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, has puzzled doctors for years. Nearly four million Americans and more than 30 million people worldwide live with this condition, yet treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional heart failure, where the heart muscle weakens and struggles to pump, HFpEF looks normal on scans. The heart still pushes blood forward, but it cannot relax and fill properly between beats. That stiffness makes you feel short of breath, drained of energy, and sometimes swollen in the legs, belly, or lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was thought to be the primary culprit. But a new idea challenges that view. According to Milton Packer, MD, Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center and Visiting Professor at Imperial College London, the real driver may not be the heart at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team suggests that signals coming from fat tissue could be behind much of the disease. Their theory, called the Adipokine Hypothesis, was published in &lt;em&gt;JACC&lt;/em&gt; and presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central illustration: Lines of evidence supporting the Adipokine Hypothesis of HFpEF. (CREDIT: Packer M, JACC 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat as a Messenger, Not Just Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people picture fat as little more than stored calories. In reality, fat is a living organ that sends out chemical messages across the body. These messengers, called adipokines, are proteins and hormones that can influence your heart, blood vessels, metabolism, and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fat is healthy, adipokines protect organs, reduce inflammation, and help control fluid balance. But when fat becomes excessive and unhealthy, the signals change. Harmful adipokines are released in higher amounts while the protective ones decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in fat biology, Packer explains, transforms fat into an organ that drives stress, inflammation, and scarring inside the heart. “Up to now, there has been no unifying hypothesis to explain HFpEF. That has resulted in significant misunderstanding and a lack of direction in both diagnosis and therapy,” he said. “This bold new framework helps to identify the true cause of HFpEF in most people. That should make an enormous difference in guiding effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Fat Signals Disrupt the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new framework outlines several ways that adipokines from unhealthy fat might set HFpEF in motion. One route is inflammation. When fat tissue becomes stressed, it attracts immune cells that release even more inflammatory chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules damage blood vessel linings and heart muscle cells. Another pathway is vascular stiffness. Arteries lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to move and raising pressure inside the heart. Over time, scarring—or fibrosis—sets in. That scar-like tissue prevents the heart from relaxing and filling properly. Add in metabolic stress from conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, and the cycle accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a heart that seems to pump normally but fails to deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs during exertion. Climbing a flight of stairs may suddenly feel exhausting, not because the heart cannot squeeze, but because it cannot fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis: Secretion of Adipokines From Biologically Transformed Visceral Adipose Tissue Leads to HFpEF. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strong Evidence Builds the Case&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis pulls together findings from many different fields. Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart. Adipose tissue can secrete a broad array of molecules and cellular constituents that can act in an endocrine or paracrine manner to exert favorable or deleterious effects on the heart. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer stresses that body mass index, or BMI, is a poor guide because it is influenced by muscle and bone. Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains. In healthy people, adipocytes primarily secrete Domain I adipokines, with minimal secretion of Domain II adipokines and with suppression of Domain III adipokines. In people with visceral adiposity or obesity, adipose tissue secretes primarily Domain III adipokines, with suppression of Domain I adipokines. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis is still a theory, not a proven fact. Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades. By tackling fat as an active organ, science may open new doors for prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/beta-blockers-cardiac-jacks-of-all-trades"&gt;Millions of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; take &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems, especially after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies suggest that for many patients, these drugs may no longer be helpful – and in some cases, they could even be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta blockers work to lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the oxygen demands of the heart. Traditionally, they've been prescribed after a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; (myocardial infarction) to give the heart time to heal and reduce the risk of a second attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-cancer-strikes-very-rarely-an-expert-reveals-why"&gt;Heart Cancer Strikes Very Rarely. An Expert Reveals Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the catch: since beta blockers were introduced more than four decades ago, modern medical care approaches (including &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761"&gt;stents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/how-statin-drugs-protect-the-heart"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt;) have dramatically improved recovery after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many hearts rebound better than they once did. For women whose hearts recover well, the new research suggests that beta blockers may do more harm than good – increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-takeaway-food-packaging-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta blockers have long been a foundational treatment after acute myocardial&lt;br&gt;
infarction; their use was initially supported by the results of early randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in one of their published papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1730"&gt;these trials&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in an era that predates what is now modern standard care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether beta blockers still make sense today, scientists in Spain and Italy studied 8,438 patients across 109 healthcare centers who had survived a heart attack and had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; (EF) above 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normal EF – a measure of how efficiently the heart pumps blood– is 55–70 percent; below 40 percent indicates significant dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of the patients were treated with beta blockers in addition to standard care, while the other half were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an average of 3.7 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference between these groups in rates of a second &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, hospitalization for heart failure, or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran the numbers on just the 1,627 women – a group who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women on beta blockers actually fared worse, with higher risks of complications and death. The risk was greatest in women whose hearts had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;recovered the best&lt;/a&gt; and in those taking the highest doses. This pattern did not appear in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg" alt="Beta-blocker chart" class="wp-image-172873 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-528x415.jpg 528w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta blockers showed no improvements in health outcomes in the study cohort.

The heart still pushes blood forward, but it cannot relax and fill properly between beats. That stiffness makes you feel short of breath, drained of energy, and sometimes swollen in the legs, belly, or lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was thought to be the primary culprit. But a new idea challenges that view. According to Milton Packer, MD, Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center and Visiting Professor at Imperial College London, the real driver may not be the heart at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team suggests that signals coming from fat tissue could be behind much of the disease.

Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="shifting_the_way_doctors_think"&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart.

Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="treatments_may_already_be_here"&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains.

Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades.

Simple carbs include food items like white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. When eaten, these break down quickly into glucose, thus causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. However, when we have complex carbs-- like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables-- they are digested slowly due to their high fiber content. And so, they slowly release glucose, thus providing steady energy, preventing sudden sugar spikes, and improving insulin sensitivity over time.

Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi’s tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi’s claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi’s $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bi’s husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn’t blame him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Smith had planned&lt;/span&gt; to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn’t stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn’t breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith’s HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Smith hadn’t heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who’d had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon’s corpse to Smith’s 7-year-old son’s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;In the months&lt;/span&gt; after Leon died, Bi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump’s “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon’s due date. Posted Leon’s ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted links disclosing Smith’s full name, photo, address, employer, mortgage license number, and son’s first name to her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe hyVpEN callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby Leon’s empty crib.&lt;/p&gt;

She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I’m not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it’s up to them to disclose. One of Bi’s fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it’s not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn’t just Leon’s death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman’s body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU3FOeG1jSkVJTFBtXzR6U3FmeUp1UlRnVEpzM0VHeUlxbEpaVjVQQ1Y5VEN6eERXME1BQlppVS1XazRJd1o3dWFzUGEtNWxLbnZuaWlaTXp6YVJkb0F6b19xOXJ3c3pYVzB6MFlDZ2hBTnBNX0ZmdmpiUW5IZU9OU0YxdXRpc2M</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情波浪席卷加利福尼亚州。一些官员敦促居民戴上口罩--《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A COVID wave is washing over California, with the state seeing continued increases in the number of newly confirmed cases and hospitalizations as some officials urged the public to take greater precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the recent increases has prompted some county-level health officials to recommend that residents once again consider wearing masks in indoor public settings, at least until transmission has declined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California currently has “high” coronavirus levels in sewage, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And increases are being seen across the Golden State, from Los Angeles County to the San Francisco Bay Area to areas around the state capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that coronavirus infections are either “growing” or “likely growing” in 30 states, including California. Twenty-one states have either “very high” or “high” viral levels in wastewater. Of all regions of the U.S., the West has the highest levels of coronavirus in wastewater, followed by the South. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“California is experiencing a summer COVID wave,” said Dr. Aimee Sisson, the health officer in Yolo County, just west of Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus lab tests are coming back positive also continues to climb. For the week that ended Aug. 23, 12.07% of tests across the state came back positive, up from a rate of 6.03% for the week that ended July 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar leaps in rates were seen in L.A. County, where the positive test rate was 13.44%, up from 8.11% four weeks earlier; in Orange County, it was 18.1%, up from 9.4%; and in San Francisco, it was 8.7%, up from 7.1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she received many calls related to outpatient cases of COVID-19 while on call over the Labor Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are definitely seeing an upswing in patients with COVID,” Hudson said. “Thankfully, inpatient cases are few and far between. Wastewater levels, however, are still rising in Los Angeles, so we have not reached the top of this current wave.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will have to see what direction things go over the next one to two weeks to have a better idea” of where we end up, Hudson said. Students returning to school as well as from travel and socialization over the holiday weekend, could fuel further spread of the virus, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, the overall level of COVID hospital admissions remains “low,” but is increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Aug. 23, there were 3.62 hospital admissions for COVID for every 100,000 residents; up from a comparable rate of 1.9 four weeks earlier. The most recent rate is also higher than during the peak seen during the winter, which maxed out at 2.61 admissions for every 100,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara counties. In L.A. County, 2.8% of emergency room visits were for illnesses such as fever plus a cough or sore throat, up from 2.2% four weeks earlier. In Orange County, 2.6% of ER visits were for COVID-like illness, up from 1.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current percent of COVID-19 positivity is higher than at any point last winter,” according to Dr. Christopher Zimmerman of the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 23, 1.9% of total hospitalizations in Orange County were due to COVID — higher than at any point seen during the winter, but less than half of last summer’s peak of 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s unclear “how high or how severe this summer’s COVID wave may be,” Zimmerman and Chinsio-Kwong said, noting that this year’s rise began later than it did in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, COVID-19 hospitalizations are currently about as high as last winter’s peak, but remain lower than the peaks of the last two summers, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisson said that coronavirus levels are high in the wastewater of both Sacramento and West Sacramento, one of the most populous cities in Yolo County. Sisson &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.yolocounty.gov/Home/Components/News/News/14027/4918" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that everyone age 2 and up in West Sacramento “wear a mask when they are around others in indoor public spaces,” since coronavirus levels in sewage there are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other areas of Yolo County, including UC Davis and Woodland, where viral levels in wastewater are considered “medium,” Sisson said she recommends that people wear masks around others indoors “if they are 65 or older, have a weakened immune system, have an underlying medical condition that puts them at a greater risk of severe COVID-19, or spend time around people who fall into these categories.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wearing a high-quality mask such as an N95, KN95, or KF94 that fits well continues to provide strong protection,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus cases are increasing in Sacramento County, and coronavirus wastewater levels are considered high, according to Casey Camacho, a spokesperson for the Sacramento County Department of Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Department of Public Health also is encouraging people “to consider wearing a well-fitted mask in crowded indoor spaces, including when traveling, and to stay at home if they feel sick.” Coronavirus levels in San Francisco wastewater, and COVID hospitalizations, are up this summer “but remain below last summer’s peaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Santa Clara County, Northern California’s most populous county, COVID-related hospitalizations are up, and coronavirus levels are “high” in the sewershed of San José and Palo Alto. Current viral levels in wastewater are now similar to the levels seen in the summer of 2023, but haven’t reached last summer’s peak. COVID hospitalization rates also remain lower than recent summer seasons, public health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025-26 version of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be available within a few days at some of the nation’s pharmacy retailers, such as Walgreens and CVS. But some people are expressing frustration at new rules issued by the Trump administration that in effect require younger, healthy people under age 65 who don’t say they have an underlying health condition to consult with a healthcare provider to get a COVID vaccination in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement came under criticism by Dr. Jerome Adams, a former surgeon general who served under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/JeromeAdamsMD/status/1962906970089787442" target="_blank"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on social media, Adams said requiring people to consult with a healthcare provider before getting a COVID vaccine puts up “real access barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have insurance and can get in to see a doctor (which is no small feat in the U.S.), many doctors are going to be reticent to prescribe a medication ‘off label,’ given the (in many cases unfounded) recent rhetoric from HHS leaders,” Adams wrote, referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by the vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has a history of disparaging vaccines, has said he wants more studies on the COVID-19 shots. Other health experts have said seeking additional testing for COVID vaccines is unnecessary, given the extensive testing done before they were first distributed, and their track record since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line? It is both statistically (according to HHS’s own data) and pragmatically untrue that ‘100% of those who choose a Covid vaccine can get one.’ Continuing to repeat this reflects a lack of knowledge, empathy, or honesty,” Adams wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxPWkdZQWpiRkNjV0dyWmRJYjhLRTFfY20zMkFWRERvaThiX1hmdEtuMkQtVGRuTk9waDgwVDF0MU9xWFZFODFTY254Ml9kM0szZFlxdFFBTUJqMjJpam9RSkFFbHhnWWVfcmdqdm1CTFhFVDlaTlV3OTZ2Ri15bGFqeUthV0t5b3FrbEJ3YjFwVUJURXRpcGlHSnYtdW1FSnFmZ0pqMG96LV9HSDJ0M09MM1FrTVJDY2hIRVNjdkFLaEU4ck9rWFlmM1JnYV9hNkpGZUE</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法，每个人在70岁后都应该做的6项基本运动，以增强力量和行动能力-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/here-are-the-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-after-turning-70-according-to-a-physical-therapist</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f"&gt;If you’re looking for exercises to improve your strength, balance, mobility, and function as you get older, you’ve come to the right place. As we age, strengthening the muscles in our body is more important than ever — strength training is one of the most effective ways to prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass. It can also help build stronger bones and improve your balance and stability, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner or are returning to exercise following a long break, the good news is that things don’t have to be overly complicated. In fact, just using your bodyweight and performing a few simple exercises a few times a week can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr Nancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist who specializes in exercises for older adults, and in a video posted to her social media accounts, she shares the six exercises she prescribes to patients between 70 and 90 years old.

Here’s how to do them with good form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-lateral-step-over" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-lateral-step-over"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Lateral step over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="443f71f4-d1bc-44e4-9d5f-d9d5a3bc0ccf"&gt;For this exercise, use a can of food from the cupboard and place it on the floor. Step to one side of the can, and stand tall, engaging your core with your hands on your hips. Lift one leg and step over the can laterally, then follow with your other foot. Then, repeat the move, stepping back to the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-box-squats" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-box-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Box squats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="83cd6595-3a1b-4b5f-a9d9-02508c9de23a"&gt;For this exercise, place a box on top of a chair. Ensure the chair is sturdy and doesn’t have wheels. Squat down, bending at your knees and keeping your core engaged until your glutes touch the box, then push down through your feet to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes at the top. As you get stronger, make the box lower to the chair, then remove it entirely. To make the exercise easier, extend your arms away from the body. To make it harder, place your hands on your hips. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-standing-hip-extension" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-standing-hip-extension"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Standing hip extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c413bab-30f5-4b5a-ab7e-1294638f3ea9"&gt;For this exercise, stand facing a wall and place both hands on the wall for support. Shift your bodyweight into one leg, and straighten the other leg, keeping your foot flexed, before taking the leg back and lifting it a few inches off the floor. Keep kicking back for 10 reps, then switch onto the other leg. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-single-leg-slides" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-slides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Single leg slides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="988f05a3-3742-41c1-965c-853097326459"&gt;For this exercise, you’ll need to grab a tea towel. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core. Place one foot on a tea towel, and keeping a slight bend in both knees, slide the leg out to the side, then bring it back in, then slide it back behind you, moving slowly and with control. Keep the rest of your body still — it should only be the one leg that is moving. Complete 10 reps, then switch to work on the other leg. Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-standing-hip-flexion" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-hip-flexion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing hip flexion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c39987cf-4116-4193-94b0-a2a32356fac6"&gt;Standing facing a wall, place both hands on the wall for support. From here, engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, keeping a 90-degree bend in your knee to march your leg up towards your torso. Place the leg back on the floor, and repeat on the other side. Keep alternating sides. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-6-lateral-toe-taps" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-lateral-toe-taps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lateral toe taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f83bd91-41e0-4166-8164-df7a56faf5d2"&gt;For this exercise, start with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Place your hands on your hips. From here, lift one leg off the floor, point your toe, and tap the leg out to the side of your body. Return to your starting position, and repeat on the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9e3ca6d5-f2f2-4f35-9bfd-900f60099211"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e47481eb-b462-4ccb-b677-9d3f09f76f41"&gt;To make this workout easier, drop the number of sets — start by completing one, and work your way up. To make it harder, increase the difficulty of the exercises by increasing your range of motion — remove the box on the chair during the squats, or the size of the step in the lateral step overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exercise will work the muscles in your lower body as well as your core, and test your balance and stability. A lot of the exercises will work one side of the body at a time, and you might notice the exercises are easier on one side. This is normal, and working on your weaker side can help correct any imbalances in the body, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

You’re feeling sick, we get sick, too. Just maneuver through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His father taught him that a husband provides, a wife takes care of children. Emotional equity wasn’t built in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenforbetter/?hl=en" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; had survived infidelity and rebuilt their lives as marriage coaches. They lived through the death of their teenage son in a car accident and became grief leaders. But when Schaer watched his wife Denette suffer from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/12/what-is-perimenopause-first-signs-typical-age-and-what-to-know/70311139007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that grew to sharp mood swings, forgetfulness and extreme fatigue – he couldn't bear losing the woman he’d known for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I needed to find compassion and empathy,” Schaer, 49, says. “Nothing in life I would have my wife walk through by herself. I had to figure how to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together." data-c-credit="Octavio Jones, For USA TODAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He set the thermostat in their Tampa home to 69 degrees&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; built what he calls a wind tunnel of fans above his wife’s side of the bed and bought a white noise machine to block out the irritating way his breathing sounded. He did laundry and other chores; many he admits that he should have been doing all along. He learned about hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But most important,” he says, “I listened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just as Gen X and millennial women are changing the way they approach perimenopause and menopause, piercing through the cultural zeitgeist, so are their husbands and partners. &lt;a href="https://mindpumppodcast.com/2582-the-strange-signs-symptoms-of-perimenopause-with-dr-mary-claire-haver/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bro fitness podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are now talking about hormones and strength training. Men are joining their wives for medical appointments, going to &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause retreats&lt;/a&gt;, and making TikTok videos and &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. They are doing so with both a sense of urgency and sometimes humor. One man even named his wife’s menopause symptoms “Agnes” to remind them that it is part of his wife, but not all of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the process by which men are approaching menopause in this generation is akin to other ways they are defining masculinity. Or, at the very least, exploring how they have understood what it means to be a man. Maybe masculinity still does mean taking care of and protecting your partner, being the breadwinner and remaining stoic all the same. But just like the men who understood changing a diaper in the 1990s didn't take away their manliness, so can participating in their spouse's emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This evolution in masculinity, where vulnerability and authenticity are valued, moves away from the restrictive path in which the men interviewed by USA TODAY were raised. It’s not just changing them, but their marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Women are welcoming men to the menoconversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause shouldn’t simply be discussions in a gynecologist’s office, says &lt;a href="https://www.tamsenfadal.com/about" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tamsen Fadal&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Menopause-Charge-Health-Reclaim/dp/0306833549" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“How to Menopause.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet it was almost always relegated to the exam room, somewhere with stirrups in sight&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's not only about the body temperature changes. There's the so-called "menobelly." The irritability or walking into a room only to forget why seconds later. Oh, and a plummeting sex drive, which almost always makes women spiral into shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This can create conflict in the relationship if you don’t bring men into it,” Fadal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=653&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1306&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.' data-c-credit="Craig Barritt, Getty Images For ADAPT Community"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are few studies on how men view menopause, but one of the most recent shows that almost three of four men now say they talk with their partner about menopause. These men also discuss treatment options, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2019/10000/the_mate_survey__men_s_perceptions_and_attitudes.6.aspx" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menopause, the Journal of the Menopause Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause, the time leading up to the menopause where a woman's period stops, can last up to 10 years and include a fluctuation in hormones. It can present with symptoms ranging from frozen shoulder to achy joints and often women suffer for years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These are men who grew up with fathers who ignored menopause. These are men who now are realizing their mothers went through this and they didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After all, there's a silence that had always accompanied women going through menopause. If they dared asked for help, it was about masking symptoms − and feelings − in order to please others. It was to not draw any more attention to the fact that they were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These also are men who see that while divorce rates overall are dropping,&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/14/divorce-women-perimenopause-menopause/85622804007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; divorces among adults 50&lt;/a&gt; and older are increasing. Seven in 10 women blame perimenopause or menopause for the breakdown of their marriage, according to a survey in the United Kingdom by the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/family-law-menopause-project-newson-health-research-partner-shahzady/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Fadal helped make &lt;a href="https://themfactorfilm.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“The M Factor,”&lt;/a&gt; a documentary about menopause. When it was screened earlier this year, the majority of audiences were women. Then she noticed a shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Women were starting to bring their husbands or partners to help them understand this,” she says. “Half of the population will go through menopause, and we need the other half to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Finding his vulnerability in talking about menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theparentexpress" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Jesse Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was driving home from his sales job when he heard menopause expert &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/17/mary-claire-haver-menopause-the-m-factor/75702888007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt; on a health podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He was astounded by how often &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;women are misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, the misunderstandings about hormone therapy, and his own ignorance. So, he posed a question on his parenting TikTok account this summer: “Do women want husbands to talk to them about menopause?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hundreds of women told him they wanted men to learn more. The husband and father of two shifted his videos to menopause and perimenopause.

But, he says, he didn’t put that same energy into understanding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until now. He started therapy. He’s reading books and watching videos to learn more about perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Now if I want to talk to my wife about how I’m feeling, I write in my journal.

It's about decreasing risks for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559623/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;building strength&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of an assisted living facility. It's about the quality of the last third of a woman's life. As Maher learned more, his business shifted to helping women better understand and get treatment – from hormone therapy to nutrition – in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Men need to understand it’s not just mood swings,” says Maher, 41. “It’s the collapse of estrogen and progesterone and testosterone. Women need this to be healthy – for their hearts, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11387275/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their brains&lt;/a&gt;.

While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising&lt;/a&gt; so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51412836.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ultra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the term ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing diets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;humans have been processing food&lt;/a&gt; by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ULTRA-PROCESSED INTAKE.

Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4fpdeen&lt;/a&gt;), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;matched for levels of protein&lt;/a&gt;, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond processing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Employees in protective clothing and hard hats check hundreds of breaded chicken nugget pieces on a factory production line conveyor belt." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Breaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00549-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_50690036.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;food texture&lt;/a&gt;, can affect eating speed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Malla explains that while antipsychotic medications are effective, they only go some way to addressing symptoms of disease. "Antipsychotic medication really only works for positive symptoms, which are things that should not be there, like illusions or hallucinations," says Malla. Negative symptoms are the absence of things that should be there, such as emotional expression, ability to generate thoughts and ability to relate socially to people. The reverse of which would be social withdrawal, a lack of experience, feelings and so on. "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/epa-guidance-on-assessment-of-negative-symptoms-in-schizophrenia/86280E47EC2DA56EC5F9D8B951DF698E" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Medications have very little, if any, impact on these&lt;/a&gt;," says Malla. Generally, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/psychological-and-psychosocial-interventions-for-negative-symptoms-in-psychosis-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/73B8450EAB1E3046B4ABE0C3C4C5A1D2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;negative symptoms, like low mood, respond poorly to drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Americans overestimate how often people with mental illnesses are perpetrators of violent crimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla suggests that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32981550/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;social differences between India and Canada&lt;/a&gt; go some way to explain the difference in the success of treatments. Homelessness is less common among people with schizophrenia in Chennai, for example. Malla puts this down to families wanting to keep mental illness within the household so that any stigma associated with having a family member with schizophrenia can be "kept under wraps". He says that marriage is a key concern for families, and anything that might affect an offspring's marriageability will be dealt with as a family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla points out that families in Canada are as interested in taking care of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, as they are in India. But he says that the sophisticated legalisation of contact and confidentiality with patients can be a problem. A young adult in North America can more easily leave home and cut off contact if they wish, he says. But this could lead to worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/inm.13198" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Family interventions have been shown to be effective&lt;/a&gt; in improving recovery from psychosis. "In Chennai, a patient hardly ever comes to the clinic without a family member. We hypothesised that it would result in a better outcome on negative symptoms," says Malla. "And that's exactly what we found." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:07:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRDlSR3BvOWpEZVpJZkZMLVlpV3ppdl80cmRKMDRoMl8wRmdVVVBQeDlqRlBtM19VUW5TdVdHSHh5MTItd1FkbGluT3pPVzItNEhqVlM4ek03T0Fwa1ZoTlJ1OFlHd21FNGVXX1hqR0luNmxrbjVvTE1yMnBvaEVwdE1aMDVNUFNjcVZKTllHcEROR1JNZWRpODVwbE5LQTRZ</guid></item><item><title>减肥后皮肤松弛：专家希望你知道的事情-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/well/loose-skin-after-weight-loss.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xRnJodDZGOEdxTk1aOGpjUWlRTGF4cHJFUm14N1hSVVN2b3FFX0UzdmVXN0xnQlUteEJFYWtPbmRjcHdrT0l6TVM4bmlQNFpOV3pBbl9INWtYbGc0ak9Rd2g1Nm4wSU5QSm5SRm5qV0Jsdk9MM01HbWgtR3VpZw</guid></item><item><title>漫长的新冠肺炎疫情对医生和护士的严重打击- Medscape</title><link>https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/long-covid-hitting-doctors-and-nurses-hard-2025a1000n7q</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Siegelman, MD, contracted COVID-19 in August 2020 and, 3 months later, published a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773056" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; about his experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, he’s still dealing with the symptoms, as one of many healthcare providers who have long COVID. He said his experience highlights the impact of long COVID on hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers, by some estimates, who have been on the frontlines fighting the pandemic from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I reflect on that paper from &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, and I thought that 3 months was a long time,” said Siegelman, associate professor of emergency medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine and a practicing emergency room doctor in Atlanta. “And here I am, 5 years later, and I still have symptoms. I think that’s the case for a lot of patients with long COVID, that it just keeps getting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the precise number of US healthcare workers like Siegelman affected by long COVID is challenging. But several new studies suggest the toll of long COVID has affected healthcare workers in the US more than other Americans who have experienced or are currently living with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1582872/full" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, which surveyed 1678 US healthcare workers, found that 7.7% reported experiencing long COVID. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10167639/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/em&gt; in March 2023, involving 445 healthcare workers, reported a prevalence of 9.44%. Outside the US, a systematic review of long COVID’s impact on the National Health System out of the UK found that 18% of healthcare workers were out of work due to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Putrino, PhD, physical therapist and director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City, who has been helping those with long COVID recover, has seen a fair number of healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say 5%-7% of the people who are coming into our center right now are healthcare workers,” he said. His clinic has treated around 3500 people with long COVID and sees 500-700 new patients per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthcare workers are probably where we do start to see disproportionate effects of long COVID,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Acute to Chronic COVID Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegelman said his long COVID symptoms are far different from what he initially experienced, making it difficult for him to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, I had fever, headaches, some chills, but it wasn’t bad,” he said. “I was able to stay at home, and I had no respiratory issues at that point. Over these years, I’ve had little setbacks, sometimes big setbacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His low-grade fevers refused to abate, and he quarantined himself in his basement for 40 days to isolate himself from his family, speaking with them through FaceTime or walkie-talkies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegelman was out of work for about 6 months before returning, and only in a limited capacity, which he said made him feel as though a burden was placed on his colleagues. He could initially only work just 4 hours at a time during day shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Siegelman 2 years before he was able to return to regular, full-time work — but with some restrictions due to the chronic nature of his condition. He can’t work night shifts and still lives with fatigue, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241381-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and palpitations that require consistent therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m still on a pile of medicine, [though] it’s fewer than I used to be on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said several emergency medicine physicians he knows have been living with worse cases of long COVID. One couldn’t return to work in a clinical capacity at all, forced to relinquish a career she loved and transition into an administrative role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, Siegelman published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11293604/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Topics in Antiviral Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which detailed the stories of two physicians who became patients. One couldn’t work for 5 months and then could only work limited, part-time shifts for several years. The other physician experienced brain fog and other cognitive issues that made it difficult to carry out crucial clinical tasks like delivering patient reports and presentations to supervisors. He also said he had to “do more, read more, and work harder to retain the same information as previously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Million Americans Live With Long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300947" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recent Yale-led study&lt;/a&gt; found that 20 million Americans have been diagnosed with long COVID, suggesting potentially hundreds of thousands of US healthcare workers have been affected. Months after their initial infection, these people struggle to return to work, let alone be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/long-covid-among-workers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;January 2025 report&lt;/a&gt; from the US Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, nearly 1 in 4 healthcare workers (23.5%) with long COVID reported their symptoms significantly affected their work. Arjun Venkatesh, MD, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, and a lead author of the Yale-led study, has observed the mental and physical toll long COVID has had on his fellow colleagues suffering from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five most prevalent symptoms among people who missed more than 10 workdays were fatigue, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1048596-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;headache&lt;/a&gt;, muscle aches, joint pains, and shortness of breath. Those with these specific symptoms were also the most likely to experience work loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venkatesh has mostly observed colleagues contracting COVID at home rather than at work. For those who later develop long COVID, treatment access remains an issue. Being a healthcare professional doesn’t necessarily guarantee better access to care or treatment than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard colleagues say something to the effect of ‘I’ve tried everything I could find…despite that, nothing has worked,’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Stress Exacerbates the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putrino said the high-stress nature of many healthcare jobs makes workers in the medical industry especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a physician working in a critical care setting…you may have to work 4 or 5 hours beyond your shift,” he said. “That creates a really dangerous situation for people in the healthcare setting who live with long COVID because it means they could easily experience a crash as a result of pushing far beyond their energy envelope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare workers may not seek treatment before their illness spirals out of control, for a number of reasons, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that there is a stigma associated with healthcare workers admitting that they have an unmanaged chronic condition,” Putrino said. “So many healthcare workers that I’ve spoken to have said that due to minimizing comments from their colleagues or just a general fear of not being believed, they haven’t accessed care until their symptoms got really out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aileen Grant, PhD, a research fellow at the University of Stirling in Stirling, Scotland, has published a systematic &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299743" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the impact long COVID has on healthcare workers working within the National Health System in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant’s study found that 18% of participants were out of work due to their symptoms, but a large percentage of people continued to work despite their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our occupational health policies really aren’t fit for an episodic disability,” Grant said. “It’s almost a dichotomy between being in work or being out of work, whereas these people’s symptoms can fluctuate over time, and they can have crashes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misunderstanding Long COVID’s Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After National Health Service (NHS) workers on the frontlines combated the initial waves of the pandemic, they felt virtually ignored by the system they put their lives on the line for after being stricken themselves, Grant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were working a frontline occupation to help the NHS in its time of need, and then they were being abandoned once they took ill,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ireland, &lt;a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41570173.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;four nurses with long COVID profiled in The Irish Examiner&lt;/a&gt; said their lives have never been the same since their initial infection, with none being able to return to work. They feel their voices are being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Service Executive — Ireland’s publicly funded healthcare system — continues to fight its requests for sick leave. All four nurses belong to a group of around 160 Health Service Executive staff who rely on a special pay scheme to support them through long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for policies that support long COVID research, treatment, and patient care is also lacking, healthcare workers say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venkatesh fears the Trump administration’s pullback in funding for COVID research may further hinder efforts to understand how to treat long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [Biden] administration had an entire office centered around long COVID…with a registry funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” he said. “I don’t know what the future holds with this new administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:56:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxON0lmYWQzQ3d1U0FtcVNfYjByUndnenZMYy1SZFpOZEhkdEZHLWphWGFYTG43YXBZTVBkZUUyZTJwQ3RSS25GOFI2cjZIeEItNnY3ZkdvU1ZhV045a1hya1ppNGRYTUZjMk9IWlQxbGJWSFFnT2VGX0NjT1JPRFQ2S0taZGJtSmhGYUs3VjZ3RVUtMXg1QWtr</guid></item><item><title>儿童疫苗接种计划的重大调整可能即将到来- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/03/childhood-vaccine-schedule-at-risk-rfk-cdc-turmoil/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts are bracing for what could be fundamental changes to childhood vaccine policies that don’t align with scientific consensus, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undergoes a major leadership shakeup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ousted CDC director Susan Monarez after she &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;refused his demand&lt;/a&gt; to approve all recommendations made by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee, whose members were handpicked by him. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has since &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/"&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; one of his allies, former biotech investor Jim O’Neill, as acting director.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other senior CDC leaders &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;also resigned&lt;/a&gt;, including the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the instability, experts fear that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is slated to meet on Sept. 18 and 19, could propose severe changes that limit commonly used vaccines. The committee &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-16706.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plans to discuss&lt;/a&gt; not only Covid-19 vaccines, but also other shots to protect against infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus, as well as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;ACIP’s last meeting&lt;/a&gt;, the first gathering of the new members chosen by Kennedy, some expressed skepticism towards vaccines, but the group did not make any recommendations that created major disruptions to the current schedule for children. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Now though, with Monarez gone, experts are concerned that members could “be very much emboldened to make more aggressive changes,” said Jose Romero, a former chair of the committee who has consulted for pharma companies on vaccine policy since leaving the committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear how long O’Neill will be acting director and how he will handle ACIP recommendations. He has described himself as “very strongly pro-vaccine,” but he’s also closely aligned with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that ACIP historically rubber-stamped vaccine decisions — although the committee did debate evidence and withhold recommendations in some cases — and that vaccine makers should face greater scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The panel’s recommendations have real-world consequences. Federal and private payers are required to make vaccines free for people if they are recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. The committee also recommends which vaccines it thinks should be part of the Vaccines For Children Program, which covers the costs of vaccines and therapies for children without health insurance or on Medicaid. A little over half the nation’s children receive vaccines through the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, experts fear that the panel may restrict or roll back a recommendation that it made last meeting in support of a preventive monoclonal antibody to protect babies against RSV. Separately, they believe, members are likely to question hepatitis B shots that are given to infants at birth and that have been credited with preventing children from developing debilitating, lifelong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of surprise likely to loom in terms of where this committee will go in this coming meeting and going forward,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. “It will be to continue to emphasize the alleged potential harms of vaccines, to understate their value and their effectiveness, and to continue to chip away at the infrastructure for our vaccine recommendations that we’ve had for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-covid-19"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration last week revoked emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/27/fda-covid-vaccines-kennedy-rescinds-emergency-use-authorization/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; narrower approvals that could make them more difficult to access, particularly for young children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Pfizer’s vaccine, developed with BioNTech, had been available to children over 6 months old under an emergency use authorization, but the latest move now restricts the shot to children older than 5. Moderna’s vaccine is available for children as young as 6 months, but only for those with an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness from a Covid infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that anyone can still get Covid vaccines if they want it but that the risks of these vaccines often outweigh any demonstrable benefit five years after the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Experts expect that ACIP will support the FDA authorizations, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The pediatric group  &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;issued its own recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 shots should be available for all children between 6 months and 23 months, as well as children over 2 at risk for severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rsv"&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting, members &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-merck-rsv-monoclonal-antibody-enflonsia/"&gt;voted to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a new monoclonal antibody to protect infants from RSV, Merck’s Enflonsia. A similar product, Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus, has been in use since the fall of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But during the meeting, member Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, raised concern that there appeared to be more deaths in arms of clinical trials where children got the antibodies than in placebo arms. CDC and FDA staff noted that all deaths in trials are rigorously studied and researchers concluded that the deaths in these trials were not linked to the antibody. Levi nonetheless voted against recommending Enflonsia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the meeting has concluded, another ACIP member, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/what-the-acip-wasnt-shown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt; a piece by Yaffa Shir-Raz, a researcher at the University of Haifa. She argued that the presentation of data on the antibody was flawed and obscured safety risks. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University, wrote a &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2025/08/23/a-baseless-attack-on-groundbreaking-rsv-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; countering the post and explaining why the CDC’s analysis was epidemiologically sound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone, though, said his trust in the CDC’s data presentation “appears to have been ill-advised.” He wrote that committee members had little chance to review the data ahead of the meeting, and “going forward, speaking for myself, based on these findings, I will no longer be able to trust that what is presented in CDC summaries to the ACIP is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone wrote on his blog that he couldn’t discuss future ACIP plans, but experts suspect that the committee may now unwind the RSV recommendation. They fear the group may pull its backing not only for Merck’s antibody, but also for the one made by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Shir-Raz in her post suggested that “the seizure risk is likely a class effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If ACIP does do that, “that’s a tremendous loss for children, and places their health care and their lives in jeopardy,” Romero said. Babies’ lungs are still developing and they’re most vulnerable to RSV. Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s antibody, as well as a new maternal vaccine, have been key tools to protect young children. A CDC report &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/08/cdc-report-suggests-rsv-vaccine-abrysvvo-antibody-shot-beyfortus-reduced-infant-hospitalizations/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that last winter, the first time these new measures were available, there was a substantial drop in RSV hospitalizations among babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy may support withdrawing recommendations for antibodies. When ACIP voted for Merck’s antibody in the last meeting, a CDC director had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, so it was up to Kennedy to decide whether or not to adopt the recommendation; he did not take any action. It was only after Monarez was confirmed as CDC director that she adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, said these developments are a concerning sign for how the new ACIP will overturn traditional processes as they make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members shouldn’t have voted on the antibody in the last meeting if they felt like they needed more time to review data, because questions and disagreements should be discussed in the official public meetings with health officials and not online after the fact, he said. “It’s not fair to the American public to have that as the deliberative process to make such important decisions for our children.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hepatitis-b"&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the committee will also question the first hepatitis B shot given to infants at birth before they leave the hospital, which anti-vaccine advocates have long targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff raised concerns in his opening remarks in the earlier meeting: “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital?” he asked. “That’s the question. Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts said that even though mothers are routinely tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy, it’s not a foolproof method. The mother’s status could change after she takes the test, and there could be documentation errors. If infants do acquire hepatitis B from their mothers, the consequences can be devastating — they are at higher risk of lifelong liver infection that may lead to liver cancer or the need for a transplant before they reach 20-years-old. There’s no cure for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The birth dose “is a way of having a complete safety net for those babies,” and there’s no safety reason to remove it, Campbell said. With the current vaccination schedule, the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;getting close&lt;/a&gt; to entirely eliminating hepatitis B cases at birth, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mmrv"&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the previous ACIP meeting, Kulldorff raised a concern around MMRV vaccination — that for the first dose given to children between 12 to 47 months old, the combination MMRV shot poses a higher risk of seizure compared with giving two separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines. (The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-factsheet-hcp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the seizure risk for the combination shot is about 8 out of every 100,000 children, while the risk for the separate shots is about 4 out of every 100,000.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff then proposed that the MMRV combination should not be administered as the first dose for children under 47 months, since doctors can use the separate shots instead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC already indicates that it prefers the first dose be given as two separate shots, and pediatricians already widely follow that guidance. If the ACIP committee votes to formally withdraw its recommendation for the MMRV combination shot for the first dose, the effects on real-world practice would be minimal, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They noted, though, that they’re concerned with how the seizure risk will be portrayed. “These are nuanced, complex issues, right? But if the takeaway and the headlines are — MMRV causes seizures — then I worry about the way in which the message is being conveyed,” said Scott, the infectious disease specialist at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also fears it’s only a matter of time before ACIP restricts the use of the MMRV combination shot not only for the first dose, but also for subsequent doses for which there is not an increased risk of seizures. Anything that limits vaccinations or adds complexity to vaccination schedules, he said, would be a problem, particularly as the country grapples with increasing numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e"&gt;Some of the strongest, fittest people I know are in their 60s (or over), and show no signs of slowing down. Despite being in my 30s, I feel offended when people write off those who are older simply because of age; your strength and overall fitness don’t drop off a cliff just because you’ve hit a new age milestone, and for that reason, your exercise routine shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I encourage people to listen to their bodies and adapt their workout routines accordingly. However, I certainly don’t encourage anyone to stop lifting weights unless they have to, and Eddie Baruta, head of the gym floor at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ultimateperformance.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://ultimateperformance.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ultimate Performance&lt;/a&gt;, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e-2"&gt;“Thankfully, the utter BS that people in their 60s are ‘too old’ to start weight training is being dismantled,” he says. “So, too, is the misconception that in your 60s, the best way to stay fit and strong and maintain a healthy weight is to pound the treadmill seven days a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your gym experience, Baruta’s five exercises to build strength, muscle and power in your 60s (and beyond) are must-tries.

"You need to choose exercises that hit that sweet spot between improving your strength and minimizing your risk of injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Baruta says to train for function, longevity and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifting too heavy too soon greatly increases the risk of injury, particularly as joints, tendons and connective tissue naturally become less forgiving with age,” he adds. “Instead, older adults should prioritize perfect form, controlled tempo and a full range of motion, which ensures that the right muscles are working properly. It’s not about lifting the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; weight but about lifting &lt;em&gt;well.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="fd2b7c41-3c08-45e0-a471-798a75ae1ff1"&gt;“Performing chest-supported rows helps maintain a stable torso and keeps the focus on the target muscles,” Baruta says. "This is particularly beneficial for older trainees who may have weaker spinal stabilizers or a history of lower-back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The support allows safer execution of a pulling movement, strengthening postural muscles that are essential for daily tasks like reaching, pulling and lifting, protecting the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Upper back (rhomboids, mid and lower traps), lats, rear deltoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="98c0d887-8db9-4705-8854-b88ffb88f226"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your dumbbells and place them on the floor at the head of the bench.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie face down on the bench, making sure that your chin clears the top edge. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your legs and drive your feet into the floor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick up the dumbbells one at a time and let your arms hang fully extended by your sides, with your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press your hips into the bench, lift your chest slightly and look at the floor just in front of you.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pinch the shoulder blades together. Keep the elbows pointed out at a 45-degree angle.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your elbows cannot travel any further back without the shoulders rotating inwards and the upper back rounding, pause for a moment and contract the upper back.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reverse the motion, under control, to the start position.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-good-morning" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-good-morning"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

It’s a movement that mimics hip-hinging tasks like picking up objects off the ground,” Baruta says. “When executed properly, it builds the hamstrings, glutes and spinal erectors, which are vital muscles for improving your posture, balance and mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Hamstrings, glutes, lower back (spinal erectors), core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="923db8e6-0ae1-4927-8064-aa942b01e17e"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Position a barbell across your upper back, just below the base of your neck. Avoid resting it directly on your cervical spine (the neck).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a firm, even grip on the bar, keeping your elbows pointed down to create a stable “shelf” with your upper back muscles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward (or slightly out, depending on comfort and hip mobility).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage your core, take a deep breath into your belly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a slight bend in your knees, push your hips back as if you were closing a door behind you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean your torso forward, maintaining a flat back, until your torso is roughly parallel to the floor (or as far as your hamstring flexibility allows).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive your hips forward and squeeze your glutes to bring your torso upright. Keep the bar stable across your back throughout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c9a9b18a-4e7d-4f9e-b42b-54534ecc9fb4"&gt;“Don’t relax at the bottom; maintain bracing and tension in your core and lats the entire time," Baruta says. "Only lower as far as your mobility allows while keeping good form. With practice, your range will improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-farmer-s-walk" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-farmer-s-walk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="29f73b77-fb05-46cd-84a2-ceca00ef3d68"&gt;“The prowler push is a dynamic full-body movement that builds strength, power and cardiovascular capacity through resisted sprinting,” Baruta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those over 60, this makes it an excellent tool for maintaining explosive lower-body strength and metabolic capacity while minimizing the risk of injury. The exercise’s emphasis on sprint-like mechanics also fosters agility and mobility, which are critical components of functionality as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Quadriceps and calves during sprint-style pushes. When heavy, more the glutes and posterior chain due to increased hip flexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="d4d10215-5e65-4343-9d3e-1bf54703d0e2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grab the handles, arms bent or straight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flex at the hip to allow enough room to push. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the spine neutral. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push and sprint as fast as you can. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

She offers straightforward guidance for anyone concerned about or diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Dr. Zaghiyan stresses the life-saving importance of early screening, particularly colonoscopies, and urges patients to seek second opinions to ensure accurate diagnoses. She warns against unverified remedies and emphasizes taking prompt, informed action when symptoms arise. Her advice highlights how timely medical decisions can dramatically improve outcomes, highlighting the critical role of awareness, professional consultation, and early intervention in combating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 hard truths about colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Get a colonoscopy early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zaghiyan stresses that everyone should begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45, even if they feel healthy or have no family history. Colonoscopies allow doctors to visually inspect the entire colon and remove precancerous polyps before they develop into cancer. Unlike at-home stool tests, which can miss a significant number of polyps, colonoscopies are more than 95% effective at detecting and preventing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proper preparation, including dietary adjustments and the use of laxatives, is essential for an accurate examination. Patients should also plan for post-procedure transport due to sedation. Starting screenings early can dramatically increase the chances of detecting cancer at a curable stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Take screening and diagnosis seriously&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection is critical in improving survival rates for colorectal cancer patients. Dr. Zaghiyan notes that patients diagnosed at stage one have around a 90% chance of surviving at least five years, while those diagnosed at stage four have only a 10% five-year survival rate. Symptoms like rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss should never be ignored. Delaying medical attention or dismissing these signs as minor issues can allow the disease to progress, making treatment far more complicated and reducing the likelihood of a positive outcome. Taking diagnosis and screening seriously can be the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Seek second opinions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zaghiyan strongly recommends getting a second opinion for any diagnosis or if symptoms are concerning. Misdiagnoses are not uncommon, and consulting multiple experts ensures that patients receive the most accurate assessment and treatment plan. For instance, rectal bleeding might be incorrectly attributed to hemorrhoids without proper examination. Patients should feel empowered to ask questions, challenge their care plans, and consult additional specialists if necessary. Taking the extra step to verify your diagnosis can prevent mistakes and provide access to the latest treatment options, potentially saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Avoid unverified remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online advice and alternative treatments can be misleading or harmful. Dr. Zaghiyan warns against trusting unproven cures, such as extreme diets, supplements, or home remedies promoted online. Instead, patients should rely on evidence-based medical treatments and consult registered cancer dietitians to safely complement conventional therapy. For those seeking innovative approaches, enrolling in clinical trials with rigorous oversight is far safer than following anecdotal or unverified claims. Sticking to verified medical advice increases the likelihood of successful treatment and minimizes unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Act timely and follow medical guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying treatment is one of the most dangerous decisions a patient can make. Dr. Zaghiyan emphasizes that once concerning symptoms appear or a diagnosis is confirmed, timely action can mean the difference between curable and advanced disease. Following your doctor’s recommendations without unnecessary delay, adhering to medication schedules, and attending follow-up appointments is crucial. Patients should avoid waiting to “see if it goes away” and instead act promptly, as early intervention substantially increases survival chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms and &lt;keyword id="28671010" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="risks-of-colon-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;risks of colon cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer often develops silently, showing few or no symptoms in its early stages. Being aware of both warning signs and risk factors is crucial, as early detection can dramatically improve survival rates. Individuals should pay attention to changes in their digestive health and seek prompt medical evaluation if they notice unusual patterns or persistent discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Common symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in stool or rectal bleeding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing stools)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue and unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent or urgent bowel movements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Risk factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age over 45&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family history of colorectal cancer or polyps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity, smoking, or high consumption of processed foods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sedentary lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
