Researchers at the University of Toronto think the pace of everyday speech may be a better indicator of cognitive decline than difficulty finding a word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicate that changes in general talking speed may reflect changes in the brain," &lt;a href="https://baycrestfoundation.org/articles/research/talking-faster-is-linked-to-better-brain-health/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; cognitive neuroscientist Jed Meltzer when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that talking speed should be tested as part of standard cognitive assessments to help clinicians detect cognitive decline faster and help older adults support their brain health as they age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;5 Early, Speech-Related Signs You're at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lethologica, also known as the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue"&gt;tip of the tongue&lt;/a&gt;' phenomenon, is experienced by young and old alike. But as we grow older, finding the name for things can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jiag.jiag_32_21"&gt;become more challenging,&lt;/a&gt; especially over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore why that is, researchers asked 125 healthy adults, between the ages of 18 and 90, to describe a scene in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants were shown pictures of everyday objects while listening to audio that was designed to confirm or confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if participants were shown a picture of a broom, the audio might say 'groom', which helps them recall the word through rhyme. But on the flip side, the audio might also offer a related word like 'mop', which can lead the brain astray, momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faster a person's natural speech in the first task, the more quickly they came up with answers in the second task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with the 'processing speed theory', which argues that a general slowdown in cognitive processing lies at the very center of cognitive decline, not a slowdown in memory centers specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that older adults are significantly slower than younger adults in completing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;various cognitive tasks&lt;/a&gt;, including word-production tasks such as picture naming, answering questions, or reading written words," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2024.2315774"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; a team led by University of Toronto psychologist Hsi T. Wei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In natural speech, older adults also tend to produce more dysfluencies such as unfilled and filled pauses (e.g., "uh" and "um") in between speech and have a generally slower speech rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/slowed-speech-may-indicate-cognitive-decline-more-accurately-than-forgetting-words-224812"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;, dementia researcher Claire Lancaster said that the study from Toronto "has opened exciting doors… showing that it's not just what we say but how fast we say it that can reveal cognitive changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-of-future-alzheimers-could-be-hidden-in-the-way-you-speak"&gt;Recently, some AI algorithms&lt;/a&gt; have used speech patterns to predict an Alzheimer's diagnosis with an accuracy of 78.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that patients with more signs of amyloid plaque in their brain are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14283/jpad.2021.8"&gt;1.2 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to show speech-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-linked-to-a-common-virus-you-already-have"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, as are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers at Stanford University &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13731"&gt;led a study&lt;/a&gt; that found longer pauses and slower speech rates were associated with higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;tangled tau proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging records of 237 cognitively unimpaired adults suggest those with greater tau burdens tended to have a slower speech rate, longer pauses between speech, and more pauses overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants with greater evidence of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;tau in their brains&lt;/a&gt; did not have more difficulty producing the right answer in memory recall tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps participants dealing with early memory issues are still finding the right answer; they are just taking longer to get there, leading to slower speech with more pauses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's true, then &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-part-of-the-brain-responsible-for-making-sure-words-sound-right"&gt;speech patterns&lt;/a&gt;

to figure out what &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;our words&lt;/a&gt; are saying about our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2024.2315774"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2025. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga36es00003b6q0q3zz96x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00063b6qoxtsjogv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00073b6qy4l2my4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00083b6qgd1j2wq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1,700 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" target="_blank"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00093b6qr7dihq3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/#:~:text=Measles%20has%20been%20officially%20%E2%80%9Celiminated,in%20any%20year%20since%201992." target="_blank"&gt;elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000a3b6qlaa7utcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000b3b6qwtafrmxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiga3vog000d3b6q2gr86dbd@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="schools-and-small-brush-fires" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Schools and ‘small brush fires’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3jso00043b6qckj4phgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000i3b6qbawnqgp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000j3b6qlzs1dz9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000k3b6q61dm2560@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000l3b6qpzhz0kxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000m3b6qhxyk6e7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000n3b6qsruyqipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000o3b6qqzud3coy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to &lt;a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/features/your_health/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccine-requirements-worry-public-health-experts-in-south-carolina/article_86dc5de0-926f-11e7-93ba-47e9fd2cff5f.html" target="_blank"&gt;data published by The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000p3b6qun5f5de4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000q3b6q9193chwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000x3b6q5pbnc7a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-autism-baseless-new-guidance-website/" target="_blank"&gt;have been ignored by health authorities&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000y3b6qq7ywua7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000z3b6q527u4zv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout 2025, he has made other &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;misleading or unsupported statements&lt;/a&gt;. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100103b6q0pvgj7y9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100113b6qe8w7teoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100123b6q64jecj7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100133b6qttzl3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100143b6qdiyzl3m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100153b6q3knudvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s covid vaccine outreach efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100163b6q0ka46bda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100173b6ql0oy4ya7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100183b6qrf88mi38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/families/schoolhealth/dashboard.php" target="_blank"&gt;MMR vaccine rates have declined&lt;/a&gt; among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2022-02-01/missouri-senate-rejects-governors-pick-for-health-director-over-support-for-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;rejected a public health director&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100193b6qeqfo9dcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001a3b6qhndyynvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for covid vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001b3b6qjen4zuuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001c3b6qpn1lp3r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001d3b6q9j0s60a2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001e3b6quhnp6psb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

What is the meaning of all this, what is life? Why am I here, given that I haven’t signed a consent form to be alive here and now, so what’s this all about, really?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too was tortured by these deep questions as a young student in philosophy, and used to ponder them standing in front of a cast of Rodin’s statue in the grounds of the Hôtel Biron in Paris. I guess I was looking for something, the meaning of all this. Since then, and after drinking so much coffee that I could flood a city with it, I still haven’t got an answer. And yet, one day, something happened: a breakthrough, or perhaps an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I went back to &lt;em&gt;The Thinker&lt;/em&gt; as I had so many times when younger: he was still there, still thinking, holding his head as if all those deep, heavy thoughts had transformed his skull to stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for the right angle to take a selfie, a miracle happened: I got hungry. Partly because of the heat, partly because I’d had just one black coffee in the morning, the head of Rodin’s &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt; started tilting and melting, and the massive weight of his &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; became visible to my mind. It was as if the statue was slowly liquefying and transforming into a vegetal living thing, something like a salad, or perhaps a cucumber? Something fresh anyway, something that I could have eaten on the spot. And then some questions popped into my head: did the Thinker like cucumber salad? Where did he grow up? Did he prefer summer or winter? White wine or red? Where was he from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that moment I realised I had got it all wrong. I was so obsessed with his thinking brain that I had ignored his toes – not to mention the rest &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;of him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;rains are highly fashionable. A very common belief is that the human mind and cognition lie in the head, within the confines of a spongy greyish organ called ‘the brain’ encased within skull and skin. While I was looking at that &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt;’s head, with my stomach protesting, I realised I had completely dismissed his body. I was obsessed with understanding his mind, and my mind via his brain, but I completely ignored the rest of him. Like the great majority of scientists and philosophers throughout history, I too was putting cognition into the head and forgetting about the body, treating it as something that got in the way of pure cerebral thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a philosopher hadn’t been my only dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d decided to study philosophy after becoming a frustrated musician. My parents, God bless them, considered that singing opera and playing piano were cool ways to impress the visitors, but wouldn’t lead to a career. Now they regret their decision not to allow me to take a musical path. When visitors politely ask what their daughter is doing for a living and they reply: ‘She’s a philosopher,’ the visitors look puzzled as if needing an extra explanation: ‘Yes, but what exactly is she &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;?’ My parents can’t say ‘she’s &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;’ because that would make them look silly, and they are extremely proud and reasonable folks. Now, if I were a musician, well, that would have been way simpler. Everyone gets what &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;musicians do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt a modern fascination with the thinking brain as the fundamental basis of human cognition. But why? Is this the only entrance point that allows us to understand who we are and what human cognition is? Here I propose another angle. While neurons are indeed fascinating, their complex activity is only part of the story of human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, brains are part of the body, and bodies are made of cells and many other constituents, some of which are not literally &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt;, like our unique DNA is. There are many ‘Brain and Body’ research institutes around the world, but no ‘Liver and Body’ institutes. Why is that? It’s because we think the liver is (part) of the body. But why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body? There’s no evidence that the brain is made of a different kind of ‘physical stuff’ from the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a shift in focus from neural to cellular processing to highlight the fundamental role of cells in constituting biological self-organising systems such as the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he journey of understanding who we are, scientifically and philosophically, starts traditionally with a thinking guy – yes, it’s usually a guy, a solitary male genius – sorting out the mystery of the Universe from within his ivory tower. Yet, the journey of who we are as living beings starts way before, when a couple of cells start negotiating energetic resources with some other bunch of cells in the depths of a womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a philosopher/frustrated musician/cognitive neuroscientist, I now give academic talks all over the world, and one of my favourite things to do is to say the following line while carefully scanning the audience for their reactions: ‘You have all spent time growing inside another person’s body.’ Most of the time, people’s eyes widen as if some big mystery has just been revealed to them. Some nod their heads, others seem perplexed or in denial. But surely these smart academics know that babies don’t just drop from the sky or pop out from cabbages? As adults, we all know that we have been babies ourselves, and that we have all developed inside another person’s body. Why is this biological and scientific fact so difficult to recognise for our intelligentsia? Why are we so obsessed with minds, with pure self-conscious minds, while forgetting about bodies, and specifically about the other body that carried and fed our own one? Just think about it: long before being these lovely adults with hopes and dreams and failures, drinking coffee, paying taxes, and reading fancy books and articles online, each of us spent some time as a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;single cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more mind-blowing: all human beings gradually develop from cells to a human body &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; another human body. Pregnancy is a universal human fact that concerns everyone, not just a few of us. All cells of the human organism originate from a single cell, the zygote, are closely interconnected, mutually influence one another, and operate in synchrony to achieve common goals – maintenance of homeostasis and constant adaptation to changes of the surrounding environment. This means that we arrive into this world not on a solitary rock dropped by some mastermind, but as living biological creatures deeply dependent upon and connected with another living body. And then we need others to take care of us for quite some time before we can find a rock to sit on and think about deep things like the meaning of life or quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;For that Thinker to contemplate the meaning of life, he has to self-regulate his humble internal bodily states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand minds, we need to grasp first how we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; minds. We need to start with the cells that compose our humble toes before zooming into the mystery of the brain. Why? Because our cells solve the biggest and most urgent problem of this great and mysterious adventure called life without a brain, and before we had a brain: how to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are living creatures. Living creatures are self-organising biological systems whose bodies constantly perform the humble yet essential, basic task of keeping track of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-related information-processing to secure survival. In short, this means that your body works for you even when &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/two-billion-humans-are-doing-something-bizarre-right-now-sleeping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;you are asleep&lt;/a&gt; or under anaesthesia: your heart keeps beating for you, not for someone else. This also means that all bodily processes have &lt;em&gt;the self&lt;/em&gt; at their very core, simply because they obey the universal drive governing all living systems which is: &lt;em&gt;don’t die!&lt;/em&gt; Self-preservation is fundamental. But because our body is a living system governed by the basic law of self-preservation, this means that all our experiences are necessarily embodied &lt;em&gt;self-&lt;/em&gt;experiences. In perceiving and experiencing the world, we ‘smuggle in’ our own fundamental self-survival goals. This is something we share with cats and worms and viruses. Whether this is also something we share with artificial systems is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodily experiences are thus necessarily connected to biological self-regulation (or homeostasis) and self-preservation. For example, a penguin can survive in very cold temperatures, while humans can’t. Every organism has a set of optimal states it has to maintain in order to stay alive. If you are too cold, or too hot, or you need to go to the loo, or you are hungry and dream of salads, then you can’t think properly and solve complex abstract problems. For that Thinker to be able to contemplate the meaning of life on a rock, first he has to successfully self-regulate his humble internal bodily states. In short, the body is life – it is the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of human existence. If one is alive, one is experiencing through one’s body, even when asleep, even under anaesthesia. And this very simple idea is crucial for redefining how we understand cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;et’s forget for a moment the Thinker, static and isolated on his pedestal, and go back to the growing or developing thinker. How did she get there in the first place? What is this thinker made of? Is she hungry or upset? All these questions may seem silly or irrelevant for the noble question ‘What is cognition?’ but here I suggest that, actually, it’s quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the neurons work and how we get from neurons to minds, we first need to get back to square one, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381002100043X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; how we get from cells to selves.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Jean de Calan, © and courtesy &lt;a href="https://collections.musee-rodin.fr/page/dessins/66615bc8b358e62d33dee7bd?v=mosaic&amp;amp;s=domaine&amp;amp;so=desc&amp;amp;pgn=39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Musée Rodin, Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence from neurobiology and biochemistry suggests that cognitive categories such as ‘sensing’, ‘memory’ and ‘learning’ can be applied non-metaphorically to the behaviour of simple organisms such as bacteria. Previous work on ‘basal cognition’ questioned the prevailing idea that only brains (ie, collectives of neuronal cells) have the ability to ‘cognise’ or ‘learn’. Rather, non-neural cells and simple organisms may also be &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived&lt;/a&gt; as active, primitive ‘cognisers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of cells must cooperate toward the production of one ‘embryo’ – achieving specific goals in their navigation of anatomical morphospace. But if the blastocyst is cut into pieces, each fragment self-organises its own embryo, resulting in monozygotic twins, triplets and so forth (which may or may not be conjoined). Thus, each cell is some other cell’s ‘external’ neighbour, and the collective must dynamically decide where the embryo ends and the outside world begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;brain yet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a dynamic and complex self-organising system such as the human body needs to be able to play a double poker game, so to speak, to survive and potentially reproduce. First, it must successfully maintain sensory states within certain physiologically viable bounds. Second, it must flexibly change these states to adapt to a volatile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose you are a cell within a self-organising biological system called the human body and you are obsessed with survival, like all sensible living creatures are. You don’t have a brain yet, no neurons at your disposal, but you still need to survive somehow. What do you do? How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a brain yet? It’s a major puzzle that Nature had to solve via billions of years of trials and errors. And she &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;did! How?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we need to answer the following question: which is the basic system at the organismic level that tells your cells which one is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; cell, and which one is not? The world is full of signals, and disturbing noise. You have to have some sort of filter that allows you to focus on what is vital for you and to dismiss or fight back against what is not good for you. That’s the job of the immune system. For adaptive biological self-organising systems such as the human body, immune cells develop before neurons, in order to take care and keep track of one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theory I propose here considers all bodily cells and their complex interconnections as being fundamental for cognition, not just neurons. Among our cells, the immune system plays a very special role, working in tandem with the neural system to help us build the ‘self’. The brain is usually considered &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/the-brain-has-a-team-of-conductors-orchestrating-consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the conductor&lt;/a&gt; of the orchestra playing the concertos of your mind. I disagree. Nature invented a maestro way more discrete, less showy and dazzling perhaps than the brain and its sparkling connections, but older and very efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he metabolic self-regulation and the immune system are fundamental components of organismic self-organisation in humans. It comprises a cellular network capable of distinguishing between self, non-self, missing self, and aberrant self, including misplaced cells and aberrant intracellular and extracellular molecules. In addition, the immune system also regulates the nervous system, behaviour, metabolism and thermogenesis, and takes part in the fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neuroimmune tandem acts as key ‘fact-checker’ for all incoming information relevant for self-survival. From the body’s perspective, there is no such thing as perceptual time off or ‘blackout’ (except when one is dead). The body needs to keep track of one’s ‘self’ information all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being fundamentally a bodily system, the brain needs to carefully orchestrate and align its neural processing with a complex network of other types of cellular processing, particularly the immune system, to ensure the organism’s survival and to allow it to continue to have viable interactions with the world. Importantly, this idea was already present in the pioneering &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1878127/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of Francisco Varela and colleagues who spent quite some time working on the immune system in relation to cognitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before neurons get off the ground, your immune system needs to be clever enough to tell which cell is ‘self’ and which one is not. If, for some reason, your immune cells get tricked and let a virus in, say, then that may be the end of our Thinker, and no contemplation of the meaning of life on a rock will be possible afterwards. Life happens way before, at the bodily, cellular level, without our explicit awareness. And life happens to us without our permission, so to speak. None of us chose to be alive. It simply happens to us. It happened to my cat, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Simon too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we begin examining and introspecting the human mind and its mysteries systematically, as a scientific and philosophical endeavour, inevitably we are adults and hence we question the world from &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; adult perspective. In doing so, however, we may blindly use an adult-biased lens, which prevents us from capturing fundamental aspects of our minds. This observation seems trivial at first sight, yet &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it is not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do not pop out like Athena from Zeus’ head, or like the Thinker from Rodin’s hands. Rather, we are gestated, born, developing, decaying, and eventually dying. In real life, only at very rare occasions can one afford to stop and think like Rodin’s character, solitary and isolated on a rock. In real life, one needs to move, to interact, to change, to fall, to get up and fall again. Most of the time, we need to think on the fly while acting and interacting with the world and others. Also, we are rarely alone, and we are never just abstract minds, we are deeply embodied creatures, driven by hunger and longing to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is this piece about how eating salads and connecting with your mother is more important than thinking? In a way, yes. You can exist without thinking, but you can’t exist (for very long) without eating or connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly: one can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing. Experiences come to the surface of being through the body, and not through the minds, or some sort of homunculus sitting in our heads, trying to ‘make sense’ of a world he doesn’t see, because the world is hidden in the black box of the scalp. We don’t perceive the world through some sort of inner solitary lens situated in our heads. We perceive the world through every single cell of our body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because human bodies first develop within another human body, at the beginning of our life, we perceive the world literally through another body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;This is what thinking is for: dealing with the messy jungle of life rather than the clean space of chess-playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pregnancy, (at least) two immune systems need to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-pregnancy-is-a-biological-war-between-mother-and-baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;negotiate the exchange&lt;/a&gt; of resources and information in order to maintain viable self-regulation of nested systems. The relationship, and the interactions between the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; self-organising systems during pregnancy may play a pivotal role in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understanding&lt;/a&gt; the nature of biological self-organisation per se in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was traditionally assumed that the placenta and the fetus are non-active immunological organs – largely depending on the maternal immune system – recent work suggests a more complex picture. The placenta and the fetus represent an ‘additional immunological organ which affects the global response of the mother to microbial infections,’ as the physiology researchers Gil Mor and Ingrid Cardenas &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367629/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. The type of response initiated in the placenta may determine the immunological response of the mother, impacting the pregnancy outcome. The placenta represents an active immunological organ, highly responsive to foreign pathogens. For example, it has been shown that the placenta functions as a regulator of, rather than a barrier to, the trafficking between the fetus and the mother. Both the fetus and the placenta present an active immune system that has a direct effect on the way the mother responds to the environment. Importantly for our discussion here, the placental-immune system creates a pregnancy-friendly protective environment while still being fully operational and able to defend the mother and fetus against infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is always a collective decision and a collective endeavour. If this is so, then why are we focusing on solitary brains and high-level cognitive abilities such as chess-playing to understand cognition? The radical claim here is that a creature with neurons only cannot develop, act and survive in the wild. And, ultimately, this is what thinking is for: successfully dealing with the messy and unpredictable jungle of life rather than with the clean and predictable space of chess-playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;erhaps all those modern obsessions about thinking and neural models of cognition were built to raise high the ceiling of our pure minds protecting us from the impure, messy and constantly dying and birthing cells of our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we are experiencing and cognising the world with every single cell in our entire body, not just the maestro brain? All our humble bodily cells participate in the making of our experiences and cognitive processes, and not just the ‘noble’ neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this really mean that we need our whole body to think? Surely I can cut off my toe, say, and still think? So what exactly is meant by saying that cognition is not in &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt; and that I need the whole body? However, the really important question is: was your body ‘dumb’ before you had a brain? If so, how did you manage to survive without neurons? Who did the smart heavy lifting of information-processing for survival, to allow brains to grow properly in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that famous Rodin sculpture was supposed to represent not a philosopher, but a poet – &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-fractal-consciousness-of-dantes-divine-comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dante, the author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;. The artist represented the poet sitting at the door of the Inferno and other worlds, contemplating &lt;em&gt;the space in between&lt;/em&gt;, the border, the passage between life and death. Perhaps what Rodin was trying to show us was that the meaning of all this lies not hidden inside one’s head, but in what lies &lt;em&gt;in between &lt;/em&gt;us, the world, and others. And here I say that this fascinating ‘in between’, for which we don’t have a word in our Western societies yet, starts already in the womb, with the placenta, the mysterious messy bridge that brings life to life through another’s living body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQVl1aks5MG0zR05WVF9zVnBEZDN1U1BCR1BTN29JQW55S3JXNmZENS1zRlctWkNZM3VmdzZRWHZrRUk2bTRGekhXUDk2UmxGS3MzT19JRjBoVlVNbEM2QzloaHJCTWRsX1ozRW1JZ2dQZmZzN0ZOZ0NVSi0tQWFQc19SS1Q</guid></item><item><title>基因疗法为患有致命“泡泡男孩病”的婴儿提供了治疗方法-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/27/well/bubble-boy-disease-gene-therapy.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:00:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOVkpWVjF1UVBFbDBNbmU5ajU3NDItTXk5bzZkdFFoZnZ2clhCVEwtWUhDNW5vX0lxdE9Ga2VCOG16YUZ6bkswVWZRUGNZcFJ4bDBwMjdJaTlLdUNYc0pTSmhYTV84aGR3V1haNzh4UnVreU5ZR1VGZ2dGa09JNTcwOWF3</guid></item><item><title>拥有22年经验的癌症外科医生分享了简单的饮食技巧和禁食技巧，可以降低您的癌症风险|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cancer-surgeon-with-22-years-of-experience-shares-simple-diet-hacks-and-fasting-tips-that-can-lower-your-cancer-risk-101764220745585.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101764220745585 " data-vars-storyid="101764220745585" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Akanksha Agnihotri" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set" data-story-title="Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares simple diet hacks and fasting tips that can lower your cancer risk" data-collapse-article="true"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares simple diet hacks and fasting tips that can lower your cancer risk&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Published on: Nov 27, 2025 12:34 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;What you eat daily can affect cancer risk.

He explains, “When you fast, your body and cells get time to heal. During fasting, cells enter a maintenance mode, which helps the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/immune-system" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="immune system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; function better and removes damaged or negative cells. This repair process is essential for overall health and cellular rejuvenation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="embed_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Addressing a common misconception, Dr Krishna warns, “Many people believe that a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/common-mistakes-people-make-on-ketogenic-diet-101717249033947.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="ketogenic diet"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; can cure cancer. That’s not true. The body only enters a ketogenic state when it is necessary, and following such a diet blindly can be harmful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is ketogenic diet always safe for cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasises the importance of personalised guidance: “Only consider a ketogenic diet if your cell or gene expression indicates it would be beneficial. Half knowledge can be dangerous and may do more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Krishna adds that while intermittent fasting can support cellular repair, immune health, and metabolic balance, it should always be approached thoughtfully. “Incorporating &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fasting" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fasting"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; into your routine can be beneficial, but it must be done under professional supervision, especially for individuals with specific health conditions or those undergoing cancer treatment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

&lt;p id="3fc7b1b9-1e01-419f-9c8f-f2a4b1963b9d"&gt;Exercising in your 40s and 50s might do more for your brain than you think. A 40-year study of thousands of adults found that people who stayed active in midlife and later life had up to a 45% lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841638" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841638" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; used a self-reported physical activity index to measure how much time people spent in slight, moderate, or heavy activity. While the research didn't find one intensity to be the single most effective, being regularly active at any level in your 40s and 50s was linked to better brain health later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="3fc7b1b9-1e01-419f-9c8f-f2a4b1963b9d-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That could mean regularly taking the stairs instead of the lift, a quick lunchtime walk, or a few sets with a pair of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/best-adjustable-dumbbells" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-redirect="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-adjustable-dumbbells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/best-adjustable-dumbbells"&gt;best adjustable dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; at home.

During the follow-up, 567 participants were diagnosed with dementia, helping researchers understand how activity at different ages can support brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clearest benefits were seen in midlife and later life. People who were most active in midlife had a 41% lower risk of dementia, and those who remained active in later life had a 45% lower risk. The findings suggest that moving more in your 40s, 50s and beyond can really help keep your memory and thinking sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="6f3653f7-420f-49bc-966e-98ad8a8468a1"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="f9c2663c-efd8-4b2b-89e3-85665befeb70"&gt;Exercise in early adulthood didn't show a clear link to dementia risk in this study. That doesn't mean being active when you are younger isn't worth your time. Staying fit early on still boosts heart health, mood and energy. But the good news is that it is never too late to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-kind-of-exercise-counts" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-kind-of-exercise-counts"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What kind of exercise counts?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="17e805e6-6f7b-44d9-a3b3-22a0ef4ffe1d"&gt;You don’t need to be a gym regular to give your brain a boost. Any activity that raises your heart rate a little and challenges your muscles can help, and making a habit of it is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-stbdAgHATFtd2n3TmhreNQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-stbdAgHATFtd2n3TmhreNQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be a brisk walk around your local park, a few laps in the pool, getting out and about on one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-electric-bikes" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-electric-bikes"&gt;best electric bikes&lt;/a&gt;, or even following an online exercise class at home. Strength work matters too, and it can be as simple as lifting some light weights, doing wall push-ups, or practicing sit-to-stands from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re more likely to stick with exercise if it’s something you enjoy or feel good about afterward. Start with manageable sessions and slowly build up from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="707798fd-3f59-4399-b72f-6ce3befcd2b9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" rel="nofollow" id="f5bff018-ff33-4332-a69f-90e8aa6d8486" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check=""&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0c32b581-db38-48dc-9710-d179b1b06b3a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="df6605bf-91e4-438b-8f54-62fa7fd068ae"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-more-from-tom-s-guide" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a id="elk-19344420-b190-4b5a-87fd-5f0a827929c7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="NordicTrack Select-A-Weight Dumbbell Set,Bowflex SelectTech 552i,Amazon Basics Adjustable Barbell Dumbbells,Ativafit Adjustable Dumbbells,Flybird Adjustable Dumbbell,,Core Home Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells &amp;amp; Stand,,Tespon Adjustable Dumbbells 66lbs" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-root"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep within your bone marrow, a specialized set of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; is busy pumping out &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-origins-of-our-blood-are-not-what-we-thought-mouse-study-suggests"&gt;new blood cells&lt;/a&gt; to sustain your body. As we age, these &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"&gt;hematopoietic stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (or HSCs) become less productive, affecting our immune system and increasing our risk of conditions like anemia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have found a way to rewind the clock in aging HSCs, which could potentially help to treat age-related blood and immune deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most of our cells, HSCs contain tiny compartments known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"&gt;lysosomes&lt;/a&gt;. These are the cells' recycling centers, where complex molecules like proteins and lipids are sent to be broken down into smaller, reusable parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/embryo-like-blood-factories-could-one-day-supplement-donations"&gt;Embryo-Like 'Blood Factories' Could One Day Supplement Donations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that many of the problems that arise in elderly HSCs are due to lysosomes gone haywire, as revealed in a new study by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US and Paris Cité University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stem cell&lt;/a&gt; biologist Saghi Ghaffari led experiments in mice to find that the lysosomes in the HSCs of elderly mice were extremely acidic and downright dysfunctional. HSCs collected from old mice were in overdrive, ramping up the cell's glucose metabolism and messing with the way the cell activates and uses genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hyperactivity is the opposite of how young HSCs behave: They are renowned for their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.09.029"&gt;quiescence&lt;/a&gt;, a reversible pause button that grants cells a period of stability and longevity by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.16472"&gt;avoiding stress and DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible. Quiescence also makes young HSCs more potent blood cell producers when re-awakened than aged cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghaffari and team were able to 'quieten' the distressed, elderly lysosomes in old HSCs with a chemical named &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Concanamycin-a"&gt;concanamycin A&lt;/a&gt;, which returned their pH and activity levels to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By removing the HSCs from mice and treating them with the chemical before returning the cells to their owners, the tissue's ability to produce new blood cells increased eight times over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their lysosomes stabilized, old stem cells began to behave more 'youthfully', too. Their ability to regenerate improved, and they resumed blood cell production in appropriate ratios, reversing the old HSCs' tendency to reduce the immune system's efficiency by producing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V100.4.1302.h81602001302_1302_1309"&gt;more of certain cells&lt;/a&gt; than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings reveal that aging in blood stem cells is not an irreversible fate. Old blood stem cells have the capacity to revert to a youthful state; they can bounce back," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By slowing down the lysosomes and reducing their acidity, stem cells became healthier and could make new, balanced blood cells and new stem cells much more effectively. By targeting lysosomal hyperactivity, we were able to reset aged stem cells to a younger, healthier state, improving their ability to regenerate blood and immune cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elderly HSCs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2012-0033"&gt;aren't highly suitable candidates&lt;/a&gt; for stem cell transplants, but the stem cells treated with concanamycin A appeared rejuvenated and were successfully transplanted in an animal model, suggesting a similar &lt;em&gt;ex vivo &lt;/em&gt;treatment could be used to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-key-to-creating-blood-stem-cells-may-lie-in-your-own-blood"&gt;improve the success&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/turns-out-that-bone-marrow-isn-t-the-only-place-in-our-body-we-make-blood-cells"&gt;human stem cell transplants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, further testing will be needed as the study only focused on how this all works in the cells of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lysosomal dysfunction emerges as a central driver of stem cell aging," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting this pathway may one day help maintain healthy blood and immune systems in the elderly, improve their stem cells for transplantation, and reduce the risk of age-associated blood disorders and perhaps have an effect on overall aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.10.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

are replacements for medication like Ozempic, here are the five foods which are said to have properties that 'mimic' the GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to researchers from Heliopolis University and Al-Azhar University in Egypt, ginger and its chemical constituent gingerol could help the production of GLP-1, meaning that it reduces hyperglycemia in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This health condition is synonymous with people who have diabetes or prediabetes, and consists of increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and even blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Hyperglycemia can be caused by a lack of insulin, a high-carbohydrate diet, and/or &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mental-health"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The popular spice was found to reduce the condition in diabetic mice, as the study stated: “New research suggests that ginger and its chemical constituent gingerol may induce GLP-1 production, which in turn has a hypoglycemic impact, explaining why ginger has long been prescribed to diabetic patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cinnamon is a popular spice which is known for its ability to maintain stable blood sugar levels, as researchers noted that it can 'lower blood sugar and blood pressure levels' in Toxicology reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It can help to increase GLP-1 sensitivity or boost its release from the intestines, as the experts explained: “Isolated cinnamon components enhance insulin-dependent glucose metabolism, according to in vitro research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Just three grams of cinnamon can cause GLP-1 levels to jump in healthy people, though it should be noted that taking too much of it can prove toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berberine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is a lesser-known &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/food-and-drink"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; ingredient which is found in a number of plants, though it has been described as the nearest thing to 'natural Ozempic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to a 2022 review of 18 studies, a berberine supplement resulted in reduced body weight, BMI, fasting blood glucose and LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It works by increasing insulin production by activating bitter taste receptors in the intestines, which decreases body weight and lipids, increasing GLP-1 in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A daily cup of green tea could make all the difference, according to the study (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wheat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Wheat protein hydrolysate is a protein which is derived from wheat when broken down and it contains high amounts of amino acids and peptides, which can lower blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It does this by releasing GLP-1, which can also help to reduce hyperglycemia according to past studies, say the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermented green tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's said that fermenting tea with a culture of bacteria and yeast, which can form kombucha, can make a drink which 'mimics' Ozempic. This is because of compounds that are found in green tea particularly, primarily epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant known for its inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A 2018 study &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464618302470"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that this can even stimulate GLP-1 release if taken with caffeine, after a study on mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A cup of green tea alone can enhance methods of treating diabetes, with a daily dose can help to stimulate characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 03:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOUUowQmNmOTEySjc3eHBwamF3R3g4djhtR245cUhGT2p4U1JFM2FYNW5JV0toVUxybG95ZDdmemF3QWlfNHVjV1phNWN3c2VkQTB3TzF4U1Z2LThQS2VSOEdoM0s2NkJoc25jTXhRREZqRXdiZHl1bHJrcFRqalI4LTB4R3ltTElKVnIzTkFOMTN2N1hDYV9YU2VKXzlBaGc4</guid></item><item><title>忘记药物：血糖专家揭示预防2型糖尿病的日常家庭习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/forget-medicine-blood-sugar-experts-reveal-daily-home-habits-to-prevent-type-2-diabetes/articleshow/125582096.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the secret to protecting your family from Type 2 diabetes was not found in a clinic but in your everyday routines including your dinner table, your evening walks, even your bedtime habits? Doctors say that prevention begins long before medication does and often with the simplest moments like moving together, eating better, sleeping well and learning to hit pause on stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world continues to experience one of the fastest rises in type 2 diabetes, Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran, Consultant - Internal Medicine at Rela Hospital in Chennai, note in an interview with the Times of India, “Even young individuals are prone to develop Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The current scenario is such that no age is safe anymore. Diabetes now affects teenagers, young adults and even children.” While genetics play a major role, he asserted that the contributing factors apart from genetic susceptibility are consumption of junk food, not eating on time, physical activity, childhood obesity, stress and lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts insist that small, daily lifestyle habits can reduce this risk dramatically. Evidence from global research echoes their advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move together: Making physical activity fun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr R Sundararaman, General Medicine, Senior Consultant – Internal Medicine at SIMS Hospitals in Chennai, “Physical activities and exercise help to manage weight, improve metabolism and keeps insulin levels stable. Families that exercise together stay healthier and happy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits multiply not just for health but also happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

A major &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-016-4079-0" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2016 pooled analysis published in Diabetologia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that even 150 minutes of brisk walking per week lowered Type 2 diabetes risk by up to 26%. The researchers found, “Higher levels of total physical activity were associated with a significantly lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this can be as simple as evening walks, cycling together, weekend swimming sessions or short dance workouts at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Managing screen time: Digital discipline for all ages&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman warned that excessive screen time, in both children and adults, creates a cycle of inactivity, overeating and disrupted sleep. “Too much screen time promotes an inactive lifestyle and encourages irregular eating and sleep patterns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global research confirms this. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6688457" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2021 study in the Journal of Diabetes Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that prolonged screen time was directly associated with higher BMI and poorer glycaemic indicators in adults. The researchers revealed, “Longer screen time was significantly linked with obesity and increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman recommended simple screen-time discipline strategies that include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting a daily limit to use phones if not for educational purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid screen time while eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace casual screen times with reading books and other activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a no-screens-one-hour-before-bed rule as it disturbs your sleep time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress management: Protecting both mind and metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress significantly affects blood sugar. Dr Sundararaman explained, “Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which raises blood glucose levels. Teaching children to manage emotions early builds lifelong resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aligns with evidence from a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.04.012" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2017 study published in Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which showed that stress-induced cortisol spikes impair the body’s ability to regulate glucose, increasing diabetes risk. The study established, “Higher cortisol responses were associated with an increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman advised healthy stress-management habits that families can adopt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 minutes of daily deep-breathing or guided meditation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritising consistent sleep (7–8 hours)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily “unplugged” family time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open communication without digital distractions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition: Small swaps that make a big difference&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran emphasised how dietary patterns shape metabolic health from childhood onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Minor changes in lifestyle, especially food choices, play an important role in preventing diabetes. Whole grains like brown rice, wheat and millets, along with low-GI foods such as sweet potatoes and beans, are extremely helpful,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Research consistently shows that overweight children are far more likely to develop diabetes as adults, underlining the need for active playtime, screen-time limits and balanced meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep: The most underrated prevention tool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts echo the same advice: 7–8 hours of sleep every night.

			&lt;p&gt;Can tattoos protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, or do they make things worse? A new study I conducted with colleagues suggests there may be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that people with tattoos had a 29% higher risk of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183256" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; often linked to ultraviolet (UV) exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tattoos did not appear to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma, another type of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/skin-cancer-1260"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; related to UV damage. Although both cancers share a common cause, they arise from different cell types and differ in severity, with melanoma being far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/could-a-tattoo-raise-your-risk-of-skin-cancer-twin-studies-suggest-a-link"&gt;Could a Tattoo Raise Your Risk of Skin Cancer? Twin Studies Suggest a Link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattoos are a powerful form of self-expression and a cornerstone of modern identity. In Sweden, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckaf178/8323409"&gt;around one in three adults&lt;/a&gt; is tattooed, showing how body art has moved firmly into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite their popularity, scientists still do not know whether tattoos have any impact on health, or how any potential effects might unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists are now trying to answer these questions. The work is challenging because people who choose to get tattoos often differ from those who do not in ways that can influence health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty is that most health records do not note whether someone is tattooed, which means long-term patterns are hard to study. Without this basic information, it becomes difficult to know whether tattoos themselves play a role in health or whether differences are driven by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma both develop slowly and are relatively uncommon, which makes long-term research challenging. Following large groups of tattooed and non-tattooed people for many years would be expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-025-01326-6"&gt;So our team used a different approach&lt;/a&gt;. We started with people who had already been diagnosed with cancer and looked backward to see who had tattoos. This type of research, known as a case-control study, is an efficient way to detect potential associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden maintains high-quality national registers that record information on health and demographics. From &lt;a href="https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/statistics-and-data/registers/national-cancer-register/"&gt;the National Cancer Register&lt;/a&gt;, we identified everyone aged 20 to 60 who was diagnosed with melanoma in 2017 or squamous cell carcinoma between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included 2,880 melanoma cases and 2,821 squamous cell carcinoma cases. For each case, we selected three comparison people of the same age and sex from the Total Population Register, who had not been diagnosed with skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then sent questionnaires to all participants, asking about tattoos, including decorative tattoos, permanent makeup and medical tattoos, as well as their size, location, and age at first tattoo. This allowed us to establish whether someone had been tattooed before or after developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,695 people took part in the melanoma study (1,598 with melanoma) and 6,151 in the squamous cell carcinoma study (1,600 with that cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with tattoos were 29% more likely to develop melanoma compared with those without tattoos. The risk increase seemed to be highest in those who had tattoos for more than ten years, although the numbers were smaller in this group, so results should be interpreted cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For squamous cell carcinoma, tattoos made no difference. The results were consistent across analyses, suggesting no link between tattoos and this type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found no evidence that larger tattoos increased risk. This was unexpected, since larger tattoos contain more ink and therefore more potentially harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that tattoo ink does not remain confined to the skin. The body's immune system treats it as a foreign substance and transports some ink &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28900193/"&gt;particles to the lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles can stay there long-term. While we do not yet know whether this causes harm, it could potentially lead to chronic inflammation, which has been linked to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation may be measurement error: people tend to overestimate tattoo size. Future studies using more precise measures may help clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle and confounding factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study unique is the range of lifestyle factors we could consider. We included data on sun exposure (both occupational and recreational), tanning bed use, smoking, education level, marital status and household income. We also factored in skin type, pigmentation, age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These details matter because they can influence both who gets tattoos and who develops cancer. For instance, people who spend a lot of time in the sun may be more likely to have tattoos and to develop melanoma. Accounting for these differences reduces bias and strengthens confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research, this issue is known as confounding. If &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/confounding-factors"&gt;confounding factors&lt;/a&gt; are not properly controlled, they can distort findings and lead to misleading conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djaf235/8239343"&gt;US research&lt;/a&gt; suggested that large tattoos might even reduce the risk of melanoma, but that study did not control for key factors such as skin type or UV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may therefore reflect behaviour rather than biology. For example, people with large tattoos may avoid sunbathing or tanning beds to protect their body art, which would naturally reduce UV damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-linked-to-increased-cancer-risk-scientists-warn"&gt;Tattoos Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do tattoos cause skin cancer? The simple answer is that we do not know yet. Our results suggest a possible link between tattoos and melanoma, but one study is never enough to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to explore potential biological mechanisms, such as chronic inflammation, and to examine how different types of ink or colours might interact with UV exposure. The composition of tattoo pigments varies widely, and many contain compounds that can break down into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833639/"&gt;harmful by-products&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight or laser removal treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have tattoos, there is no need for panic, but awareness matters. Continue to protect your skin from UV radiation just as you would otherwise: use sunscreen, avoid excessive tanning and check your skin regularly for new or changing moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlight the need for long-term monitoring and better data collection on tattoos in health records. With tattoos now common worldwide, this is an important public health issue. Continued research into the biology of tattoos and their long-term effects will help ensure that people can make informed choices about their bodies, their art and their health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266809/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A third had stopped taking steroids after six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness. Up to 10% of asthmatics have severe disease and, in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial findings, published in the the Lancet Respiratory Medicine and presented at the British Thoracic Society winter meeting, also showed that tezepelumab significantly improved asthma symptoms, lung function and overall quality of life.

                        &lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving brings together families, friends, and, of course, plenty of food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those feeling uncomfortably full after the feast, a viral social media hack dubbed the “fart walk” offers sweet relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fart walk is exactly what it sounds like: a walk outside to relieve gas after eating a large meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term was first used by 70-year-old cookbook author Mairlyn Smith on social media, who would talk about walking after dinner to pass gas, according to a post by &lt;a href="https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/body/food/fart-walks-digestion-blood-sugar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UW Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@mairlynthequeenoffibre/video/7347372738929020166" data-video-id="7347372738929020166"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People then started posting their own #fartwalk videos. Even &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; joined in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A fart walk is a gastroenterologist-approved method for reducing bloating after eating,” the media outlet wrote in its Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRVdmFYj0nY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UW Medicine noted different cultures have been taking walks after dinner for centuries. For example, Italians call it la passeggiata, and China has an ancient proverb stating that those who take 100 steps after a meal will live to be 99.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of ‘fart walks’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christopher Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at UW Medical Center, said moving around helps digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moving your body will help stimulate and open up your bowels,” he told UW Medicine. “Whether or not you’d rather pass the gas while you’re outdoors or inside or exercising or not, that is your prerogative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking helps the stomach empty more quickly, mitigates bloating, and can help reduce acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of a fart walk, UW Medicine recommends getting outside within an hour of eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="e1728373-1370-4549-9391-cf3844cea808"&gt;Scientists are connecting the dots between stress and hair loss, including a common condition that causes hair to fall out in large patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High stress weighs heavily on the body — it can impact sleep, make the heart pound, and cause pains and muscle aches. It's also been tied to hair loss, such as the chronic hair-loss condition &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12423-alopecia-areata" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12423-alopecia-areata" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alopecia areata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which immune cells attack hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="e1728373-1370-4549-9391-cf3844cea808-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Anecdotally, this condition is often preceded by stress, but scientists have been unable to convincingly show that one leads to the other. Now, a new study published Wednesday (Nov. 26) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.10.042" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.10.042" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has finally joined the dots through a series of mouse experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1fd2c3ae-b2e2-435c-83f2-9d8271d3067f"&gt;"I've always been fascinated by how life experiences leave marks on our bodies," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/ya-chieh-hsu-phd" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/ya-chieh-hsu-phd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ya-Chieh Hsu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a regenerative biologist at Harvard University, told Live Science in an email. "We still know surprisingly little about how stress reshapes our tissues and contributes to disease." But hair cells offer an accessible and informative model for studying how stress affects the body, said Hsu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ceb48d9e-52a1-487d-a75f-90162c05eb04" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="stress-gets-on-your-nerves-3"&gt;Stress gets on your nerves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6bd9bc59-7485-4636-9ebc-a951c7f2def9"&gt;Both alopecia areata and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24486-telogen-effluvium" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24486-telogen-effluvium" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;telogen effluvium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — another stress-related hair loss condition — affect growing hair cells. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=101509" target="_blank" data-url="https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=101509" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;100,000 or so hairs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on each person's head cannot be produced directly by stem cells; instead, they are grown by rapidly-reproducing "hair follicle transit-amplifying cells," or HF-TACs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsu and her colleagues thought HF-TACs might be particularly vulnerable to stress. That's because stress reflects the body shifting into "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/65446-sympathetic-nervous-system.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/65446-sympathetic-nervous-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fight-or-flight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" mode, in which non-essential processes, like hair growth, are relegated in favor of metabolic processes essential to survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors used a mouse model to test how HF-TACs responded to short-term stressors. The researchers injected mice with resiniferatoxin, a chemical similar to capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their kick. Within 24 hours, the mice had lost 30% of their hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LMhsTHrKqPiASCMTcYhMKV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LMhsTHrKqPiASCMTcYhMKV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team knew that resiniferatoxin injections activate the sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response. They noticed that regions of the mice's skin in which more HF-TACs died were especially enriched with sympathetic nerve fibers. Blocking signals through these nerves stopped the hair loss. Additionally, blocking receptors on HF-TACs that respond to norepinephrine — a chemical released by active sympathetic nerves — also prevented hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that the fast-growing cells rely heavily on their inbuilt powerhouses, the mitochondria, to support their rapid growth. But surges in norepinephrine activate receptors that then flood these mitochondria with calcium ions, meaning charged particles of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sudden calcium surge damages these mitochondria," Hsu said. "Once this happens, the cells lose their ability to maintain essential functions — such as energy production and ion balance — and they rupture." This, in turn, kills the hair cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair cells don't live forever under normal conditions. Instead, they enter a tightly-controlled stage called "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/why-do-we-lose-so-much-hair" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/why-do-we-lose-so-much-hair"&gt;&lt;u&gt;catagen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," in which many cells in a follicle die before the follicle resets for a new growth cycle. Cells killed by stress, in contrast, appear to die through an uncontrolled process called necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsu's team saw that necrosis triggered rampant inflammation in the nearby area, and that mice showed increased immune cell levels in their lymph nodes. Importantly, these new cells were self-reactive, meaning they were primed and ready to attack the mice's own tissues. The researchers showed that these cells could then infiltrate hair bulbs and damage them — as is seen in alopecia areata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d3e77265-c25c-44de-aef1-2bd9469ce51b"&gt;But another mystery of conditions like alopecia areata is that patients can experience hair loss for years after the stressful incident that kicked off their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look into this, the team allowed some of their stressed-out mice to calm down, and their hair cells to re-enter the growth phase. They exposed the mice to an inflammatory signal, like they might experience during an infection. This inflammation caused immune cells to once again attack the hair bulbs. But in mice that hadn't been stressed earlier, this immune activation did not lead to hair bulb damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This provides a possible explanation for why some individuals experience alopecia that recurs long after the initial stress episode," said Hsu. These mechanisms also likely contribute to other forms of stress-related hair loss, she added, including telogen effluvium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition, many people experience hair thinning or shedding in [a] stressful period that is not formally diagnosed," she noted. "It is possible that some milder, under-recognized forms of stress-linked hair loss may share components of the pathways we describe as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the study is in lab mice, mapping the mechanism points to several steps where medical interventions could potentially reduce the impact of stress- and autoimmunity-related hair loss. Hsu is interested in exploring such treatments in future work, and also intends to explore how stress might contribute to other autoimmune conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is much more to learn — not only in the skin, but across many organ systems," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="52d58fb5-1d95-4a38-9df1-1bce0e123abe"&gt;

&lt;div class="tdb-block-inner td-fix-index"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) acknowledged Wednesday that the controversial &lt;a href="https://monseyscoop.com/outrageous-robocall-rockland-county-sends-unauthorized-measles-alert-misusing-hatzolohs-name/"&gt;measles-related robocall sent to thousands of Ramapo residents did not match the message previously discussed with Hatzoloh of Rockland&lt;/a&gt;, despite the two organizations having coordinated on a general vaccination reminder ahead of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCDOH said it had worked with Hatzolah on crafting a notification, but “the message that was agreed upon was not what was ultimately sent out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We regret how it played out,” the department added, noting that officials are reviewing the incident “to ensure it does not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsey Scoop reached out to Hatzoloh, which said they appreciate the county’s clarification and “hope to work together going forward to ensure the right messaging is communicated to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county also reminded residents that free measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations will be available next week through the RCDOH Mobile Vaccination Van:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, December 2&lt;br&gt;
10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccines are also available at local healthcare providers, including Refuah Health and Sun River Health, or by calling the Rockland County Department of Health at 845-364-2497 or 845-364-2520.&lt;/p&gt;

Utah experts advise a radon test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think about family history, genetics, or age when they think about Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those factors are well known, researchers are now studying whether long-term exposure to certain environmental conditions may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those conditions is radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas found throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah health and environmental experts encourage residents to pay attention to radon levels in their homes, especially because radon exposure builds slowly over time and can go unnoticed for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test kit at &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_top" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon forms naturally as uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It moves upward and can enter homes through small openings in foundations, basements, crawl spaces and utility gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon has no color, taste, or odor, so homeowners cannot detect it without a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the [Envionmental Protection Agency](Envionmental Protection Agency), long-term radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has a higher radon potential than many other states due to its unique geology. Recent data shows that almost half of all Utah homes have elevated radon levels, underscoring the importance of routine testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do we know about Alzheimer's risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients are 65 and older, and the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. Genetics, family history and certain heart and blood vessel conditions may also contribute to increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Beaunitta Van Wyk/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say about radon and cognitive health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to study whether long-term exposure to radon may affect neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671130/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Environmental Health Perspectives found evidence that ionizing radiation may contribute to cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's. The authors noted that these effects may accumulate over many years of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because radon exposure is preventable, Utah residents have an opportunity to reduce one potential environmental risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is simple. Families can order a free test kit from &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_mid" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why radon testing matters for Utah families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Utah homeowners who test their homes are surprised by their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon has no symptoms and no noticeable signs, homes with elevated levels often appear completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is straightforward. UtahRadon.org provides free test kits to all Utah residents. The test only takes a few minutes to place in the home and is then mailed to a certified third-party laboratory for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If your home tests high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels can be reduced by installing a mitigation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are installed by certified professionals and are designed to continuously vent radon from beneath the home to the outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most installations are completed in a single visit and begin lowering radon levels immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is invisible and odorless, but it is measurable, and homeowners have control over their exposure. Testing allows families to understand their risk and take action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test by visiting &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_bottom" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

That work also tied long term NSAID exposure to more cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-study-did-differently"&gt;What this study did differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of testing one treatment at a time, Luo’s team compared many therapies at once. They used a network meta-analysis, a method that combines results from many trials, so treatments can be ranked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the comparison, researchers pooled 139 trials that tested 12 non-drug options for knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those trials examined laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, taping, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, and several exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined standard rating scales that scored pain, stiffness, and day to day function. Those scores let them estimate which options worked best overall without letting any single small study dominate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions,” said Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-braces-shift-the-load"&gt;How braces shift the load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A knee brace for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is usually a rigid or semi rigid device that wraps around the joint. By changing how body weight passes through the knee, the brace can take pressure off the worn compartment and reduce irritation of sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical research on unloader braces, rigid supports that relieve pressure from one side of the knee, shows clear short term pain relief. Several trials also report better function and longer walking distance when people use these braces consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overview of 14 brace studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6028281/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that many users experienced better overall quality of life while they wore the device. The authors also found early signs that bracing could delay knee replacement for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braces have drawbacks, including bulk, skin irritation, and the hassle of wearing them for hours per day. Real world studies suggest many people stop using their brace or wear it only briefly, so comfort and fit can influence success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-water-and-exercise-matter"&gt;Why water and exercise matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrotherapy involves guided exercise in warm water that supports body weight and lets joints move with less impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955208/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of aquatic exercise programs found that water based sessions reduce pain and joint dysfunction for people with osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those benefits were especially clear for participants who struggled to tolerate land based workouts because of pain or poor balance. In Luo’s ranking, hydrotherapy rose to the top when a combined arthritis score was used, capturing gains in pain, stiffness, and daily function together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits reports from pool programs that work with older adults who have knee arthritis. In warm water, they can practice balance, strength, and walking drills without the sharp jolts they feel on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land based exercise also remains a central part of care for people with knee osteoarthritis. Walking, strengthening, simple balance drills, supervised sessions, and support for weight and self management are all strongly recommended in major clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What this means for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ranking supports a model where braces, exercise, and hydrotherapy sit at the center of long term care. In that approach, medications are used carefully as add ons, not the automatic first line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these physical treatments shift load, strengthen muscles, and retrain movement patterns, they aim at causes of pain rather than only numbing signals. That focus on mechanics and strength can matter more than short courses of pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International bodies now encourage combinations of non drug and drug therapies tailored to each person with knee symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibiofemoral bracing and structured exercise sit among the most strongly endorsed options for painful knee osteoarthritis. Practical care plans often layer a brace for high demand activities with regular supervised exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pool time when available and short courses of medication during symptom flares are added instead of escalating straight to injections or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-to-learn-about-osteoarthritis"&gt;More to learn about osteoarthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/womans-knee-pain-caused-by-the-presence-of-gold-threads-in-her-joints/"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt; can ask their clinician whether an unloading brace or a supervised exercise program is appropriate for their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also ask about referral to aquatic therapy when their balance, weight, or other conditions make land exercise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about brace fit, how many hours to wear it, and which exercises are safe help tailor treatment and may improve comfort and adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific goals, such as hiking, kneeling, or climbing stairs for work, can guide which therapies deserve the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still need longer studies that follow brace users and exercise participants over several years. Those trials could reveal whether these approaches delay joint replacement and remain cost effective as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo and colleagues also note that combinations of therapies, such as bracing plus hydrotherapy, could prove more powerful than any single option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust trials of those treatment packages are still rare, so the best mix and timing remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0324864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:58:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNajRIdXFPeTNSZUEzYlRBdWhrbE01bDVWMWdNZXBmUWg3QzhIYmQ0YVNET09kNkYwdkR6d2F2X2UtR3MybUlQM2JrczFBcE5kOFU2dzg2MGlmODU0YlluVTZJVDYxQWJiVnJXNGZpV3Z0blFoX0x2Nm56YV9wOU92R2Q3QjZfdDVyZEdlWTNrekJNc2h1SVN1dHh5VU5wTHh3bE5HQ0hHOVI</guid></item><item><title>2026年推出的狗用抗衰老药？ FDA支持的药物须知|《印度斯坦时报》-《印度斯坦时报》</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new anti-aging pill for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/us/most-popular-dog-breed-of-2025-in-us-its-not-golden-retriever-101758291889420.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="dogs"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; that has the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fda" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;'s backing and is reportedly close to getting approval as well, several &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/regulating-social-media-for-children-101763999954648-amp.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="social media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; posts have claimed.

While the news of the pill has begun to do the rounds now, the company had shared an update about it in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;LOY-002, our program bringing longevity to dogs of almost all sizes, has also earned its formal FDA acceptance for reasonable expectation of efficacy (RXE),” the company announced in a blog post.&lt;/span&gt; The company noted there were two more primary FDA requirements for conditional approval. These are manufacturing and safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company had noted that it had extensive date supporting both and expressed a hope to have completed regulatory requirements by the end of 2025. This would make the FDA-approved longevity drug, which has been called anti-aging pill online, a reality for millions of dogs in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;WQHT or Hot 97 noted, “Loyal, a biotech company, has been developing a medication aimed at slowing aging in large-breed dogs, and early results indicate it may add more healthy years rather than extending the more fragile stage of life.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So far, the outlook is promising: a pilot study involving 48 dogs reported no adverse effects after three months of taking the drug,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“The longevity space is crowded right now, and for good reason. We all want to figure out how to get more happy, healthy years for our loved ones — especially the furry ones,” Celine Halioua, founder and CEO of Loyal had said in a June 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/health/new-longevity-drug-for-dogs-could-extend-your-pets-life/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the New York Post. In February, Halioua had said on X, “Loyal’s drug for senior dog lifespan extension drug LOY-002 has completed its FDA efficacy package (RXE). We are on track to hopefully bring the first longevity drug to market *this year*.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How the anti-aging pill for dogs work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Loyal, LOY-002 is a caloric restriction mimetic. This means, it delivers the benefits of caloric restriction through a drug, thus creating a situation where there is no weight loss or appetite suppression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This comes after a study showed that calorie-restricted dogs lived ~2 years longer that other furry fellows, and saw a delayed onset of cancer and osteoarthritis.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This pill will be for ‘senior’ dogs, Loyal noted, and they stated they're pursuing FDA approval for use in dogs 10 years and older and who weigh at least 14 lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着诺如病毒病例的增加，以下是关于今年传播的知识—以及如何保护自己- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55e861" class="body-graf"&gt;A nasty, highly contagious virus is spreading across the country ahead of the holiday season — and it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cold-and-flu/flu-season-just-beginning-doctors-are-already-high-alert-rcna245148" target="_blank"&gt;the flu&lt;/a&gt;

Between August and November 2024, there were 235 reported norovirus outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96bef7" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 153 outbreaks during the same time period this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ec07" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the same level of illnesses will continue into 2026, but outbreaks are expected to keep rising, Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-182ed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have three years of data to kind of show that we have this strong seasonal pattern,” she said. “But I can’t say right now how big of a peak it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2b81" class="body-graf"&gt;A CDC spokesperson said the agency is closely monitoring the norovirus season, which is most common from November to April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aef629" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC tracks norovirus through voluntary reporting from clinical laboratories and health departments, but doesn’t currently monitor for norovirus through wastewater, which may be a reason its tracking doesn’t match the WastewaterScan data. People may be sick, but not go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2725b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bidwell said wastewater is an “unbiased way of looking at what is happening in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a409e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what to know about norovirus and its spread this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d5e34" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus variant becoming more dominant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aabe29" class="body-graf"&gt;For over 30 years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" target="_blank"&gt;norovirus outbreaks have been dominated by one strain&lt;/a&gt;, GII.4. Last year’s outbreaks were &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank"&gt;overwhelmingly caused&lt;/a&gt; by the variant GII.17, making up around 75% of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c987" class="body-graf"&gt;The GII.17 strain has become more prevalent in several countries, including the United States, through the 2020s. The rise of GII.17 may explain why the 2024 spikes and this year’s spread started earlier in October, instead of winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b60133" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said a combination of factors may have led to GII.17’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-033782" class="body-graf"&gt;“The two possibilities is that something in the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or there were changes in the population that a larger proportion were susceptible,” he said. “And probably it’s a combination of both. But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ea117" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Craig Wilen, associate professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at Yale University, said GII.17 may not actually be more transmissible, but many people probably have less immunity to the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-463d92" class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably the GII.17 last year was so effective at infecting so many people because we had significantly less immunity to that virus, since it was different enough from viruses that we’ve previously been infected with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to say how this year’s norovirus season will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28da7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Atmar said either variant has a “50/50 chance” of dominating this year, but doesn’t expect the same level of illnesses as last year because of “increased immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-82a035" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus symptoms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1eb627" class="body-graf"&gt;Norovirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious&lt;/a&gt;, human-only disease. Norovirus outbreaks can happen anywhere and cause around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;20 million infections&lt;/a&gt; a year. It’s responsible for over half of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-089da0" class="body-graf"&gt;It spreads from person to person through vomit or feces drops that end up in peoples’ mouths. It can also spread through coming in contact with contaminated food, water or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419a39" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;main symptoms &lt;/a&gt;are diarrhea and vomiting, earning it the name “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-treatment-guide-effective-methods-protection-rcna185872" target="_blank"&gt;two-bucket disease&lt;/a&gt;.” Other symptoms include fever, stomach pain and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac533" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea may require medical attention for older adults, young children and people with weakened immune systems, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4a90c" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually start within 12 to 48 hours after exposure and last for a few days. Someone can still spread the virus for more than two weeks, even after symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-687185" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect against norovirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus is notoriously difficult to kill. &lt;/a&gt;It’s difficult to wash away and can survive temperatures up to 145°F. Many scientists call it the “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1622/844989?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank"&gt;perfect pathogen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-771edb" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilen said norovirus is “highly stable in the environment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-781fa2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s highly infectious. Traditional ethanol-based hand sanitizers don’t work as well for this virus as they do for other viruses,” the Yale associate professor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-718222" class="body-graf"&gt;In order to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;kill norovirus&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC recommends washing your hands vigorously with soap, cleaning infected areas with diluted bleach and washing infected clothes with hot water and detergent. Wearing gloves and throwing them out after cleaning adds protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea55ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruits and vegetables should be properly cleaned, and oysters and shellfish are properly cooked can also reduce infection risk, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384c28" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a specific treatment for norovirus, but &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355302" target="_blank"&gt;rehydration is key to replace lost fluids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f6aa3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Though there’s currently no vaccine for norovirus, a &lt;a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-1403-P301" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 3 Moderna trial is in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:02:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNS0VTZF9xeFVJaVR3NHJIdEdvazNIbDRNLU5DVGtyLUNzTFNFZW4weE1SS1JGekRadVJUb25ZejJrZFh1Q2tCemp6RjhmZ3BWMlAzck9JUHphSng5OEZqNzNaTXJzemNyV3NRaVVQbUd0ZlZmYmttOWpUUHFZZHhIQk5RM1FvbmVleFdjOTltR2w3VFJtVkc0VHM4ZFBHUnE0Wk1RT2dnZ2dmdFZkd25pMGN0OVhORjZxc3fSAVZBVV95cUxPeHVYOUdNcjF3U183dW92THZaVVNsaWxDYUJrQkxqdWRDT3piZEd5Y1Bic1ZEeTlCRzZVNnpPZnJROU5zQmxHMGl4d1JFSUxQaUNzMWFTdw</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，肠道中产生的代谢产物在控制肥胖和糖尿病方面发挥着核心作用- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-metabolites-intestine-play-central-role.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost 30 years, GNN has been busting global media’s 24-hour gloom and doom cycle with the premise that bad news doesn’t have to sell, and good news isn’t rare at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case-in-point for this outlet’s publishing mission is a &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; recently released on Our World in Data that showed how bad news events like murder and terrorism are extraordinarily over-covered by American media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, homicide receives approximately 4,300% more media coverage than its share of deaths across the American population every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put differently, if every death in America was reported on, news stories on homicides would be fewer in number by a factor of 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study the same is true for terrorism—by a staggering 18,000 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relying on Media Cloud, an open-access platform for media analysis, the team behind the study analyzed news headlines covering the 12 most-common causes of death in America, plus homicide, drug overdoses, and terrorism, as these were perceived by the authors to receive an outsized share of media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then gathered news stories from three of the largest news outlets in America: the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the news website of Fox News. Their criteria was set to ensure the stories focused on these causes of death as the topic, rather than in passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heart disease and cancer accounted for 56% of deaths among these 15 causes, but together they received just 7% of the media coverage,” the study team, consisting of Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, found and wrote in their presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rare—but dramatic—events such as homicides and terrorism received more than half of all media coverage,” despite together representing less than 1% of all deaths in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_226012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226012" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-226012" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1024x677.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-326x215.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-768x507.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-696x460.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-1068x706.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-636x420.jpg 636w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License-530x350.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/credit-Ritchie-et-al-on-CC-BY-License.jpg 1135w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226012" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;– credit, Ritchie et al on CC-BY License&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug overdoses were also overrepresented—by 4-times their share of mortality events in the American population. Suicide was overrepresented by 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nearly six-in-ten Americans still see international terrorism as a critical threat to the United States, despite the domestic impact on the US being relatively low for two decades,” the authors write. Indeed, terrorism killed just 16 Americans last year, about half the number of Americans killed in &lt;a href="https://www.thedoanlawfirm.com/elevator-accidents-can-cause-significant-injuries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;elevator accidents&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not thinking twice about climbing into a rickety elevator, than you probably shouldn’t overly worry about terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAK THE BAD NEWS CYCLE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Instead of ‘We Are What We Eat,’ the Science of Kindness Says ‘We Are What We See’ in Daily Life" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/science-of-kindness-says-we-are-what-we-see/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Instead of ‘We Are What We Eat,’ the Science of Kindness Says ‘We Are What We See’ in Daily Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t appear to be down to a conspiracy in media, but rather because American reporters are just following the absolute basics of ‘storytelling’. Heart disease and cardiovascular events kill 2,000 Americans every day, so the headline would be the same as yesterday’s and the day before that, with little variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dramatic event like a plane crash or a gun battle in an American downtown area, has eye-witnesses, dramatic recounting, and enough individual details to make a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE POSITIVE HEADLINES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Five Top Headlines that Showcase the World’s Progress in the Climate Fight" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/top-five-2023-headlines-that-showcase-world-progress-on-climate-crisis-renewables-emissions-evs/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Five Top Headlines that Showcase the World’s Progress in the Climate Fight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritchie, Acisu, and Mathieu write that the vast majority of news consumers cite a motivation to be better informed, and to keep track of what’s happening in the world, as the reasons for their attention to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s clear that the number of news stories on a topic doesn’t actually reflect the overall state of a society, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking it does, and feel depressed because you’re led to believe life is full of malicious, despairing savagery.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many cancer doctors hope that tests like Galleri, which are sometimes called &lt;a href="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;“liquid biopsies,”&lt;/a&gt; will transform cancer care by detecting the earliest signs of malignancy, enabling treatment before the disease becomes deadly. They are part of an accelerating effort to find cancer earlier and earlier, through blood tests as well as new techniques and artificial intelligence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The goal is to take the same energy and skill that has been deployed to develop treatments for cancer, and put it to work at finding cancer early enough to stop it in its tracks, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How do we move from a reactive model where we are only picking up cancers when they declare themselves?” she said. O’Donnell is leading &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/clinical-trials/24-070" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of the Galleri test, recruiting 1,000 people at high risk for cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today, 70 percent of cancers have no screening test. People can be screened for cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and, for heavy smokers, lung. Other tumors often grow without symptoms and are discovered when it’s too late to effectively treat them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The path to catching more cancers early is fraught with challenges. To be most effective, screening has to do more than just detect cancer: It has to find the right cancer at the right moment. When a test turns up cancer so indolent it was never going to harm the patient, it only sows fear and can lead to needless procedures. When it finds a cancer that is so aggressive there’s no stopping it, its value can be limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You really want a screening test that finds the cancer and leads to the patient not dying,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, a noted expert in cancer prevention and control at Johns Hopkins University, who has consulted for GRAIL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When Burns White, 66, of Randolph, returned from the jazz festival, she was not immediately concerned. She’d been told that more often than not, a positive result from Galleri proves to be a false alarm. Her primary care doctor told her not to worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the result was pretty specific: It said cancer might be lurking in her breast, esophagus, and stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So Burns White consulted with doctors from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she works in community outreach and engagement. Two years ago, the hospital launched its &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/early-detection-interception" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Early Detection and Interception&lt;/a&gt;, which works with patients at high risk of cancer, those who receive troubling results from liquid biopsies, and others who learn of hard-to-interpret abnormalities from tests done for another purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White endured an endoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure involving threading a tube with a camera down her throat. The result was good news: no cancer of the esophagus or stomach. It would be a different story for breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A mammogram she had taken a few months before had detected masses — but they looked benign. The results of the GRAIL test “pushed us to look closer,” said O’Donnell, of Dana-Farber. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White underwent another set of mammograms, followed by MRIs and biopsies of both breasts. Doctors told her she had triple-negative breast cancer, a form that can be difficult to treat but that was still at an early stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Multicancer blood tests eventually will “change the face of early detection for cancer,” said Timothy R. Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But they still need more work because, while they catch some cancers at an early stage, others are missed, he said. And even a screening tool that saves lives can have costs: follow-up testing and sometimes needless treatment, as well as “the psychosocial costs of having to go through all of this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Recent preliminary &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/presentation/list?q=Galleri" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;results from the largest study of GRAIL’s Galleri test&lt;/a&gt; showed its promise and limitations. Galleri found many types of cancer for which there is no screening test, and 92 percent of the time it correctly identified where in the body the cancer originated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test was administered to 36,000 people aged 50 and older. Among the first 25,000 analyzed, Galleri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found a “cancer signal” in 216 cases — and cancer was confirmed in 133, about 60 percent. That compares favorably with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq#_80_toc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt;, said Megan P. Hall, vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL; she cited data showing that when a woman is called back for a follow-up mammogram, only 4 to 5 percent turn out to have cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were more false negatives than true positives — 196 people were told the test found no cancer but went on to develop it within the next year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, even though its purpose is early detection, nearly half the cancer cases the test found were already advanced. That’s because advanced cancers shed more DNA and are easier to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The endgame in early detection may come down to better defining who is most at risk and thus most likely to benefit from screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, pancreatic cancer is almost always detected at an advanced stage. But it’s so rare that it would make no sense to screen everybody. Researchers are looking for ways to identify a subset of high-risk people who would benefit from screening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/24/metro/ai-predict-pancreatic-cancer/?p1" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;deploying AI&lt;/a&gt; to comb through the medical records of millions of patients, looking for patterns common among those who went on to develop pancreatic cancers, such as changes in blood chemistry or more frequent doctor’s visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Dana-Farber, researchers have identified one possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer: muscle loss. By studying blood samples from people who developed pancreatic cancer going back years before their diagnosis, and also looking at CT scans, researchers led by Dr. Brian Wolpin and Dr. Michael H. Rosenthal found evidence that the pancreas starts to falter, performing its key functions less well, long before any tumor forms. This weakens the body’s ability to absorb proteins in the diet, causing it to break down muscle. But many factors can cause muscle loss, so further study is needed before these measures can be put to use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors are working on a warning system for lung cancer. An AI program called Sybil scanned thousands of chest X-rays of people who were later diagnosed with the disease and learned the patterns seen before someone develops cancer in the lung, said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director of the &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/cancer-early-detection" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“My vision for 25 years from now,” said Dana-Farber’s O’Donnell, “is that when you go to your primary care physician’s appointment, they say, ‘This is your risk score, and here are the screening tests you need.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who calls himself a “healthy skeptic” of cancer screening, would like to see the opposite: “If you want to lower the burden on patients,” he said, “develop the test that tells people they’re at low risk for cancer and [can] stop worrying about it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for Burns White, she’s happy with how the Galleri test played out for her. Once her breast cancer was diagnosed, she underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Today, a little over a year since her diagnosis, she continues to take a medication aimed at eradicating the remaining cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through it all, Burns White continued to work, taking off only a few days for the surgery. She expects her treatment to end in mid-December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I remain strong and optimistic,” she said, “and grateful to have had access to treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Instead of starting when joint pain becomes noticeable, the disease quietly builds over many years. RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that leads to inflammation and damage in the joints.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to new research, people who are at higher risk for RA undergo major changes in their immune system well before symptoms surface. Their bodies are already engaged in an unseen autoimmune struggle during this early, silent period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multi-Institution Study Maps RA's Hidden Early Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Allen Institute, CU Anschutz, University of California San Diego, and the Benaroya Research Institute worked together to uncover these early immune changes. Their findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, offer the most detailed view to date of how RA takes shape. By charting immune activity in individuals at risk, the team showed that the disease process is already underway long before joint problems are noticeable. These insights may help guide earlier intervention and possibly prevent disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, we hope this study raises awareness that rheumatoid arthritis begins much earlier than previously thought and that it enables researchers to make data-driven decisions on strategies to disrupt disease development," said Mark Gillespie, Ph.D., assistant investigator at the Allen Institute and co-senior author with Kevin Deane (CU Anschutz), M.D./Ph.D.; Adam Savage (Allen Institute), Ph.D.; Troy Torgerson (Allen Institute), M.D./Ph.D.; and Gary S. Firestein (UC San Diego), M.D. The research followed individuals with ACPA antibodies over seven years. These antibodies are well-established biomarkers for those at risk for RA. During the study, the team uncovered previously unrecognized contributors to disease progression, including widespread inflammation, immune system malfunction, and shifts in how certain immune cells function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward the findings from this study will support additional studies to identify ways to better predict who will get RA, identify potential biologic targets for preventing RA as well as identify ways to improve treatments for those with existing RA," said Kevin Deane, M.D./Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; The researchers observed that people at risk for RA already showed signs of systemic inflammation throughout the body. This inflammation was not limited to the joints. Instead, it resembled the body-wide inflammatory pattern commonly seen in individuals with active RA.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cell dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple immune cell types showed unusual behavior.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which normally create protective antibodies, were found in a heightened pro-inflammatory state.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T helper cells&lt;/strong&gt;, especially those similar to Tfh17 cells, had expanded far beyond typical levels. These cells help coordinate immune responses, including the creation of autoantibodies (antibodies that attack the body's own tissues). Their expansion helps explain why the immune system begins targeting healthy tissue.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most striking discoveries was that even "naive" T cells, which have not yet encountered pathogens, showed epigenetic changes. Although their DNA sequence remained intact, the regulation of their genes had shifted. This altered gene activity suggests these cells were being reprogrammed before encountering any threats.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint-like inflammation detected in blood:&lt;/strong&gt; The team also found that monocytes (a type of white blood cell) circulating in the bloodstream were producing high amounts of inflammatory molecules. Remarkably, these cells closely resembled the macrophages typically found in the inflamed joints of RA patients, indicating that the immune system was already setting the stage for joint inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Early Detection and Preventive Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight new early-warning indicators (biomarkers and immune signatures) that could help doctors determine which at-risk individuals are most likely to develop RA. Identifying the disease during this hidden phase may make it possible to monitor patients more closely and begin treatment earlier. If this process is caught in time, RA may be prevented before joint damage begins -- potentially sparing patients years of pain and disability. The research supports a shift from reacting to joint damage after it appears to preventing RA at its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that, in 28 days, people in the urolithin A group had changes in biomarkers associated with age-related immune decline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A leads to better cell function, but it also has a positive impact on muscle,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://georg-speyer-haus.de/en/forschung/forschungsgruppen/prof-dr-florian-greten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florian Greten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florian Greten&lt;/a&gt;, MD, researcher and director of the Georg-Speyer-Haus Institut für Tumorbiologie. (Separate early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests urolithin A has the potential to enhance muscle health and performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greten says it’s “exciting” that he and other researchers were able to detect these positive changes within a month. “We don’t know yet if you can take a lower amount and get a similar impact, but we are studying that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urolithin A is a bioactive compound that’s produced in the gut when certain compounds (mostly ellagitannins and ellagic acid) are broken down by specific gut bacteria, explains Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: Not everyone produces urolithin A efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that only about 40 percent of people have the right gut microbiome for this,” Dr. Greten says. If you don’t have the "right" microbiome, meaning you're missing certain necessary bacteria, your gut won’t produce this compound efficiently through foods, he says, adding that there’s no publicly available test to see if you have these bacteria or not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, urolithin A supplements can theoretically work despite missing certain bacteria since it doesn't need to be converted, Dr. Greten says. Remember: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement, including urolithin A, especially if you have preexisting medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Dr. Greten's study, here’s some additional preliminary research swirling around urolithin A. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Early research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Early research&lt;/a&gt; indicates urolithin A may support healthy aging by enhancing how your cells produce and recycle energy,” says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Some small human &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest it could improve muscle endurance and aspects of immune function, but the research is still preliminary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research surrounding urolithin A involves supplements, but certain foods may spark a process in your body that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; urolithin A. “It’s not found in large amounts in food, but your body creates it after you eat foods that are rich in these precursor compounds,” Cording says.

For heterogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1 and NPPO-5, organoid culture medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of homogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1NE, NPPO-2, NPPO-4 and NPPO-6, we used neuroendocrine organoid culture medium, which was identical to the organoid culture medium except that no EGF was added; the medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of non-neuroendocrine NPPO organoids (NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO8 and NPPO9), we used the standard organoid culture medium. In organoid experiments involving CRISPR–Cas9-mediated targeting of &lt;i&gt;Nsd2&lt;/i&gt;, oncohistone H3.3K36M expression or NSD2i treatment, DHT was removed from the culture medium starting at day 0, and organoids were maintained in the absence of DHT for subsequent analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For passaging, organoids were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min, followed by the addition of 1 ml pre-warmed TrypLE for 10 min at 37 °C for cell dissociation. After neutralization with 10 ml PBS, cells were spun down and counted, with approximately 50,000 cells plated per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates (Corning, 3474). To generate cryopreserved stocks, organoids were frozen in 90% CS-FBS and 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. We considered neuroendocrine organoid lines to be successfully established when they could be stably passaged, cryopreserved and recovered without loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes.

The collagen button was then put into a biopsy cassette (Fisher Scientific, 15182705E) and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. After replacing the formalin with 70% ethanol, the cassettes were put into an automated tissue processor for tissue processing and embedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned into 5-µm sections using a microtome and dried onto microscope slides at room temperature. Paraffin sections were baked at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization with 3 changes of xylene (5 min each). The slides were hydrated through 100%, 95% and 95% ethanol, 5 min each, rinsed in tap water for 2 min and incubated in Gill Hematoxylin 3 (Epredia, 72611) for 3–30 min. Slides were rinsed in tap water and dipped 3–5 times in 0.5% acid alcohol (Leica Biosystems, 3803651), followed by rinsing in tap water and bluing with Scott’s Tap Water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 2607007) for 5 min. After rinsing in tap water, slides were incubated in 95% ethanol for 5 min and counterstained with eosin (StatLab, S1761GL) for 1–3 min. Slides were passed through 70%, 95% and 100% (3 times) ethanol, rinsed 3 times in xylene and coverslipped with mounting medium (StatLab, MMC0126). Images were captured using an Olympus BX 61 VS slide scanner, and image acquisition was performed using Olympus VS-ASW (v.2.5) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin sections (5 µm) were dried onto microscope slides at room temperature, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization through 3 changes of xylene (5 min each), hydrated in 100%, 95%, 95% and 75% ethanol (5 min each) and washed in tap water for 2 min. Antigen retrieval was performed through immersion in boiling citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min, cooling to room temperature for 30 min and incubation in Milli-Q water at room temperature for 10 min. Sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (MilliporeSigma, 11332481001) for 10 min and blocked in 10% goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50062Z) for 1 h. Primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) were added to sections and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific D1306) for 5 min. Slides were washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield Antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories H-1200-10). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF v.2.6.0) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;scRNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scRNA-seq, NPPO-1, NPPO-2, NPPO-4, NPPO-5 and NPPO-6 organoids were analysed at passage 2. Organoids were dissociated by incubation with pre-warmed TrypLE at 37 °C for 10 min, neutralization with 1:10 5% CS-FBS–PBS, centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and filtration 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning 431750). Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, pellets were dissociated with 5% CS-FBS–PBS and resuspended at 1,000 cells per µl after counting using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Libraries were prepared using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent kit (v3.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Approximately 5,000 cells were loaded onto a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) to generate gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), and barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA was generated and amplified by PCR. Chromium Gene Expression libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and scRNA-seq data were processed using Cell Ranger software (10x Genomics, v.2.1.1 for MJ002 and MJ004; v.3.0.2 for MJ005, MJ007, MJ008 and MJ012; v.5.0.1 for MJ014 and MJ015; see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM7"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core.

Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec 130-091-376) were used for single nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml chilled wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in a Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS and 0.1% Tween-20 in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1% BAS in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Approximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium Controller at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-nucleus ATAC–seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v.1.1, 10X Genomics). In brief, nuclei were transposed and partitioned into GEMs. 10x barcodes were added to index the transposed DNA of each individual nucleus. Libraries were generated by PCR and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Paired-end sequencing data were processed with Cell Ranger ATAC (v.1.0.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core.

The cells were filtered 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning, 431750), spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended with PBS and 2% CS-FBS. After filtering through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm strainer cap (Corning 352235), cell numbers were counted in a TC20 automated cell counter, and the volume was adjusted to a final cell concentration of 5,000 cells per µl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow sorting was performed on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124) at the Flow Cytometry Core of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. Gating by forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) was used to exclude debris, and doublets were excluded by gating on trigger pulse width against FSC height. Individual neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells were sorted based on scatter parameters. Neuroendocrine tumour cells have less internal complexity (granularity) than non-neuroendocrine tumour cells and exhibit lower intensity SSC. Flow sorting data were collected and analysed using BD FACS software (BD Biosciences, v.1.2.0.142). Cell purity was assessed after flow sorting by scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Lineage tracing in organoids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow-sorted neuroendocrine cells from NPPO-1 organoids were maintained in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel. Half of the flow-sorted non-neuroendocrine cells were used for scRNA-seq (Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core) immediately after sorting. The other non-neuroendocrine cells were transfected with H2B-RFP (Addgene, 26001) lentivirus. Approximately 70% of non-neuroendocrine cells were labelled with H2B-RFP at 3 days after transfection, in the absence of antibiotic selection. On day 7, the cells were digested with TrypLE and passed 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer to ensure a single-cell suspension, followed by cell counting. For co-culture, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded together with neuroendocrine cells at a ratio of 2:3 in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates; as a control, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded alone. The resulting organoids were cultured in organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel and analysed at passage 4 by immunostaining and scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Imaging of histone and DNA modifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To screen for differential expression of histone modifications between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells in NPPO-1 organoids, we performed immunofluorescence staining with antibodies that detect the neuroendocrine markers SYP or CHGA, the non-neuroendocrine marker VIM, and various histone and DNA modifications (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were acquired using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (LAS AF v.2.6.0). Fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ (NIH; v.1.52K) using three parameters: area, integrated density (IntDen) and mean grey value. The background was measured from a region that had no fluorescence on the same image. Intensity was calculated using the formula: Intensity = IntDen – (area &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\times \)&lt;/span&gt; mean fluorescence of background readings). Measurements were collected from three independent organoids, and results were plotted using Prism 9 (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used to compare means, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated from two-tailed &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Analysis of &lt;i&gt;NSD2&lt;/i&gt; expression in human datasets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate differences in gene expression of &lt;i&gt;NSD1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; NSD2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NSD3&lt;/i&gt; in human prostate tumour samples, we analysed bulk RNA-seq from 49 patients with CRPC (15 CRPC-NE and 34 CRPC-Adeno) from a published dataset&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Beltran, H. et al.

In brief, cells were lysed in 1 ml TRI reagent per 5 million cells and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The homogenate was mixed with 0.1 volume 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (MilliporeSigma, B9673), incubated at room temperature for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Next, 100 μl of the aqueous phase was transferred to an 8-strip EpiCypher tube (DNase/RNase-free), and 50 μl of 100% isopropanol (MilliporeSigma I9516) was added with shaking for 1 min. Next, 10 μl RNA binding beads was added, followed by shaking for 3 min. The RNA binding beads were then captured on a magnetic stand and the beads were washed twice with 150 μl wash solution. The beads were dried for 2 min, and RNA was eluted in 50 μl elution buffer. All samples were DNase-treated before library construction. Quality assessment was performed using a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent), with a median RNA integrity number of 9.2 (range of 8.7–9.8). Libraries were generated using the Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep, and 150-bp paired-end sequencing was performed to a minimum of 20 million reads per sample on an Illumina HiSeq platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;CUT&amp;amp;Tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before cell preparation, 10 µl per sample concanavalin A (ConA)-coated magnetic beads (Bangs Laboratories BP531) was transferred into a 1.5-ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf 022431021) and mixed by gentle vortexing with 0.4 ml binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15630080), 10 mM KCl (MilliporeSigma, 60142), 1 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MilliporeSigma, 21115) and 1 mM MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MilliporeSigma M1787) in nuclease-free water). The tubes were placed on a magnetic stand (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12321D) to clear and remove liquid, with the wash repeated once with binding buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments requiring normalization of input DNA, 10,000 &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Schneider 2 (S2) cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R69007) were combined with 200,000 experimental cells at a ratio of 1:20. S2 cells were maintained in Schneider’s &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21720024), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini, 100-106) and 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; primocin. S2 cells were plated in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates at a seeding density of approximately 100,000 cells per well and maintained at 28 °C without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, counted using a TC20 automated cell counter, and 200,000 cells per sample were used for profiling. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at room temperature, cell pellets were washed once with 1 ml wash buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine (MilliporeSigma, S2501) and cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma, 11873580001) in nuclease-free water). Cell pellets were resuspended with 10 µl ConA beads in 0.4 ml wash buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The tubes were then placed on a magnetic stand (New England Biolabs, S1515S) to clear and remove the liquid, with pellets resuspended with 50 µl ice-cold Dig-wash buffer (wash buffer with 0.05% digitonin) and placed on ice for 10 min to lyse the cells. The samples were then transferred to an 8-strip tube (EpiCypher, 10-0009). Each sample was incubated with 0.5 µg primary or IgG control antibody (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM10"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) and placed on a nutator at 4 °C overnight. The next day, samples were incubated with 1 µl secondary antibody in 50 µl ice-cold Dig-wash buffer on a nutator at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with Dig-Wash buffer 3 times, beads were resuspended with 50 µl Dig-300 buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.01% digitonin, cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail in nuclease-free water) containing 2.5 µl pA-Tn5 adapter complex (EpiCypher, 15-1017) and placed on a nutator at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 3 times with Dig-300 buffer, the beads were resuspended in 150 µl Tagmentation buffer (Dig-300 buffer with 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stop tagmentation and to solubilize DNA fragments, 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9260G), 1.5 µl 10% SDS (MilliporeSigma, 71736) and 1.25 µl 20 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0491) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The next day, phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15593049) was used to extract nucleic acids. DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol (MilliporeSigma, E7023) and dissolved in 25 μl RNase-free water. To remove RNA contamination before library preparation, DNA samples were incubated with 25 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) at 37 °C for 10 min. Library DNAs were amplified by PCR using Illumina universal i5 primers, Nextera barcoded i7 primers (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM12"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) and NEBNext HiFi 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs, M0541). The PCR conditions were as follows: cycle 1: 72 °C for 5 min; cycle 2: 98 °C for 30 s; cycle 3: 98 °C for 10 s; cycle 4: 63 °C for 10 s, repeating 14 times, followed by 72 °C for 1 min and hold at 8 °C. Post-PCR clean-up was performed using 1:1 volume Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880). Samples were dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8; MilliporeSigma, T2694) for sequencing. Size distribution and concentration of libraries were determined by capillary electrophoresis using a 4200 TapeStation (Agilent). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed on pooled libraries, with 10–12 million reads per library, using an Illumina HiSeq system.

Scaling factors for spike-in normalization were determined by the ratio between the number of reads aligned to the mouse genome and the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genome. Potential PCR duplicates were removed by the markdup function of sambamba (v.1.0.1). Peak calling was performed using SEACR (v.1.3) or MACS2 (v.2.2.8) with IgG input as control. Intersect function of bedtools (v.2.27.1) was used to identify H3K27ac enhancers corresponding to H3K27ac peaks not overlapping promoters and found in broader H3K36me2 domains. Motif analysis was performed using the simple enrichment analysis function from MEME suit (v.5.5.7) with the JASPAR 2022 Core motif database&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Rauluseviciute, I. et al.

Heatmap and enrichment plots of H3K36me2, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 or H3K27ac over H3K36me2 or H3K27ac peaks were generated using the computeMatrix (reference- point, - a 5000 - b 5000) and plotHeatmap functions implemented in DeepTools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-seq reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT2 (v.2.1.0). The mapped reads count of each gene was measured by featureCounts (v.1.6.1). The RNA-seq read count matrix was combined with the CUT&amp;amp;Tag signal read count matrix for all gene loci in R (v.4.1.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Lentivirus production and transfection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentiviruses were generated by the transfection of 293T cells with the indicated expression plasmid and the psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pVSV.G (Addgene, 14888) packaging vectors at a ratio of 4:2:3, respectively. Viral supernatants were collected at 48, 72 and 96 h after transfection, filtered and concentrated using a Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232). For CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout, we used the lentiCas9-blast plasmid (Addgene, 52962) and a custom vector for sgRNA (U6-sgRNA-EFS-Puro-P2A-TurboRFP in a pLL3-based lentiviral backbone; gift from S. Lowe). For sgRNA design, the CRISPick platform (BROAD institute) was used. HA-tagged H3.3K36M was overexpressed in the pCDH vector (gift from D. Allis). The following sgRNAs were used in the experiment: sgControl, 5′ GAG ATA AGC ATT ATA ATT CCT 3′; sgNsd2 (mouse): 5′ TCA GGG TCT CAC AAT TGG GC 3′; sgNSD2 (human): 5′ GCA CCA GCT CAC GTT GAC GT 3′.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transfection, organoids were incubated with high-titre lentivirus in culture medium supplemented with 8 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene (MilliporeSigma, TR-1003). Medium containing virus was removed on the next day and switched to normal organoid medium with Matrigel. Selection with appropriate antibiotics was performed at 3 days after transfection for 7–14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Multiplexed staining of TMAs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary antibodies were tested on prostate tumour samples to verify the expected pattern of staining and were titrated at four concentrations to determine the best signal-to-noise ratio. Multiplexed staining was performed using an Opal 6-plex detection kit (Akoya Biosciences, NEL871001KT) on a Bond Rx Research Stainer (Leica Biosystems), adding DAPI as a nuclear marker. Slides were imaged using a Vectra Polaris Automated Quantitative Pathology Multispectral Imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). Exposure times were optimized under the constraint that no pixel saturated the detector. These studies were conducted under protocols approved by Weill Cornell Medical Center. All patients with prostate cancer or their families provided informed consent for research use of biospecimens and clinical data under an institutional approved protocol (IRB #1008011210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Analysis of patient survival curves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the association of NSD2 with overall survival in mCRPC, two independent mCRPC biopsy RNA-seq cohorts were used: (1) a cohort of 159 mCRPC transcriptomes generated by the PCF–SU2C Prostate Cancer Dream Team&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Abida, W. et al.

Tissue segmentation of the images was performed using a deep-learning classifier by training the algorithm ‘DenseNet V2’ from the Halo AI plug-in (Indica Labs, v.3.6), using only the DAPI channel as information for the training. Eight different classes were defined for both tissue segmentation and quality control issues: background, stroma, malignant tumour, benign glands, necrosis, liver tissue, decalcified tissue and out-of-focus regions. The performance of the classifier was evaluated by a pathologist (F.S.) to ensure that the majority of tissue compartments were properly classified. Cell segmentation was performed using a pre-trained deep-learning model already present in Halo AI (‘nuclei seg’) and applied to the DAPI channel only. Using the module ‘analysis’ in the Halo software, all the biomarkers were then quantified using the segmentation algorithms to generate a counts matrix representing the average expression of each marker in each cell. Thresholding for each marker was performed using a Gaussian mixture model of statistically robust cut-off values for low versus high intensity of the markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for the precise nuclei or cytoplasmic marker locations from the immunofluorescence intensities were mapped for each TMA core. The coordinate point location was taken for multiple-localization analysis in different classes of markers. There are M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; classes of markers, for which each class is composed of a different combination of markers. For any given combination of markers, M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; (each composed of nuclei or cytoplasm as detected with thresholds on their intensities), we classified a given nucleus or cytoplasm NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; coordinate, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; in [1, …,&lt;i&gt; i&lt;/i&gt;], belonging to M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; class. We repeated this process for each NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; in M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; to form a distribution of multiple localizations in the different classes of markers, C&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. Measures for C&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; were recorded for each TMA core sample and normalized using the total number of NC&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; belonging to M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; class per patient. For any given marker, M1, …, M&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, we also measured the overall distribution at the single-localization level. The mean value for the measures was implemented by Welch ANOVA or unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (two-tailed) in Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Flow sorting of transfected cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout experiments, organoids were transfected with the lentiCas9-blast plasmid and blasticidin selection to establish stable lines. A custom vector for the sgRNA lentivirus carrying a TurboRFP reporter and puromycin antibiotic was then transfected into the Cas9-expressing organoids. After 14 days of antibiotic selection, we performed FACS on the PE channel to sort RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124), as described above. Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) for single-nucleus isolation and multiome ATAC–seq (10x Genomics). Additional collected RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were used for organoid culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments in which mouse neuroendocrine tumour organoids were transfected with an HA-tagged H3.3K36M lentiviral vector, we performed flow cytometry at 14 days after antibiotic selection to determine the purity of the culture. Organoids were dissociated into single cells and resuspended in 100 µl 4% paraformaldehyde (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells) to fix for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were neutralized with 1 ml PBS, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS. The cells were permeabilized for 10 min by the addition of 0.5 ml 1% Triton-X100 with gentle vortexing to a final concentration of 0.5% Triton-X100. Cells were washed in 10 ml PBS and resuspended with 100 µl Cy5.5-conjugated mouse anti-HA-Tag antibody (clone 6E2, Cell Signaling Technology, 62145) diluted 1:50 in 0.5% BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated with antibody for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, washed twice in 0.5% BSA, resuspended in 300 µl 0.5% BSA and filtered through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm cell strainer cap. Flow cytometry was performed on the APC channel using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) as described above, using Cy5.5&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; events to determine the percentage of HA-Tag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Flow data were analysed using FlowJo (BD, v.10.8.2). The same batch of cells was collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS for single-nucleus isolation and multiome single-nucleus ATAC–seq and snRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Single-nucleus multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids were digested into single cells using TrypLE, passed through a 40-µm cell strainer 3 times, and cell numbers were quantified using an automated cell counter. Approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) were used for single-nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in the Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT (MilliporeSigma, 646563) and 1 U µl&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor (MilliporeSigma, 3335399001) in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1 mM DTT, 1 U µl&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL Automated cell counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium X Controller (10x Genomics) at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome Reagent kit, 10x Genomics). In brief, nucleus suspensions were transposed and adapters added to the ends of the DNA fragments. Single Cell Multiome ATAC + GEX Gel Beads include a poly(dT) sequence that enables production of barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA for the gene expression (GEX) library and a spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for the ATAC library. The GEMs were generated by combining barcoded gel beads, transposed nuclei and a master mix. Barcoded transposed DNA and barcoded full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA were amplified by PCR. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and data were processed using Cell Ranger ARC (10x Genomics, v.1.0.0 for MJ018, MJ019, MJ020, MJ021, MJ022 and MJ023; v.2.0.2 for MJ024 and MJ025; see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09727-z#MOESM7"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core.

Cells were resuspended in 5% Matrigel in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium lacking DHT and plated in triplicate at a seeding density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates. The next day, 7 doses of enzalutamide in 0.1% DMSO were dispensed at 1.5-fold dilution from 1 µM to 11.25 µM. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega G9683), and luminescence was measured using a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Background luminescence was measured in medium without cells. The percentage of viable cells was calculated using the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\rm{V}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}\,{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{s}}\,({\rm{ \% }})=\frac{{\rm{E}}{\rm{x}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}\,{\rm{v}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{e}}-{\rm{b}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{k}}{\rm{g}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{d}}\,{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{g}}}{{\rm{V}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{h}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}\,{\rm{v}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{e}}-{\rm{b}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{k}}{\rm{g}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{d}}\,{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{g}}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug–response curves were generated by nonlinear regression using the percentage of viable cells against the logarithm of drug concentrations using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were calculated by the equation log (inhibitor) versus response (variable slope, four parameters). Two-way ANOVA was used to compare dose–response curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar methods were used to determine response of mouse or human organoids to defined doses of enzalutamide, using 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human). The percentage of viable cells from different treatment groups were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used to compare means between two groups.

A 10 μl reaction system was assembled with 25 nM lysine methyltransferase enzyme (or enzyme complex), 0.5 µM SAM, 100 nM mononucleosome (EpiCypher), MTase-Glo reagent (1×) and a series of diluted NSD2i in reaction buffer (containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10% glycerol) in a white 384-well microplate (Corning). NSD2i was serially diluted from 30 μM to 0 μM in threefold concentrations. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C.

Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well (mouse) in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium without DHT in a 96-well low-attachment dish with 5% Matrigel (mouse) or as a total of 25,000 cells (human) in a 50 µl 80% Matrigel button in human neuroendocrine culture medium without DHT. DMSO or NSD2i at concentrations ranging from 0.3 µM to 10 µM were added on the day of plating and replenished every other day. Following pretreatment, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. The next day, DMSO or the same concentration of NSD2i were dispensed together with enzalutamide at threefold dilutions ranging from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega, G9683), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To detect apoptotic cell death, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. DMSO (negative control), 10 µM bortezomib (Cayman Chemical, 10008822) as a positive control or NSD2i was dispensed together with a threefold dilution series of enzalutamide from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Apoptotic cell death was assayed after 24–48 h treatment using a Caspase-Glo(R) 3/7 3D assay (Promega, G8981), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Luminescence values were first normalized to the DMSO-treated controls and then compared with 10 µM bortezomib treatment, which induces 100% apoptotic cell death after 24 or 48 h. The resulting signals normalized to a percentage of maximal response were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate epigenomic changes after drug treatment, non-neuroendocrine NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO-8 and NPPO-9 organoids were seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. On the day after seeding, DMSO, 1 µM enzalutamide or the combination of 1 µM enzalutamide and 1 µM NSD2i was added into the culture medium and replenished every other day. On day 40 after treatment, organoids were collected for fixation by 10% formalin for immunofluorescence staining or for flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen for western blot analysis.

The organoids were then dissociated and seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. One day after seeding, 100 nM DHT or DMSO was added to the medium and replenished every other day.

NOD/SCID mice underwent surgical castration at 7 days before grafting. For mouse grafts, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; dissociated organoid cells in 100 µl hepatocyte culture medium and 5% Matrigel were subcutaneously injected into the flank using a 1 ml syringe with a 25 G needle (BD, 305122). For human grafts, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; dissociated cells in 100 µl 60% Matrigel and 40% hepatocyte culture medium were injected. Tumour sizes were measured with a digital caliper.

Cells with &amp;gt;1,000 detected genes and 1,000 unique molecular identificer (UMI) counts were retained, whereas cells with &amp;gt;10,000 detected genes or 50,000 UMI counts and with &amp;gt;20% of mitochondrial gene content were discarded. For doublet detection and removal, we used the Scrublet (v.0.2.2) algorithm as implemented in scanpy, applied to each sample independently. Each sample was then subsampled by retaining 3,000 cells that passed quality control, using the ‘subsample’ function with random state set to 666 as implemented in scanpy. All samples processed with the same technology (that is, single-cell or single-nuclei) were merged and UMI counts per cell were converted to sum to 1e4 and log-normalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Reverse engineering of prostate organoid regulatory networks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each scRNA-seq sample, a shared neighbours graph was built with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nn &lt;/sub&gt;= 15 to select cells with the most similar transcriptional profiles and to merge them to generate high-resolution ensembles of cells (metacells). This approach augments the number of detected genes per cell, which usually is very low owing to technological dropout bias (&amp;lt;20%), thus increasing the number of targets that can be recovered by reverse engineering of regulatory networks. Metacell profiles were computed on normalized data, merged into UMI counts, and transformed to CPM for downstream analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sample-specific regulatory network (interactome) was reverse engineered from the resulting metacell CPM profiles (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 500) using ARACNe-AP&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Lachmann, A., Giorgi, F.
