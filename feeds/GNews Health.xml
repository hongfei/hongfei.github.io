    &lt;p&gt;Ameilia Boodoosingh Gopie didn't expect the deep depression after the birth of her first daughter in August 2022. In the months that followed, Gopie struggled to get out of bed and couldn't spend time with her daughter. Her husband was essentially "a single dad for eight months," she said. Routine appointments fell by the wayside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly a year, Gopie finally began to feel better. She was determined to make up for lost time. She took her daughter to visit family in New York, Canada and Trinidad. Soon, her daughter was walking and talking. Gopie was so distracted by "getting to love on my baby" that she continued skipping regular appointments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Gopie realized that a cut she had given herself while shaving had become infected. Her primary care physician reminded her of the importance of annual appointments, especially her mammogram. She said her &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dense-breast-tissue-mammogram/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;dense breasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; qualified her for earlier screenings. After their conversation, Gopie made an appointment. The results of her mammogram were abnormal, so her doctor ran another test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, she received the results: She had Stage III breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Just saying that C-word ripped me and my husband to pieces," Gopie, now 42, said. "I remember us both crying like two-year-olds. And my husband's holding my daughter. My daughter's like, 'It's OK, Dada. It's OK, Mama.' She didn't know any better, she was just trying to make her parents stop crying." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coping with aggressive treatment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gopie and her family celebrated that Christmas as normally as possible. On December 26, she said they "hit the ground running" to get a second opinion and figure out a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing determined that Gopie had triple-positive breast cancer. The subtype affects about 10% of breast cancer patients, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/triple-positive-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It has hormone receptors that make it more likely to respond favorably to treatment, but tends to be aggressive and present at a later stage, said Dr. Stuart Samuels, a radiation oncologist at the University of Miami Health System's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center who treated Gopie. The disease had also spread to Gopie's lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommended aggressive treatment beginning with chemotherapy. It had uncomfortable side effects, including pain, nausea and vomiting, Gopie said. Eventually, she lost her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Gopie said it was hard to spend time with her daughter or stay focused at work. Gopie did what she could, prioritizing family time. When she was too sick to be with her daughter, she wrote letters to her and planned activities for when she was feeling better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"As a mom, you just keep jumping through another hoop, and you're like, 'It's OK, as long as she's good,'" Gopie said. "You just keep going." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video diary, recorded before each treatment session, became a surprising source of strength, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would tell that video how I felt, if I was happy, if I was sad, if I was nervous, what I think I'm going to expect that day, what I think I want for that day. I prayed every day and I still pray, but talking to myself every time before chemo helped a lot," Gopie said. "I realized doing those videos helped me to just release my feelings at that time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"It gets overwhelming" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing chemotherapy, Gopie underwent a double mastectomy. Samuels said surgeons found "quite a bit of cancer left in the breast," as well as in her armpit. That meant she would need radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels administered the treatment over the next three weeks. Gopie said the radiation had new side effects, including intense headaches and a burning feeling in her skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later tests showed she would need more chemotherapy. The treatment was exhausting, Gopie said, and made it hard for her to work and spend time with her family. Most of her focus went to just putting one foot in front of the other, she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gopie is still "in a limbo area," Samuels said, but "the hardest part is over." When Gopie spoke to CBS News, she was still undergoing radiation, taking a daily medication and receiving a regular hormone therapy infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She still has an aggressive cancer, but she's just living her life," Samuels said. "Now it's really about recovery and enjoying her daughter." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Learning to be the new Ameilia"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gopie said she has been working on finding a new normal. She recently had reconstructive surgery and said she is beginning to feel more like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting, you know, the life that I live. I'm trying to maintain the old Ameilia, but now to go through the new journey that I'm going through, I'm also learning to be the new Ameilia, who goes through pains and nausea and wakes up with huge headaches and has a three-year-old," Gopie said. "It gets overwhelming." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, the depression that haunted Gopie early in her daughter's life has never returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank goodness, I haven't gone through that," Gopie said. "I try my best to enjoy life. I know I'm going to be fine. I want to enjoy every second with my baby. I want to sing with her and laugh at her and dance with her and write things to her and leave it all over the house. I keep it positive."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the ways scientists are trying to improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-breast-cancer-pill-extends-survival-in-7-year-trial"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; is by better equipping &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;the body's own immune system&lt;/a&gt; to fight off the disease – and a new study identifies a molecular switch that can do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through an extensive screening process in which genes in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187392" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells in the lab were 'switched off' to pinpoint their effects, researchers found that a gene producing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2014.123"&gt;the TAK1 protein&lt;/a&gt; was crucial for cancer cells to evade immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in mice with normal immune systems then confirmed how vital TAK1 is for cancer: Tumors in mice without this protein grew more slowly, and the mice survived for longer, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-anti-cancer-drug-discovered-inside-japanese-tree-frog"&gt;Powerful Anti-Cancer Drug Discovered Inside Japanese Tree Frog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team from institutions in Australia and Ireland believes their findings could aid in the development of future treatments. Medications could potentially directly target TAK1 production, and 'flip' this molecular switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187395" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect.jpg" alt="TAK1 protein effect" class="wp-image-187395 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect-600x557.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187395" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how the TAK1 protein affected cancer cells. (Djajawi et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is known that TAK1 promotes cancer cell survival and blocks cell death," &lt;a href="https://www.onjcri.org.au/news/research/onjcri-researchers-discover-molecular-safety-switch-shielding-cancers-from-immune-attack/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cancer cell biologist Anne Huber, from the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (ONJCRI) in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we didn't know that cancer cells use this tactic to avoid killing by the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huber and colleagues examined in greater detail the mechanisms underlying TAK1's effect. Specifically, it protects cancer cells from the activity of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"&gt;CD8⁺ T cells&lt;/a&gt;, immune cells that clear out damaged cells and kill deadly invaders like cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way these CD8⁺ T cells are effective is by releasing chemical signals called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cytokines&lt;/a&gt;, which can more readily reach their targets when TAK1 is absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how this process works in detail could help scientists better harness it for cancer treatments. When TAK1 is removed, cancer cells are essentially trying to survive without one of their best bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180218" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-642x642.avif" alt="cartoon illustrating immune cells as characters " class="size-medium wp-image-180218" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-642x642.avif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-675x675.avif 675w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-768x768.avif 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-600x600.avif 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2.avif 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180218" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;CD8+ cells and natural killer (NK) cells both play a role in killing deadly pathogens.

There's reason to believe the results can translate to humans, but that work still needs to be carried out and extended to a broader range of cancers (this study looked mainly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-may-protect-people-from-skin-cancer-but-at-a-terrible-cost"&gt;at melanoma&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these findings are encouraging. One of the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosted-natural-killer-cells-could-lead-to-off-the-shelf-cancer-immunotherapy"&gt;immunotherapy approaches&lt;/a&gt; to tackle tumors is that they lean more heavily on the body's own defences, rather than chemotherapy drugs or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient safety is always a crucial consideration whenever it comes to cancer-fighting treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping the production of TAK1 may be feasible in the future, but investigators will need to determine potential adverse health effects on the rest of the body and weigh them against the benefits.&lt;br&gt;

The research shows that time-restricted eating does not lead to measurable improvements in metabolic or cardiovascular health when calorie intake remains unchanged. However, the timing of meals did affect the body's internal clocks. These findings come from the ChronoFast study led by Prof. Olga Ramich and were published in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that limits daily food intake to a window of no more than ten hours, followed by a fasting period of at least 14 hours. The approach has become popular as a simple strategy to support weight management and metabolic health. Animal studies show that TRE can protect rodents from diet-related obesity and metabolic problems. In humans, earlier studies have reported benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity, healthier blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and modest reductions in body weight and body fat. As a result, TRE has been widely viewed as a promising tool for preventing insulin resistance and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting Evidence From Earlier Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its popularity, past research on TRE has produced mixed results. Many studies have not been able to determine whether observed health improvements came from shorter eating windows, unintentional calorie reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, most earlier trials did not carefully track calorie intake or control for other factors that could influence metabolic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, Prof. Olga Ramich, Head of the Department of Molecular Metabolism and Precision Nutrition at the DIfE and Professor at the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, designed the ChronoFast trial. The goal was to test whether an eight-hour eating window could improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic markers when calorie intake was kept constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the ChronoFast Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study used a randomized crossover design and included 31 women with overweight or obesity. Each participant followed two different eating schedules for two weeks at a time. One schedule involved early time-restricted eating between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.(eTRE). The other followed a later schedule from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. (lTRE). Throughout both phases, participants ate nearly identical meals with the same calorie and nutrient content (isocaloric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected blood samples during four clinic visits and performed oral glucose tolerance tests to assess glucose and fat metabolism. Continuous glucose monitoring tracked blood sugar levels over 24 hours while food intake was recorded in detail. Physical activity was monitored using a motion sensor. In collaboration with Prof. Achim Kramer from the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the team also examined changes in the body's internal clock using isolated blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the Body's Internal Clock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human biology follows internally generated rhythms that roughly align with the length of a day, which is why they are known as circadian clocks (Latin: circa and dia). These rhythms help regulate nearly every physiological process, including sleep and metabolism. Almost all cells in the body contain their own internal clock, which can be influenced by light, physical activity, and food timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure individual circadian phases, Prof. Dr. Achim Kramer developed the BodyTime assay. This test requires only a single blood sample and provides an objective snapshot of a person's internal timing. The ChronoFast study used this method and confirmed that eating schedules can shift internal clocks in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Metabolic Improvements Found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite expectations based on earlier research, the ChronoFast study found no clinically meaningful changes in insulin sensitivity, blood sugar, blood fats, or inflammatory markers after the two-week interventions. "Our results suggest that the health benefits observed in earlier studies were likely due to unintended calorie reduction, rather than the shortened eating period itself," explains Ramich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While metabolic measures remained largely unchanged, the timing of meals did affect circadian rhythms. Analysis of blood cells showed that the internal clock shifted by an average of 40 minutes during the late eating schedule compared to the early schedule. Participants following the later eating window also went to bed and woke up later. "The timing of food intake acts as a cue for our biological rhythms -- similar to light," says first author Beeke Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories and Individual Timing May Matter Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the importance of calorie balance in achieving health benefits from intermittent fasting. "Those who want to lose weight or improve their metabolism should pay attention not only to the clock, but also to their energy balance," Ramich concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to explore whether combining time-restricted eating with reduced calorie intake produces stronger benefits. Scientists also aim to better understand how individual factors, including chronotype and genetics, may influence how people respond to different eating schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-eats-high-protein-diet-without-ultra-processed-foods-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, a registered nutritionist based in the UK, found out his cholesterol levels were "really high" in June, he decided to manage them through diet, focusing particularly on increasing his fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, when he tested again, his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chickpea-recipes-to-lower-cholesterol-science-backed-advice-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; had improved, and he'd discovered four tricks that make eating more fiber easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance the body needs for many bodily processes, but if a person has too much LDL or "bad" cholesterol, it can form sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cholesterol levels, the American Heart Association recommends exercising at least 150 minutes a week, quitting smoking and vaping, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a heart-healthy diet that's low in saturated fats and high in fiber. If these measures don't help, then statins, a medication that lowers LDL cholesterol, will likely be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson, the author of "Unprocess Your Life" and "The Low Appetite Cookbook," already worked out for around an hour each morning, and ate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;minimal ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fats. So he zeroed in on fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;Eating at least 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day can help lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, according to the National Lipid Association. Quinoa, oats, avocado, sweet potatoes, carrots, and chia or flax seeds are good examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Hobson's tips for seamlessly adding more fiber to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530" data-toc-id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson is a big advocate of breakfast because it lends itself to high-fiber foods such as oats, nuts, and seeds. "It's really easy to get plenty of fiber in at that time of day," he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has two go-to breakfasts that he eats on repeat. The first is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quick-easy-high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-every-morning-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Greek yogurt bowl&lt;/a&gt; with berries, oats, and chia seeds. The second is overnight oats, which he makes with milk, protein powder, berries, honey, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8" data-toc-id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8"&gt;Fiber cupboard&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hobson created a "fiber cupboard" in his kitchen that's packed with fibrous foods. He challenges himself to include something from the cupboard in every meal. "Then at least you know that you are making the effort to do it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stocks up on &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-ways-add-beans-meals-protein-fiber-private-chef-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lentils, beans, pulses&lt;/a&gt;, wholegrain pasta, brown rice, as well as snacks like fruit and nut bars, rye crackers that he likes to pair with some cottage cheese, and seaweed thins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always rooting around for stuff, and I just think having it all in one place is so much easier," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3" data-toc-id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add pulses and legumes to your meal and put the rest into a Tupperware in the fridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to add fiber to a meal is to pour half a can of beans or pulses into it, Hobson said. Just one &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recipes-black-beans-to-reduce-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cup of black beans&lt;/a&gt;, for example, contains 15 grams of fiber. "You can add them to anything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix some into a soup, sauce, or curry, or simply sprinkle a couple of tablespoons on top of a salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not using the whole can, decant the rest into a Tupperware and place it in the fridge, Hobson said. That way, they'll stay fresher for longer and be easily accessible. "Then you don't have to worry about, 'I'm going to waste the rest of the tin,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72" data-toc-id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the food you want to eat visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson recommends keeping the foods you want to eat in a visible spot. That way, you're more likely to reach for them. "Nuts and seeds, always keep them on the side so they're there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that the foods you keep on your countertop could impact your body weight, a factor that can influence cholesterol levels. In a 2015 study published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1090198115610571" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Sage Journals&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Cornell University analyzed the visible foods on 210 countertops in New York and measured their owners' BMIs. They found that those who had just fresh fruit visible weighed an average of 20 pounds less than those who had unhealthier snacks like candy, soda, and cereals on show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's your basic See-Food Diet — you eat what you see," Brian Wansink, the study's lead author, said of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're not ready to make changes to your kitchen layout, Hobson said to stick to one basic principle: "Make sure that you've got a bit of fiber on your plate every day with every meal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

These blockages interfere with the brain's ability to clear harmful substances and may appear well before clear dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clogged pathways are known as "enlarged perivascular spaces," and the findings suggest they could serve as an early warning signal for Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since these brain anomalies can be visually identified on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed to evaluate cognitive decline, identifying them could complement existing methods to detect Alzheimer's earlier, without having to do and pay for additional tests," said Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah from NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Ong, a fifth-year LKCMedicine student and the study's first author, emphasized the importance of early detection. He noted that identifying Alzheimer's sooner gives doctors more time to intervene and potentially slow the progression of symptoms such as memory loss, reduced thinking speed, and mood changes. The research was conducted as part of LKCMedicine's Scholarly Project module in the School's Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Studying Asian Populations Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study stands out because it focuses on Asian populations, an area that has been underrepresented in Alzheimer's research. Most existing studies have concentrated on Caucasian participants, which may limit how broadly their findings apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTU team examined nearly 1,000 people in Singapore from different ethnic backgrounds that reflect the country's population. Participants included individuals with normal cognitive function as well as those experiencing mild thinking difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that dementia does not affect all ethnic groups in the same way, making region specific studies essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For example, among Caucasians with dementia, past studies show that the prevalence of a major risk gene, apolipoprotein E4, linked to Alzheimer's is around 50 to 60 percent. But among Singapore dementia patients, it is less than 20 percent," said Assoc Prof Kandiah, who is also Director of the Dementia Research Centre (Singapore) in LKCMedicine. Because of these differences, findings in one population may not directly apply to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Brain Clears Toxic Waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the brain, blood vessels are surrounded by small channels called perivascular spaces. These spaces help drain toxic waste products, including beta amyloid and tau proteins, which are found in high levels in people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the brain's waste removal system becomes less efficient, these spaces can enlarge and become visible on MRI scans. Until now, it was unclear whether this change was directly linked to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the NTU researchers compared enlarged perivascular spaces with multiple established indicators of Alzheimer's. They also examined how these clogged drainage pathways relate to well known disease markers such as beta amyloid buildup and damage to the brain's white matter, the network of nerve fibers that connects different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing Healthy Brains and Early Cognitive Decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 350 participants with normal thinking abilities, including memory, reasoning, decision making, and focus. The remaining participants showed signs of early cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often precedes dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that people with mild cognitive impairment face a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing MRI scans, the researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment were more likely to have enlarged perivascular spaces than those with no cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Markers Strengthen the Link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to brain scans, the scientists measured seven Alzheimer's related biochemicals in participants' blood, including beta amyloid and tau proteins. Elevated levels of these substances are considered warning signs of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlarged perivascular spaces were linked to four of the seven biochemical measurements. This suggests that people with clogged brain drains are more likely to have increased amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and damage to brain cells, placing them at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at white matter damage, a widely used indicator of Alzheimer's, and found it was associated with six of the seven blood markers. However, further analysis revealed something unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among participants with mild cognitive impairment, the connection between Alzheimer's related biochemicals and enlarged perivascular spaces was stronger than the connection with white matter damage. This finding points to clogged brain drainage as a particularly early signal of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These insights may help doctors make more informed decisions about early treatment strategies, potentially slowing disease progression before lasting brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings carry substantial clinical implications," said Assoc Prof Kandiah. "Although white matter damage is more widely used in clinical practice to evaluate for dementia, as it is easily recognised on MRI scans, our results suggest that enlarged perivascular spaces may hold unique value in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Cheong Chin Yee, a Senior Consultant and Deputy Head at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Department of Geriatric Medicine, said the study highlights the role of small blood vessel changes in Alzheimer's development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings are significant because they suggest that brain scans showing enlarged perivascular spaces could potentially help identify people at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, even before symptoms appear," said Dr. Cheong, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Brain Vessel Disease and Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chong Yao Feng, a Consultant at the National University Hospital's Division of Neurology who was also not involved in the study, noted that cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease have traditionally been viewed as separate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study's findings are intriguing as they demonstrate that both diseases do interact in a synergistic manner," said Dr. Chong, who is also a Clinical Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, doctors reviewing MRI scans should be cautious about assuming cognitive symptoms are caused only by blood vessel problems when markers such as enlarged perivascular spaces are present. These features may also signal a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Doctors will then have to use their clinical judgement of the patient's scan and symptoms, as well as discuss with the patient, to determine if more checks are needed to confirm whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not," said Dr. Chong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Comes Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTU research team plans to track participants over time to determine how many eventually develop Alzheimer's dementia. This follow up will help confirm whether enlarged perivascular spaces can reliably predict progression to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future studies in other populations reach similar conclusions, identifying clogged brain drains on MRI scans could become a routine tool for detecting Alzheimer's risk much earlier than is currently possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Tehseen shared that when gut health is well-balanced, which fermented foods help achieve, brain functions such as mood, stress regulation, and sleep also improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fermented food sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/02/original/bowl-with-yogurt-berries-high-angle_1746163634504.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Add fermented foods like unsweetened yoghurt to diet.

"It's no longer about training ourselves into the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He says smartwatches have revolutionised our understanding of what it means to be fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By tracking our movement and our heart rate they tell us when to have rest days, warn us if we have trained too hard and highlight days when our fitness levels are "peaking".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Now we have more data and understanding of our wellbeing - we can give ourselves a break."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Factor in rest days, reframe them as a way of staying fit, rather than "taking time off", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a95/live/efdaba80-e7ed-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Young women chatting and getting ready" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Recovery is just as important as scheduling training sessions in the week&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And with that, a relatively new acronym will begin to seep into our consciousness, Mr Phillips predicts. This year will be about JOMO instead of FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So many of us can relate to FOMO - the Fear Of Missing Out - but what if we stop trying to keep across everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Why don't we experience JOMO - the Joy Of Missing Out?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;FOMO was first recognised by the Oxford Dictionary back in 2004, where we compare our lives to others, and put pressure on ourselves to keep up in a world that's often been created by our sparkling, shiny socials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now, more than 20 years later, a counter movement is growing to reduce the anxiety that often comes with worrying about what others are doing and trying not to spread ourselves too thinly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's not just as simple as saying no to things, Mr Phillips says, it's about learning to be more comfortable in ourselves and not needing external validation for how we choose to live our lives - whether that's the frequency of our workouts or how often we socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's about understanding what's right for you, and not feeling guilt or shame for prioritising yourself," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Brain boosting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Boosting, that's the key word here," Rachel Chatterton, a product director at Holland Barrett explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Our customers are super interested in anything that gives them a boost - and this year will be about boosting their brain power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nootropics, supplements which purportedly enhance cognition which are sometimes referred to as "smart drugs", have been around for decades, but it's only in the past few years that their appeal has really taken off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These should not be confused with regulated pharmaceutical drugs which can help with conditions like ADHD, narcolepsy and Alzheimer's disease and should only be taken with a diagnosed medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By 2030, the likes of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10675414/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;lion's mane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724001684" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; L-theanine&lt;/a&gt; could be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pharmiweb.com/press-release/2024-03-25/nootropics-market-poised-for-remarkable-growth-to-surpass-usd-137-billion-by-2032-enabling-112#:~:text=Nootropics%20Market%20Poised%20For%20Remarkable%2Cmemory%2C%20creativity%2C%20and%20motivation." class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;commanding an $11bn (£8bn) size slice&lt;/a&gt; of the wellbeing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There may only be a number of small studies that suggest these supplements can improve cognition, enhance memory and reduce stress but Ms Chatterton says the market, especially among Gen Z, is booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Medicinal mushroom powders.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever been about to pour rancid milk down the sink and thought…"Hmm, maybe I shouldn't…"? What about the tomato passata that's gone off? Or the water you washed the paint in? Or that pungent oil from a tuna can?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the wisdom – or not – of putting everyday items down the plughole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they can cause problems by clogging or damaging pipes, creating health hazards and polluting the environment. And they add to the load on wastewater treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where it goes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All indoor wastewater is carried through the sewer system. Everything flushed down the toilet or drained from the kitchen sink, bathtub, or shower connects to the same pipes within our home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-hidden-things-lurking-in-sink-drains-can-be-dangerous-even-deadly"&gt;The Hidden Things Lurking in Sink Drains Can Be Dangerous, Even Deadly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the water flows into the municipal sewer — the large pipes running beneath backyards or streets — and eventually flows to a wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater treatment plants have large aerated tanks full of bacteria that decompose the organic matter in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chemical oxygen demand" measures how much oxygen is needed to break down organic matter. Every bit of additional matter – from passata to tuna oil – adds to the load. And a higher organic load requires greater aeration and larger tanks, thereby increasing the cost and complexity of operating a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/709827/original/file-20251219-56-e3dt6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C281%2C6240%2C3510&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;(&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-metal-objects-7tZ006hSgKE"&gt;Mathias Reding/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spilt milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you pour milk down the sink? Liquid dairy products, or any food item containing fat, oil and grease, including cooking oil, can &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-afternoons/fatberg/105534992"&gt;block sewer pipes&lt;/a&gt;. When oil and grease mix with cool water in wastewater pipes, they harden. Then, they can combine with other waste, such as wet wipes, to form a rock-hard blockage known as a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatberg"&gt;fatberg&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning such blockages is very expensive. For example, in the nine months up to July 2025, Sydney Water spent &lt;a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/this-is-why-water-utilities-want-you-to-water-your-plants-with-milk/4t2usuonc"&gt;A$12 million&lt;/a&gt; dealing with 11,805 "chokes" in the wastewater system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clogged sewers are not just a foul nuisance for the water industry — they are a problem that affects us all. They can trigger the release of raw and &lt;a href="https://www.sydneywater.com.au/water-the-environment/what-you-can-do/avoid-wastewater-overflows.html#:%7E:text=Something%20in%20the%20pipe%20is,contain%20a%20combination%20of%20these."&gt;untreated sewage&lt;/a&gt; into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/this-is-why-water-utilities-want-you-to-water-your-plants-with-milk/4t2usuonc"&gt;Sydney Water&lt;/a&gt; suggests people add water to old milk and pour it in moderation on plants, rather than into the sink. Alternatively, milk can be left in its container and put in your rubbish bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the old and expired sauces, dips and gravy, which often lurk in the fridge at this time of year? These can be &lt;a href="https://www.calgary.ca/waste/what-goes-where/default.html"&gt;composted&lt;/a&gt; or runny sauces can be soaked up with newspaper or paper towels and put in the rubbish bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chemicals like bleach or paint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a cleaning liquid such as bleach is approved to be sold in Australia, use it at the concentration specified on the container. But do not tip concentrated cleaning liquids &lt;a href="https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Waste/industrial-waste/hazardous-and-liquid-wastes"&gt;into the sink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouring your remaining paint or paint-brush cleaning water into the sink is not a good idea. You risk potentially clogging the plumbing system – exposing yourselves to heavy fumes – and pouring flammable liquids down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need an alternative. You could use a disposable brush, or – if the paint job lasts multiple days – wrap the brush in plastic and only clean when done with painting. You can soak the small amount of brush water into an old towel and &lt;a href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/diy-skills/painting/how-to-safely-dispose-of-paint-products?srsltid=AfmBOoo-tpr0bLrU_4uK9MXixQeJaR-f7cciLNhP1VQvZ7JoyoSE8HUv"&gt;dispose&lt;/a&gt; of that in the rubbish bin once the paint has dried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the best way to get rid of potentially hazardous household chemicals such as paint, cleaners, pesticides, motor oil, or cooking oil, is to take them to a &lt;a href="https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Recycling-and-reuse/household-recycling-overview/household-chemical-cleanout"&gt;Household Chemical Cleanout&lt;/a&gt; event. These events are free services held in some &lt;a href="https://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/recycling-and-reducing-waste-at-home/hazardous-household-chemicals/dispose-of-household-chemicals-detox-your-home"&gt;states and territories&lt;/a&gt; specified dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are industries that have funded their own collection schemes, for example, "&lt;a href="https://www.paintback.com.au/find-location"&gt;paintback&lt;/a&gt;" drop off centres. Commercial and industrial entities will need proper &lt;a href="https://recyclingnearyou.com.au/"&gt;recycling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/water/Pages/wastewater.aspx"&gt;treatment processes&lt;/a&gt; in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collective problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not put anything down the sink that we would not want in our waterways. Instead of using sinks as disposal points, households should adopt safer alternatives such as composting food waste and taking hazardous substances to approved chemical cleanout events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not what one individual does, but what everyone in a city contributes together. Small individual actions, when combined across a city, make a significant difference in protecting plumbing infrastructure, public health, and our creeks and oceans.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269701/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The latest report from the CDC shows Texas is one of nine states recording a high number of flu cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When our team spoke to the Houston Health Department this week, the director noted a continued growth in flu cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have seen increases in influenza A in our wastewater monitoring, and we have also seen increases in our health care-related visits, almost double from a month ago," director Dr. Theresa Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The latest figures from the state health and human services department show that across age groups, more people are going to the ER for respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The largest age group visiting the ER for respiratory illness is five to 11-year-olds, making up more than a quarter of visits for that age group. This time last year, that number was closer to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The numbers really began to build around Thanksgiving and have evolved from there. Health experts say that's a trend they expect on some level most years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This year, the trend is slightly higher than last year, so I anticipate the trend is going to continue to rise," Dr. Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to the Houston Methodists' respiratory snapshot, there was a slight decrease in reported flu cases across the health system. The week of Dec.19, Methodist reported 1,051 positive flu A tests, but that number fell to 756 for Christmas week. That number is still higher than this time a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Experts say that symptoms after exposure can pop up in one to four days, and those first days of illness are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;The health department shared the following advice for those battling the flu:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;1. Stay hydrated and fed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;2. An at-home flu test will confirm your suspicions, and drug store medications can help some of those harder symptoms, but won't cure the flu. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;3. Unfortunately, the flu has to run its course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As kids head back to school, the health department warns we aren't out of the woods yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It tends to get higher around January and February, but we have seen spikes in May and in April.

                                &lt;p&gt;ALLENTOWN, Pa. (WFMZ) -- Flu cases are on the rise across the country. This week, the CDC issued an alert that the number of those getting sick is the highest it has seen all season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local pediatrician tells us Lehigh County has had 800 flu cases so far and Northampton County, about 700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those patients were diagnosed over the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehigh Valley Health Network pediatrician Dr. George Nassar has been busy treating sick patients in the ER the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been getting slammed with a lot of flu and RSV. Everyone's getting together with their families over the holidays so there's an increased transmissibility there and then we're also seeing a very strong decline in flu vaccination which I'm sure is playing a role in the number of cases that we're seeing," Nassar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nassar encourages families to isolate if someone is sick and stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If your child has any signs of trouble breathing, if you see their ribs when they're breathing, they're breathing really fast, if their face, lips or skin turns blue or if they have signs of dehydration and they're not drinking or they are persistently vomiting, can't keep anything down. If you have a baby and the baby is not making wet diapers, they should be making at least two wet diapers in twelve hours, those are signs of dehydration that people should look out for," Nassar stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heather Osher, a Medical Director at Patient First, tells us a lot more than just the flu has been going around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been seeing a whole lot of different illnesses. Lots of flu, flu is probably the biggest one that we've been seeing. After that some strep and a lot of GI bugs. The norovirus is a big one that's been going around and then COVID is going around as well," Osher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's also seen cases of people getting a viral infection like the flu or covid and then coming down with a bacterial infection one to two weeks later. She encourages people to get their flu shot as the first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest thing is going to be to get a flu vaccine just because the flu vaccine prevents significant disease, hospitalizations, things like that," Osher explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you start to feel sick, you can take an over-the-counter flu or covid test and the sooner you can get treated, the sooner you'll feel better. As for staying healthy, practice good habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eat a good balanced meal, exercise, get a lot of sleep and just the normal thing is to prevent actually getting it, wash your hands as much as you can, wear a mask, don't touch your face. If you're sick, obviously don't go out, stay home, mask up, that kind of thing," Osher concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says more than 19,000 people nationwide were admitted to the hospital with the flu last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge is being driven by a new strain of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it's a warning sign of what could be a tough flu season ahead, driven largely by a new variant of the influenza A virus known as H3N2 subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Over 620 people were hospitalized across Wisconsin with the flu the week ending Dec. 27, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/respiratory-hospitalizations.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;data show&lt;/a&gt;, more than a two-fold increase from the week prior. The majority were residents ages 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wisconsin is not alone. Flu cases are surging around the U.S., with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;estimating&lt;/a&gt; at least 7.5 million illnesses, 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from the flu so far this season as of Dec. 20. The number of illnesses recorded grew 63% from the week prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The 2025-2026 U.S. flu season's severity level is still classified as low, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/php/surveillance/in-season-severity.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and health experts caution that it's too early to tell the impact of the new variant. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;does predict&lt;/a&gt; that influenza activity will continue for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the Milwaukee area, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/wastewater/influenza-rsv-surveillance.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sharply rising levels of influenza A in wastewater&lt;/a&gt; – one way health officials measure the spread of respiratory disease – indicate sustained activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Last year's flu season was particularly intense in Wisconsin, peaking later in the season with more than 860 people hospitalized with the flu the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/respiratory-hospitalizations.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;week of Feb. 8, 2025.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;State health officials say the best way to avoid the flu is to wash your hands, stay home if you are sick and get the flu vaccine, available to anyone 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To get vaccinated, residents can check with their doctor, health department, pharmacy or other community clinic.

Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific &lt;em&gt;Bacillus &lt;/em&gt;species was identified, &lt;em&gt;B. tropicus &lt;/em&gt;was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speculating risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing &lt;em&gt;Bacillus &lt;/em&gt;in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.&lt;/p&gt;

Tom was born November 10, 1952, to Paul and Mary (Nortmann) Boyd in Iowa City. He spent his formative years in Iowa City, the second youngest in a tight-knit family, showing ponies with his seven siblings as a child and graduating from Regina High School in 1970. Tom was one of the longest living kidney transplant recipients in the world, having received a kidney at age 16 from his sister Marg when organ transplants were a new frontier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from the University of Iowa, Tom worked as an audiologist in public schools where he met his future wife Carole Gilliland (and a cohort of lifelong besties). On September 1, 1979, Tom and Carole were married in Flora, IL. At the ripe old age of 28, he went back to medical school at Des Moines University and graduated in 1987 before taking a job at Burlington Area Family Practice. There, he worked almost 30 years, caring for countless patients at every age and stage of their lives. Tom was especially thankful for his colleagues and his patients-turned-friends who entrusted him with their care and taught him as much as his medical education and residency did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom was a family man through and through. Tom and Carole’s proudest accomplishments were their four kids: Andy, Maggie, Carrie, and Tim. Tom was a devoted husband, dad, father-in-law, and papa. He loved snuggling his grandkids, snacking, public libraries, the beach, Jeopardy!, cheering on the Hawkeyes, traveling, crossword puzzles, lounging by (and obsessively cleaning) the pool, studying maps, and napping while holding an open book. Tom had a debilitating case of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out); being with family and friends was his favorite place to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom wore his heart on his sleeve. He was sweet, soft-spoken, kind, loyal, hardworking, squirrelly, unruffled, and cartoonishly clumsy. He was the ultimate hypeman and his skills as a baby whisperer were unmatched. His family will miss his optimism, humor, generosity, navigational skills, killer dance moves, and seeing him on the beach in Kiawah, South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom is survived by his wife Carole of Burlington; his children, Andy (Emily Ussery) of Atlanta, Maggie (Mark Mannion) of Kansas City, MO, Carrie (Aaron Vanderhoff) of Des Moines, and Tim (Hanna) of La Grange Park, IL; his beloved grandkids (Sylvie, Theo, Rowan, Cooper, and Kellan); his siblings Marg (Dick) McNamara and Bill (Sheila) Boyd; his in-laws Sally Boyd, Marilyn Boyd, Linda Boyd, Dick Jensen, Jon (Debbie) Gilliland, and Joe (Jane) Gilliland; and numerous nieces and nephews. Tom is preceded in death by his parents, his siblings Mary Ellen Jensen, Mike, Pat, Jerry, Debbie Jensen, and his brother-in-law Jim Jensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family would like to thank the many, many doctors, nurses, medical professionals, and blood donors who were a part of Tom’s legendary run. He was particularly grateful to the outstanding staff of Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center, including Southeastern Renal Dialysis and Southeast Iowa Hospice, for their excellent care. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitation will be from 4:00 PM until 7:00 PM Friday, January 9, 2026 at Prugh Funeral Service, 3940 Division Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A celebration of life for Dr. Boyd will be 11:00 AM Saturday, January 10, 2026, at First Congregational Church, 313 N. 4th Street, where Tom was a proud member and served on the trustee board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the National Kidney Foundation, the Burlington Public Library, the Food Bank of Iowa, or become a blood donor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Continued Maggie: "Oh, the pain is indescribable. And yet, you have shown us in multiple ways that you are with us. It’s not the same joy as holding your hand or hearing your voice, but there is an unexplainable joy that only comes with knowing you are with Jesus. That you are in our true home. And that you are very, very happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Please continue to visit me and help mama keep going.

                &lt;p&gt;After studying stem cell aging for decades, Dr. Thomas Rando learned that some of the best &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-longevity-exercise-diet-aging-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity advice&lt;/a&gt; is timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I often make the joke that the billions of dollars that have been spent on studying healthy aging could come down to the two things your mother told you," Rando, the president of the American Federation for Aging Research and director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, told Business Insider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eat a good diet and get plenty of exercise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando dedicated his career to studying how tissues repair themselves — and why they eventually lose the ability to do it well. What he learned is that many of the drugs tested in animals that are meant to extend lifespan work as effectively as a balanced &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-longevity-researcher-follows-for-healthy-aging-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diet and exercise do&lt;/a&gt;. One example was a 2022 study that found mice that were put on fasting diets were as resilient to stress as those injected with ketone bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that many drugs and interventions are "just in a way supplementing the challenges that humans face in dieting and exercising."&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his own life, he said his research hasn't inspired too many drastic lifestyle changes as much as reinforcing healthy habits, like cutting ultra-processed foods after college or continuing to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-year-unhealthy-moderate-drinking-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;drink in moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of his peers in the field, he &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/supplements" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;doesn't take any supplements&lt;/a&gt;; he's more persuaded that lifestyle habits such as eating whole foods and taking care of his body are the keys to longevity. "From my own studies, if you are eating well, sleeping well, and exercising, it's unlikely that supplements are going to make a difference," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando shared the three longevity habits he's stuck to for years, from avid running to lots of socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5d6796db-c8f1-4002-9325-7acd345896b9" data-toc-id="5d6796db-c8f1-4002-9325-7acd345896b9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He started running in his 30s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By his 30s, Rando realized his work schedule made it hard to exercise: organizing basketball or squash games just took too much time. So, he started running solo a few miles a day, a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a colleague convinced him to run a 5K, he fell in love with racing. He worked his way up to a 10K, half-marathon, and eventually, a marathon. He's been a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-ran-my-first-marathon-advice-mistakes-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;marathon runner&lt;/a&gt; for the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not that people should do marathons, but I really believe in the rejuvenating powers of exercise," Rando said. While he's still researching all the ways that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-scientist-shared-his-weekly-workout-routine-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;working out benefits longevity&lt;/a&gt;, he said there's lots of evidence to support that regular exercise lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando, who's currently dealing with an Achilles tendon injury, said he's running a little less often and focusing a little more on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/exercise-for-healthy-aging-longevity-strength-training-personal-trainer-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, which is also important for healthy aging as muscle mass declines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the anti-aging benefits, he said he loves how running makes him feel. "I think clearly, I think I solve problems when I run," he said. "So that was an added icing on the cake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7d009965-fefe-45cd-98cb-fe50527e38cf" data-toc-id="7d009965-fefe-45cd-98cb-fe50527e38cf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He fasts one day a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rando generally follows the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, considered the healthiest diet in the world. He eats lean protein, fruits, and vegetables while cutting back on red meat, carbohydrates, and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love a steak dinner, and I'll splurge on that," Rando said. "But my typical dinners are either purely vegetarian or with some light meat or some fish."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, he's practiced a form of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-benefits-and-risks-for-longevity-weight-loss-cancer-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; where he doesn't eat breakfast. He usually has a light lunch of edamame and hard-boiled eggs, and eats his biggest meal at dinner. Some studies find that intermittent fasting can help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-burn-fat-control-blood-sugar-study-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;control blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and burn fat, while others show &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-linked-higher-risk-of-early-death-controversial-study-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mixed evidence&lt;/a&gt; that intermittent fasting has sustained benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Rando also &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-tried-intermittent-fasting-like-elon-musk-for-a-month-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fasts for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; once a week, another form of time-restricted eating. Because dinner is his biggest meal, he usually starts fasting until dinner the next day, rather than starting the fast in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he isn't super strict about fasting. "My lifestyle is just not conducive to fasting multiple days in a row, partly because of the exercise, partly because I'm going to dinners and lunches with people," he said. "But I do believe in fasting as a means toward healthy aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because intermittent fasting is still being studied, including any potential &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-linked-higher-risk-of-early-death-controversial-study-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;long-term risks&lt;/a&gt;, Rando considers it "a leap of faith."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe from the science that this will have a long-term benefit," he said. But it's not because he feels the same immediate effects as he does from exercising. "I just feel hungry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="79f543fd-3c7e-4043-b25b-91b16aa4e42c" data-toc-id="79f543fd-3c7e-4043-b25b-91b16aa4e42c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socializing at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As president of AFAR, Rando naturally interacts with a lot of people. "Through my work, I lead a very social life," he said, including collaborating with other researchers, sitting on various committees, and attending events. He said he also makes it a point to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retirement-isolation-friends-rejection-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;socialize outside work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he said it's harder to quantify the impact of social ties on longevity, there's a lot of compelling anecdotal evidence in favor of it. Some of it comes from Rando's own research: &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-habits-from-96-year-old-doctor-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Dr. Ira Eliasoph&lt;/a&gt;, a 96-year-old AFAR study participant, said strong relationships helped him live a long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe in the evidence that social interactions are really important as people get older," Rando said.&lt;/p&gt;

Only one of the infections involved a fully vaccinated person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly infectious and sometimes deadly virus, was declared eliminated in the US more than 25 years ago. But the past year has presented increasing challenges to maintaining that status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diseases are generally declared eliminated when there is no local transmission in a given region, although cases can still be “imported” from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US’s elimination status is largely credited to the success of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1963, the first measles vaccine was licensed in the US, and by 1971, the combination MMR vaccine was unveiled to protect against the three illnesses at once. Two shots are typically recommended to achieve full vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, in 1978, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set 1982 as a deadline to achieve the elimination of measles in the country. It missed that target by nearly 18 years, reaching elimination status in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccine hesitancy has been blamed for allowing the virus to spread in the US, both then and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the death rate for measles is relatively low, its infection rate is high. The CDC estimates that, if one person has the virus, they could infect nine out of every 10 people around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization says that, for every 1,000 reported cases, there are about two to three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are especially vulnerable. Complications can include high fever, hearing or vision loss and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, medical professionals recommend children be vaccinated early in their lives, receiving their first dose before 15 months of age and their second by age six. The vaccine is widely accepted as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccine scepticism has been on the rise in the US, with critics blaming, in part, policies implemented under the administration of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CDC data, the MMR vaccination rate in the US was 95.2 percent among kindergarteners during the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number, however, tumbled to 92.7 percent by the 2023-2024 school year, representing a difference of 280,000 kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 represented a high-water mark in the resurgence of the measles virus. The CDC reported 2,065 cases of measles last year, the most since 1991 — and more than seven times the rate of 2024, when only 285 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest outbreaks took place in Texas, where three people died from the virus, with the first reported last February. Prior to that incident, no death had been reported from measles in the US &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/27/us-reports-first-measles-death-since-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of that death, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;encouraged&lt;/a&gt; vaccination, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; on social media, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy, who is not a medical professional, has since expressed views that appeared to discourage the vaccine’s use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late April, for instance, he told NewsNation, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts, however, have denounced that claim as false. While the rubella part of the vaccine was developed using a cell culture that came from an elective abortion in the 1960s, no fetal tissue has been used since, nor is there any fetal issue in the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has also spread unfounded claims that purport to link vaccination to autism, despite widespread outcry from the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Carolina, the current measles outbreak is concentrated in the northwest. The South Carolina Department of Public Health says that the reported infections are largely in children under the age of 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Democratic candidate running in the state’s 2026 midterm elections, paediatrician Annie Andrews, has made combating the outbreak a central part of her campaign. She hopes to unseat incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, in November’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you told me back in medical school that someday I would be running for the Senate and my campaign slogan would be ‘It’s me or the measles’ I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT HAVE BELIEVED YOU,” she wrote on social media on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>纽约流感住院治疗人数创历史新高--哥谭氏症患者</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/flu-hospitalizations-in-new-york-hit-record-high</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2ijth"&gt;More than 4,500 New York residents were hospitalized with the flu last week — marking the highest number ever recorded in a single week, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1d72n"&gt;The state Department of Health said there were 4,546 flu hospitalizations last week, a 24% increase from the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2isf3"&gt;Health officials are warning of severe influenza cases and spread season and are urging people to get vaccinated if they haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cm3lt"&gt;“We are having a more severe flu season than prior years, almost 1,000 more people were admitted to a hospital during this most recent seven-day period compared to the prior week,” state Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dit5g"&gt;“There is still time to get a flu shot and remember, flu can be treated with antiviral medication if started within 48 hours of symptom onset and your doctor deems appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4atju"&gt;The number of people diagnosed with the flu overall — not just those who were hospitalized — also reached a record &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-state-has-set-a-record-for-flu-cases-ahead-of-peak-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high last month&lt;/a&gt; of more than 72,000.

But no one until now has claimed that a pint could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then came Chris Buck, a virologist at the National Cancer Institute, who is also an enthusiastic home brewer. Dr Buck believes he has created the world’s first beer vaccine. He brewed the first batch last summer using a yeast modified to contain a vaccine protein. It was a Lithuanian-style farmhouse ale that was awfully drinkable, and also appeared to immunise him against a virus linked to certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://link.thetimes.co.uk/join/74t/signup-us?source=WebsiteArticle" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up for The Times’s weekly US newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These tests suggested he had developed antibodies against two types of BK polyomavirus thought to cause certain types of bladder cancer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In Buck’s view, this only the start of what a beer could do. “This one vaccine is just proving the principle,” he said. “Next on the agenda is Covid and flu and probably herpes viruses and adenovirus [associated with mild colds and flu] … Anything that is a common-cold virus is in our crosshairs now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.4"&gt;&lt;div id="4b8161cc-ef17-499e-a054-980d0b7b55d2"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The beer is a Lithuanian-style farmhouse ale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nor does a vaccine have to be delivered in a beer. Buck, 55, thinks the modified yeast could be used to make yoghurt, or crisps, that could confer a similar immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scientist does not usually whip up experiments in his kitchen, and some of his peers are now alarmed that his homebrew adventures could damage public trust in vaccines. They also warn that one beer drinker conducting tests on himself does not establish the efficacy of a supposed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I disagree,” said Buck, who has been a scientist at the National Institutes of Health since 2001. “I think if a food vaccine works in one person that tells you something very important, which is that it can work in &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Vaccines are often made inside insect cells, but they can also be created in yeast cells: there is then a tricky “purification” process, stripping everything else away to leave a protein particle for injection. “It eventually just occurred to me, like maybe we don’t have to purify,” he said. Perhaps the yeast could simply be eaten, or drunk in a foaming pint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The conventional wisdom is that this does not work because vaccine proteins are broken down by stomach acid, he said. This proved true when Buck and his colleagues fed mice with ground-up yeast containing vaccine proteins, supplied by a Lithuanian scientist named Alma Gedvilaite. But when they tried whole, live yeast containing the virus particles, the mice developed “robust antibody responses”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I literally felt weak at the knees,” Buck said. “I could see that this meant that the vaccine could be a food. And if it can be a food, it means you can regulate it like a food and it’s easy to distribute and many people will be happier about it than a shot. All of these implications were there at that first experiment a year and a half ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Buck initially started working on potential vaccines for HIV, HPV and polyomaviruses. “Their name is ancient Greek for ‘many tumours’,” he said of the latter. “It causes cancer in mice for sure.” They can also cause serious problems for transplant patients taking immunosuppresant drugs. Buck’s laboratory at the National Cancer Institute is working with the biotech company Biological E on a vaccine for polyomaviruses that would be administered by injection, but they are still some distance from clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/measles-30-year-high-rfkj-cdc-9mqtjjxw0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;US measles cases surpass 2,000 for first time in 30 years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A food-based, or beer-based vaccine, available at once, could potentially save lives, he said. “Anyone who is waiting for a transplant would like this vaccine,” he said. “If I were waiting for a transplant I would get it immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Besides being suspected of causing cancer, the polyomavirus can cause a painful bladder condition in patients who receive bone-marrow transplants. Buck recalls visiting a paediatric hospital that had installed sound-proofing in its lavatories to dampen the sounds of children with the condition screaming in the middle of the night. It may also cause a painful bladder condition in older women, he said. Patients with it “shed a lot of polyomavirus in their urine”, he said. “That’s not causality … but [if] you have painful bladder syndrome, you brew beer, you drink beer, and if the pain goes away, then you say ‘Yahtzee’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He said he tried to put the beer idea before an institutional review board at the National Institutes of Health. “A senior official in the chain bounced away the application before it could be considered,” he said. “The friction was that the institution is not accustomed to thinking about food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He thinks they were trying to assess it the way they would a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Buck didn’t have much patience for that red tape. “Instead of trying to convince them what the law was, I basically demonstrated what the law was by doing it in my kitchen,” he said. He got his younger brother Andrew to form a company, and sell batches of the beer to two close friends. “We just need a company with a record of sales,” said Buck, who lives in Bethesda, Maryland. “If something is already in the food supply and doesn’t appear to be causing problems, then the manufacturer can just say, look, it’s generally recognised as safe because it’s already there and we don’t know of any problems.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over the summer, after drinking his own beer but before tests showed he had developed antibodies, Buck spoke at a virology conference in southern Italy. Michael Imperiale, a virologist and emeritus professor at the University of Michigan Medical School, watched his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I said: ‘What are you going to do if someone has a bad reaction to this?’” Imperiale said. He felt that one man and his brother drinking a beer vaccine was not enough to show that something was safe. He said that trials on, say, a thousand people with diverse genetics would be required. But his main concern was that with Robert F Kennedy Jr, a famous vaccine sceptic who as US health secretary has diminished trust in vaccines, it could make matters worse to have a government scientist brewing them in his kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The US government itself is trying to actively get people to be against vaccines, right?” Imperiale said. “We, the scientific community, really have to keep that in mind … Is what we’re doing going to enhance the public trust or is it going to make it worse?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.24"&gt;&lt;div id="a6cd19d8-50d5-4944-beca-8f518387f398"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The beer becomes fluorescent under blue light&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Several other scientists have told Science News, which first reported on Buck’s vaccine beer, that they have similar concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But Buck says his own mother is an antivaxer. “She lives in eastern Washington state, which is a very rural environment. All of her church friends are antivaxers,” he said. “I used to agree with the view that the solution to distrust of vaccines was to raise our safety standards and have more and more stringent qualifications for vaccines that hit the market. And with hindsight, I think it backfired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He thinks scientists’ efforts to show that they take elaborate care with a vaccine — Buck refers to it as “security theatre” — only made people think: “Wow, that thing must be really dangerous.” But producing a vaccine that people can make in their own kitchen proves a vaccine “is just some ordinary thing that is not that dangerous”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On December 17, Buck and his brother published a non-peer-reviewed paper, &lt;i&gt;Vaccine Beer: A Personal Healthcare Report&lt;/i&gt;, which contained recipes for vaccine beer. In the coming months, he hopes to persuade a company to manufacture the modified yeast and to find a brewer willing to make a line of what he calls VAC-beer (Vaccine Antigen Containing) for sale in North America. (He doubts it could be sold in Britain or Europe, given the regulations on genetically modified foodstuffs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I don’t know what Robert Kennedy is going to make of this,” he said. “This is my boss’s boss’s boss and I do not know whether he will think: ‘Oh, it looks like health food, I love it!’ Or: ‘Oh, it looks like a vaccine, I hate it.’ I have no idea how that’s going to come out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/vaccine-sceptic-conspiracist-liar-its-rfk-jr-ts9pkvpv7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccine sceptic, conspiracist, ‘liar’: it’s Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What about his mother?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Mom seems entirely amenable to beer vaccine,” he said. “But I wouldn’t call it an informative datapoint because my love for food and home fermentation projects was inherited directly from her.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers describe the fossil site as a kind of prehistoric &lt;strong&gt;evolutionary laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;versatile, experimental species&lt;/em&gt; thrived. It’s a reminder that major evolutionary leaps didn’t just happen in famous fossil beds like the &lt;strong&gt;Burgess Shale&lt;/strong&gt;, but also in places long overlooked by science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, scientists led by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giovanni-Mussini" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giovanni Mussini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Cambridge found the fossil trove along the Colorado River and brought samples back to the UK for detailed study. Hidden inside these Grand Canyon rocks were the carbon-rich remnants of &lt;strong&gt;tiny crustaceans, mollusks&lt;/strong&gt;, and an unusually toothy worm named &lt;em&gt;Kraytdraco spectatus&lt;/em&gt;, a name inspired by a creature from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The findings were published last week in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this site stand out is the &lt;strong&gt;exceptional preservation&lt;/strong&gt; of soft tissues. Most Cambrian fossils come from anoxic environments that prevent decay. But this ancient community lived in &lt;strong&gt;oxygenated, storm-prone shallows&lt;/strong&gt;, which aren’t typically known for preserving soft bodies. The fact that these fossils survived suggests something remarkable about how these animals lived, and died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Glimpse Into Soft-Bodied Cambrian Life&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, the Bright Angel Formation offers the first detailed record of soft-bodied animals in an oxygen-rich Cambrian shelf environment, unlike the low-oxygen deep sea settings of the &lt;em&gt;Chengjiang&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Burgess Shale&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers recovered over 1,500 small carbonaceous fossils&lt;strong&gt; (SCFs)&lt;/strong&gt;, many of which belonged to &lt;em&gt;Kraytdraco&lt;/em&gt;, a now-extinct priapulid worm with &lt;strong&gt;branching tooth-like structures&lt;/strong&gt; in its feeding apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These teeth, preserved in incredible three-dimensional detail, show adaptations for &lt;strong&gt;both scraping and filtering&lt;/strong&gt;, an unusual combination rarely seen in a single organism. As Dr. Mussini explained to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;It sharpens our understanding of the economics of early animal evolution&lt;/em&gt;.” The feeding system resembled a modern conveyor belt, with one region scooping food from the surface while another filtered organic matter from the sediment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This dual strategy might have helped the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/earth-first-animal-alive-541-million-year/" data-type="post" data-id="89625"&gt;animal &lt;/a&gt;thrive in &lt;strong&gt;turbulent, nutrient-rich waters&lt;/strong&gt;, offering flexibility in changing conditions. That adaptability sets it apart from many Cambrian creatures, which often followed more rigid ecological roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fossils Paint a Picture of Complex Early Ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond Kraytdraco, the researchers found fragments of &lt;strong&gt;slug-like mollusks&lt;/strong&gt; with scraping radulae and &lt;strong&gt;crustaceans&lt;/strong&gt; with molar-like chewing plates, organisms that point to &lt;strong&gt;sophisticated food webs&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv6383" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these creatures show “a wide range of coexisting derived taxa and sophisticated feeding adaptations” uncommon in typical Cambrian sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiny structures in the sediment even captured &lt;strong&gt;scraping marks&lt;/strong&gt; left behind by mollusks feeding on microbial mats. The presence of burrows, trace fossils, and complex sediment layering supports the idea of a storm-driven shallow sea, where food sources were patchy and animals had to be agile and opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As study co-author &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1258-3525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Hagadorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;By combining these fossils with traces of their burrowing, walking and feeding… we’re able to piece together an entire ancient ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;.” The fossil bed’s richness rivals the most studied Cambrian sites, but in a very different environmental context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Preservation Without the Usual Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the best-preserved Cambrian fossils are found in low-oxygen “dead zones” where &lt;strong&gt;decomposition slows&lt;/strong&gt; and scavengers are few. But this find challenges that idea. According to the team’s research, the Grand Canyon’s &lt;strong&gt;well-oxygenated seafloor&lt;/strong&gt; supported intense biological activity, and still managed to &lt;strong&gt;preserve soft tissues&lt;/strong&gt; in exquisite detail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is unusual. Oxygen typically accelerates decay, making it rare for delicate structures to fossilize. The key, scientists believe, may lie in the &lt;strong&gt;rapid burial during storm events&lt;/strong&gt;, which swept sediment over the seafloor, preserving the remains before they could decompose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used &lt;strong&gt;hydrofluoric acid&lt;/strong&gt; to dissolve shale samples and isolate the fossils, a delicate and risky method few teams employ. As Mussini explained to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;There’s no guarantee of success, and few people have used this technique to explore Cambrian ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unexpected preservation quality, combined with the environmental richness, has led some scientists to refer to the Bright Angel Formation as a kind of &lt;strong&gt;Cambrian ‘evolutionary cradle’&lt;/strong&gt;, a place where early animals not only survived, but evolved rapidly and creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An Ancient Hotspot Hidden in Plain Sight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Grand Canyon’s fossil-bearing rocks have been studied for over a century, yet their most fascinating secrets have only just come to light. The &lt;strong&gt;Bright Angel Formation&lt;/strong&gt;, running along 300 miles of canyon walls, had long been considered well understood. But this study shows that under the right lens, even familiar ground can &lt;strong&gt;reveal the unexpected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Karma Nanglu&lt;/em&gt;, a Harvard paleontologist not involved in the study, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;This site does show quite a unique assemblage of animals&lt;/em&gt;.” While he cautions that broader statistical comparisons are needed to confirm whether it was more diverse than other Cambrian ecosystems, the evidence is already reshaping how scientists think about where early animal life took root.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a narrow band of greenish shale in the Grand Canyon, scientists are now uncovering a picture of the Cambrian period that’s more complex, more dynamic, and far more competitive than previously imagined. And there may be more secrets buried in those cliffs, waiting for the right moment, or the right storm, to reveal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research reveals","elementId":"180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/18/artificial-intelligence-uk-emotional-support-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/warning-ai-chatbots-inaccurate-financial-advice-tips-chatgpt-copilot-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gave inaccurate financial advice&lt;/a&gt;, while similar concerns have been raised about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5ggew08eyo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summaries of news stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:17,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQXBwR0FUdTRWaVBla050WU9xQW9YMDlERXdOc2hnZ0pLS2FBbjhmMmZaZ1ZKSTZNTUdMekc1ZmZWcExJaGRTVFctYm94dHlJZVNOOWJhOVdFcVdrVWx0RjZuSzhmeEdxbVRsRElfNDdMUERxVHNic293NVMyT1N2aDlRT09KMnY0NHkwODZlUzYwNjVtVDFtdlkyZ2JxWS1KMWwwRU1nTXRTNGk4a3dv</guid></item><item><title>专家遵循6条长寿规则，在2026年实现更健康的衰老-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/6-longevity-rules-experts-follow-healthier-aging-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

                &lt;p&gt;The influenza season is in full swing, and it’s already proving to be deadly for some of the most vulnerable Americans around: children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several states have reported their first pediatric flu deaths this week. Cases and hospitalizations are rising across the country as well, while some areas are experiencing record-level surges of illness. The season is being driven by the emergence of an unexpected strain of the H3N2 flu, named subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tragic deaths&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to the holidays, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;most current flu data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is nearly two weeks old. Yet it’s still evident that this season is gearing up to be a nasty one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of December 20, flu activity was high or very high in 32 regions of the U.S. and moderate in eight other jurisdictions. The cumulative flu hospitalization rate in week 51 was also the third highest it’s been at this point in the past 15 years (the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons were the other two).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things have been even worse for some states. Last week, for example, New York health officials &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-26_flu_cases.htm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; experiencing the largest weekly surge in flu cases ever recorded in modern history—71,123 positive flu cases during the week of December 20.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At least eight pediatric flu deaths this winter have also been recorded by the CDC so far, though local health officials and members of the public have documented more since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 30, for instance, the Kentucky Department for Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Kentucky%20Reports%201st%20Pediatric%20Influenza%20Death%20This%20Respiratory%20Virus%20Season.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death of the 2025-26 season: a child from Kenton County who did not receive a flu vaccination. The next day, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death, which involved a teenager from Greene County. And on Thursday, Paul Kim, a popular social media influencer and Minnesota resident, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/catholic-influencers-5-year-old-son-dies-contracting-flu-rcna251834"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that his five-year-old son died after contracting a severe bout of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This death is tragic and our hearts go out to the family,” said Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, in a &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It also reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat, and we urge parents to protect their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A record bad winter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even during a typical winter, the seasonal flu will sicken millions of Americans, hospitalize hundreds of thousands, and kill tens of thousands. But it’s certainly possible that we could be in for two straight bad seasons in a row. Last winter, at least 280 children in the U.S. died of the flu, the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/more-kids-are-dying-from-seasonal-flu-than-ever-2000668078"&gt;highest death toll&lt;/a&gt; in children for a non-pandemic flu seen in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This season is being fueled by the emergence of subclade K, an H3N2 variant noticeably different on a genetic level from the flu strains scientists predicted would be circulating this season. Since its arrival toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, K has quickly taken over as the leading cause of flu cases worldwide, including in the U.S. Though the variant doesn’t appear to cause &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;more severe infections&lt;/a&gt; on average than other H3N2 strains, it has caused strong, early, or prolonged waves of illness in various parts of the world, including the &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/12/02/japan/science-health/flu-season/"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701333/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to subclade K, it’s still worth getting your shot if you haven’t already. Data from the UK has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D." target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that vaccination this season is still effective at preventing serious flu complications, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is the immune system’s natural response to injury and illness, helping the body heal and recover. When inflammation becomes chronic, however, it can drive a range of conditions, including metabolic disease, autoimmune disorders, and certain cancers. Diet plays a key role in regulating inflammation—including what you drink. Here are six anti-inflammatory beverages to consider.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea is packed with plant compounds called catechins, which help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/oxidative-stress-8661281" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and inflammatory markers in the body, said &lt;a href="https://healncure.com/best-functional-medicine-doctor-in-glenview/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meena Malhotra, MD, ABOM, ABIM&lt;/a&gt;, a functional and integrative medicine physician and medical director at Heal n Cure. “One to two cups a day is enough to see a benefit for most people without needing to overdo caffeine,” she told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. To maximize its anti-inflammatory potential, skip added sugar, which can actually increase inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-tart-cherry-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block healthdotcom-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tart cherries are rich in anthocyanins, natural pigments that have been shown to reduce inflammation and muscle soreness and may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/condition/sleep/sleep-drinks" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you’re trying to loosen up stiff joints or sore muscles, tart cherry juice can be a game changer,”&lt;a href="https://jackienewgent.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian, chef, and author of &lt;em&gt;The Plant-Based Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;, told&lt;em&gt; Health. &lt;/em&gt;“Sipping half a cup of tart cherry juice twice a day may be helpful for providing anti-inflammatory benefits throughout the day.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because 100% tart cherry juice, the type that offers the most benefits, contains natural—not added—sugars and has a strong flavor, you may want to dilute it with water. Drinking about 4 to 6 ounces at a time can make it more palatable while still delivering benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-kombucha"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that kombucha—a fizzy, fermented tea drink containing probiotics—has anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is largely attributed to polyphenols, plant compounds that act as antioxidants by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/what-is-a-free-radical-8771647" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;neutralizing harmful free radicals&lt;/a&gt; and reducing oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kombucha also contains organic acids produced during fermentation, which may further support its anti-inflammatory effects, &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/amy-goldsmith?utm_source=google" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Goldsmith, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Kindred Nutrition &amp;amp; Kinetics, told &lt;em&gt;Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There is no specific dose that proves kombucha will decrease inflammation—however, it's suggested to drink 4 to 8 ounces a day,” Goldsmith said. “Drinking more than 12 ounces a day could lead to GI disruption.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-ginger-tea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger contains nearly 40 anti-inflammatory compounds—including gingerols, which can “help calm inflammatory pathways and also support digestion, which indirectly lowers inflammation,” Malhotra said. “We see benefits even with small amounts, like a cup of fresh ginger tea once daily, especially after meals.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from free radicals that can contribute to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/chronic-inflammation-how-to-know-if-you-have-it-8716462" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The spice turmeric contains curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory compound, &lt;a href="https://sacredheart.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/jacqueline-a-vernarelli/#:~:text=About-,Jacqueline%20A.,the%20College%20of%20Health%20Professions." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jacqueline Vernarelli, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, nutritional epidemiologist, public health nutritionist, and associate professor of public health at Sacred Heart University, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While turmeric tea is widely available, you can also try &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/ways-to-add-turmeric-to-your-diet-11697592" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;golden milk&lt;/a&gt;, a latte-like drink made with turmeric and other ingredients, such as dairy or plant milk, ginger, cinnamon, honey or maple syrup, a pinch of black pepper, and ghee or coconut oil. Curcumin has low bioavailability, meaning it’s hard for the body to absorb on its own, but the fat and black pepper in golden milk help increase its effectiveness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-pomegranate-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;figcaption id="mntl-figure-caption_6-0" class="comp mntl-figure-caption type-label--md figure-article-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="figure-article-caption-text"&gt;Pomegranate Juice.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="figure-article-caption-owner"&gt;Linda Lewis/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Newgent called pomegranate juice a “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/polyphenols-8707608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyphenol powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;.” These compounds, particularly punicalagins, “are known for ‘cooling down’ systemic inflammation,” he said. They can lower levels of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/c-reactive-protein-test-8403551" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, a key marker of inflammation in the body. “Drinking about a cup a day of 100% pomegranate juice is a delicious way to help your cells bounce back from everyday stress,” Newgent added.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not a fan of pomegranate juice? Other options include 100% grape or berry juice, which contain anthocyanins—a type of polyphenol—as well as resveratrol, another anti-inflammatory compound. “These compounds are well-studied and have been shown to function as antioxidants,” Vernarelli said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diluting these juices in water can also help mellow their tartness.&lt;br&gt;
