Once they develop an infection, the symptoms will vary. NDM-CRE can cause such ailments as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and wound infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms can include fever, chills with cough, shortness of breath if the bacteria infect the lung, and pain or blood when urinating if the bladder/kidneys are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the bacteria are resistant to most antibiotics, treatment options are severely limited, leading to slower recovery and higher risk of serious complications or death, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason health officials are concerned is because the bacteria can spread to others and survive on contaminated surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can test for NDM-CRE, but most people do not need to be tested unless they are at higher risk for having it, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those at risk are people who have been “in a hospital (especially in another country), had repeated antibiotics, hospital stays, or invasive medical procedures, or if you’re sick and been in contact with someone known to have NDM-CRE,” Gohil said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing for the bacteria is also difficult because many hospitals and clinics do not have the tools to rapidly detect it in patients even when the patient is not sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-ndm-cre" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against NDM-CRE&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;NDM-CRE is caused by overuse of powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be an opportunity for us to change the narrative where all patients typically want antibiotics,” Nanda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda advises patients who are being prescribed with antibiotics to ask their healthcare provider:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why they’re getting prescribed the antibiotics? Why is it necessary? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your options. Make sure you’ve exhausted all other treatments options before going straight to antibiotics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need it, you need it, but then be judicious about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because NDM-CRE infections happen to people who are very sick, patients in hospitals or in long-term care, experts recommend that patients, healthcare staff and visitors in these settings wash their hands and avoid contact with dirty surfaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 01:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxQcDlJMENRU1RkOHlObHhmWVNaMksxekFZaHhIcTZKanJDLXZTem9EUVJ6cF95WEtNdk9wRTVMUGtoLVN2bFRoYTZSNWQ0cGJuR3dQSlpsVWxteGxVV1BTNzNPUl9ZSF9xMU5WWmRnUUw5b2ZHeGY5anpaLUpLNU1uZ3VkLUVZdkhyOEI1UUtmeGNKNk1zNXc4aExTdmpNV1Q1YW93dlhHUmI2UVJlTzhKQ2VHd3JNNFVuSmUxNGMyOVJidzFFY0tVdldXT04zVC1lMjlIR2tGTlg</guid></item><item><title>贝尔法斯特心理健康单位：睡在沙发上的患者- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8edjj0x8xo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Mental health patients sleeping on sofas months after issues found&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf61/live/2fe0aa30-99f7-11f0-97f5-bd38218a3641.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Green signage reading 'Acute Mental Health Inpatient Centre'.

Found in virtually every tissue in the body, prostaglandins react to pain by producing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lowering excessive amounts of inflammation helps stop pain signals, small amounts of inflammation are crucial for helping the body fight off infections and heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means taking an NSAID not only eases pain but also reduces essential inflammation the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at NYU Langone Pain Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-25841710-9a20-11f0-b3ef-a9cd0ad000c9"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, however, discovered how to target prostaglandin-producing receptors without eliminating vital inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, the researchers looked specifically at prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in Schwann cells, which are found outside the brain in the peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This system is a network of nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body and Schwann cells are thought to be behind migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York City are testing the effects of pain relievers that target pain but not inflammation, which is needed in small doses for healing and fighting off infections (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said drugs that target pain but not inflammation would reduce the need for NSAIDs, which are sold under brand names like Advil (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found PGE2 has four different receptors. Of those, the team found that EP2 specifically is responsible for pain, while EP4 influences inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then used unspecified pre-clinical drugs on mice to target just the EP2 receptor. This reduced pain without affecting inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pierangelo Geppetti, study author and adjunct professor at the NYU Pain Research Center, said: 'Inflammation can be good for you - it repairs and restores normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inhibiting inflammation with NSAIDs may delay healing and could delay recovery from pain. A better strategy to treat prostaglandin-mediated pain would be to selectively reduce the pain without affecting inflammation’s protective actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery comes amid a rift in the scientific community regarding another pain reliever, acetaminophen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15123181/trump-links-tylenol-autism-cause-leucovorin.html"&gt;President Donald Trump earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; tied the pain reliever acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, during pregnancy to an increased risk of a child developing autism, despite inconclusive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63782-8"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at samples of human Schwann cells to determine which receptors to target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at mouse models, the team found injecting pre-clinical drugs, or those that are being studied but are not available to the public, into mice reduced their pain levels while leaving inflammation untouched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'To our great surprise, blocking the EP2 receptor in Schwann cells abolished prostaglandin-mediated pain but the inflammation took its normal course. We effectively decoupled the inflammation from the pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study findings come days after President Donald Trump (pictured here with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr) tied pain reliever acetaminophen to autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is sold under the brand name Tylenol, as well as other over-the-counter medications like Benadryl (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Developing drugs that only target EP2 would effectively eliminate the need for NSAIDs, which make up 30billion doses in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And long-term NSAID use has also been tied to gastrointestinal and kidney damage, so the researchers believe moving away from NSAIDs would help reduce these risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostaglandins also stimulate the production of a protective mucus lining in the stomach, so a reduction in all prostaglandins - which occurs when NSAIDs target all receptors, not just the one that controls pain - wears away at that layer and leaves the stomach lining vulnerable to acid and other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSAIDs also reduce blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it harder for the stomach lining to repair itself. Blood flow to the kidneys is also reduced, which hampers function over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear which specific drugs the researchers used in the study and when they might be available to the public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'Selective EP2 receptor antagonists could be very useful. While more research is needed on side effects, especially with giving a drug systemically as a pill, targeted administration that acts locally on an area like a knee joint holds promise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, highly potent class of immunotherapeutics with unique Velcro-like binding properties can kill diverse cancer types without harming normal tissue, University of California, Irvine cancer researchers have demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team led by Michael Demetriou, MD, Ph.D., has reported that by targeting cancer-associated complex carbohydrate chains called glycans with binding proteins, they could penetrate the protective shields of tumor cells and trigger their death without toxicity to surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their biologically engineered immunotherapies—glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR, pronounced 'glitter') compounds, GlyTR1 and GlyTR 2—proved safe and effective in models for a spectrum of cancers, including those of the breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas and prostate, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01032-3" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the holy grail—one treatment to kill virtually all cancers," said Demetriou, a professor of neurology, microbiology and molecular genetics at the UC Irvine School of Medicine and the paper's corresponding author. "GlyTR's velcro-like sugar-binding technology addresses the two major issues limiting current cancer immunotherapies: distinguishing cancer from normal tissue and cancer's ability to suppress the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmark research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's publication, the culmination of a decade of research, is a watershed moment and source of pride for UC Irvine and the UCI Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This landmark study is a paradigm shift with the very real potential to change how we treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;," said Marian Waterman, Ph.D., former deputy director of research at the cancer center and champion of the project since Demetriou, a UCI Health neurologist, began working on the concept in 2015 with his then-postdoctoral fellow, Raymond W. Zhou, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added Richard A. Van Etten, MD, Ph.D., director of the cancer center and an early supporter of the GlyTR project, "This novel technology may, for the first time, allow the widespread application of targeted T-cell therapy to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/solid+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;solid tumors&lt;/a&gt;, which is the 'holy grail' in the immuno-oncology field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chimeric+antigen+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chimeric antigen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (CAR) T therapy, use the body's white blood cells to attack cancer. They have largely worked only for blood cancers, such as leukemia. The GlyTR technology also proved effective in targeting leukemia, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Unorthodox approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many cancer researchers have sought protein biomarkers for specific cancers, Demetriou and Zhou aimed at a more abundant target, the unique coating of glycans that surround cancer cells but are found in very low density in normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complex sugar chains are the most widespread cancer antigens known but were generally ignored by researchers because they are inert to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, Demetriou and Zhou engineered the GlyTR compounds to attach themselves, Velcro-like, to glycan-dense cancer cells while ignoring low-glycan-density normal cells. Once attached, the GlyTR compounds identify the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; as targets for killing by the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, current cancer immunotherapies attack cells based on specific proteins regardless of their glycan density and thereby fail to distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second impediment to developing broadly active cancer immunotherapies is the shield glycans form around solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By targeting glycans and blanketing the tumor cells with the Velcro-like compounds, the GlyTR technology overcomes both obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human trials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing the therapy's safety and effectiveness in humans. Clinical grade GlyTR1 protein manufacturing is already being developed at the NCI Experimental Therapeutics program labs in Maryland, Demetriou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will enable the launch of a phase 1 clinical trial, which could begin within about two years. It will test the therapy in patients with a range of metastatic solid cancers. The highest glycan density is typically seen in patients with refractory/metastatic disease, a population that also has the greatest unmet need for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the revolutionary approach to cancer treatment our patients have been waiting for," said Farshid Dayyani, MD, Ph.D., medical director of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+center/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer center&lt;/a&gt;'s Stern Center for Clinical Trials and Research. "We are committing all available resources to bring this exciting new trial to UCI Health as fast as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

The difference was small but steady, and it held up across many types of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-the-aging-brain"&gt;Studying the aging brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Laura D. Baker, Ph.D., of &lt;a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wake Forest University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.advocatehealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advocate Health&lt;/a&gt;, and her team ran the study across five U.S. sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a large randomized clinical trial with 2,111 adults aged 60 to 79 who were at higher risk for decline due to factors like sedentary behavior, diet, and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were diverse by sex and ethnicity, and retention was high with 89 percent completing the two year visit. Safety was good in both groups, and adherence to the programs was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked global cognition, a combined score from several tests that sample &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, mental speed, and planning. It also looked at executive function, which reflects skills used to plan, switch tasks, and manage goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-aging-and-diet"&gt;Brain, aging, and diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structured program asked people to attend 38 small group meetings over two years and follow a clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals covered aerobic, resistance, and stretching exercise, diet targets, cognitive exercises, social activity, and regular health reviews with a study clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self guided program offered six group check ins and general encouragement, without coaching to specific targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both programs focused on the same core ingredients, they differed in intensity, structure, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet goals followed the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which blends features of Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt; eating patterns with emphasis on greens, berries, whole grains, beans, nuts, olive oil, and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational research has linked MIND style eating to slower cognitive decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mixed when the diet is tested on its own in randomized settings. A recent randomized trial did not find a cognitive benefit over three years, so diet likely works best alongside other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program also used computerized brain exercises. A PLoS Medicine meta &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found modest gains from such training in healthy older adults, and design details like supervision and frequency seemed to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-results-show"&gt;What the results show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two years, the structured group’s global cognition rose by an average of 0.243 standard deviations per year, while the self guided group rose by 0.213. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between groups, 0.029 per year, was statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive function improved more in the structured group by 0.037 standard deviations per year, while processing speed showed a similar pattern that did not reach significance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory scores did not differ between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits were consistent for people across age, sex, ethnicity, heart health, and genetic risk. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APOE ε4&lt;/a&gt; variant, a well known risk factor for Alzheimer disease, did not alter the pattern seen in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-big-is-the-benefit"&gt;How big is the benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 0.029 per year edge sounds tiny, and it is, but it was detectable on careful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; over two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steady gain suggests that structured support may help people keep pace or better, rather than slide as quickly as expected with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengths included high adherence, strong safety, and rigorous measurement. Fewer adverse events were recorded in the structured group despite the extra activity and contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One design limitation matters for interpretation. There was no no-treatment control group, so both programs may have lifted performance in part through education, coaching, and repeated testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-other-research"&gt;How this fits with other research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier Finnish multidomain &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60461-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, known as FINGER, also found that a combined approach to exercise, diet, brain training, and vascular care can help older adults at risk maintain thinking skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. POINTER was designed to test a similar strategy in a broader American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major commission has underscored that many risks for dementia are modifiable across the lifespan. Addressing multiple risks together aligns with that picture and may be more practical than chasing a single fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-aging-and-future-health"&gt;Brain aging and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential to improve cognition with fewer resources and lower participant burden is compelling,” said Baker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support and structure seem to matter, not just the ingredients. The results point to the value of clear goals, regular feedback, and a group that keeps you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The habits themselves are familiar, and that is part of the point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular moderate to vigorous activity, strength work, flexibility, a plant forward eating pattern, social connection, sleep attention, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, glucose, and cholesterol checks can fit into daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single habit is a magic bullet, and not every domain moved in the same way. The absence of a memory difference reminds us that brain health is complex and benefits may show up first in planning and mental speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults with medical conditions should tailor goals with a clinician to stay safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple steps that are repeated and supported are more likely to stick, and this study shows that even modest changes can matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 19:47:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQRGlibXBzYWFkeXV5UWF6RlRPMGNnSVQ0UUlhTlliRG1kZ0p3TUhfeHNWVnpqSGhuX3VDX1R5UDhrOFVOdTNzakU4cVNmNGo4dGR6eGE2TkRCaDdDZTZzbGE5ZXpRODRxS3dyMlRDMlpYTDN1OG1sRXc5YXFENGdINFpOcko4NlN5dzVSU0lsMnhNZjZSZlhnQkJvcmRVTjQ2OWFPUUh2WQ</guid></item><item><title>儿童压力与成年期慢性疾病密切相关，研究人员报告- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-childhood-stress-strongly-linked-chronic.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published by Duke University researchers has found a strong link between higher stress in children and adverse health conditions for them later in life. Appearing in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508549122" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; used measurable metrics of health over time to create a more quantitative view of how stress early in life affects health.&lt;/p&gt;

It gets underneath the skin, and it becomes embodied in the way your body handles stress," said co-author Herman Pontzer, Duke professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/allostatic+load/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;allostatic load&lt;/a&gt; (AL), which refers to the wear and tear on the body because of chronic stress. The researchers "tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health," relying on biomarkers that included antibodies of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation in the body; and the Epstein-Barr virus, which is common and highly contagious; body mass index; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by lead author Elena Hinz, a Ph.D. student in the Pontzer Lab at Duke, showed that a child's stress levels, in children as young as 9 to 11 years old, is an indicator of their cardio and metabolic health in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, researchers ask adults to remember their stress. Hinz and her fellow researchers used a big study that collected quantitative—not just qualitative—samples over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper's authors reviewed data from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS), a longitudinal study of child &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; that began in 1992—and continues today—to determine the need for mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Hinz, who grew up in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rural+community/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rural community&lt;/a&gt; in East Tennessee, said her own coming-of-age experiences spurred her interest in childhood stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm from the rural South and kind of have this idea of what stress looks like in that environment, in terms of childhood adversity and dietary stress and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+environment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical environment&lt;/a&gt; that kids are in," said Hinz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinz said humans combat acute stress through a fight or flight response: "Your body collectively reacts by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure when you are experiencing a stressful situation," she explained. "Those and other responses help you deal with that stress, but it's not good to always be in that state. I'm interested in what happens when that doesn't really subside."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty is at the crux of the study, which indicates a stable, financially secure home is essential for a healthy childhood free of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Children, eight, nine and ten years old—what's happening to them seems to be predictive of blood pressure," said Pontzer about early life stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What helps is education and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/job+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;job training&lt;/a&gt; and all of the stuff that gets communities out of poverty. That gets people the help they need when they need it, as opposed to health care cost barriers. Making sure that a kid knows there's going to be dinner and food on the table because that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychological+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychological stress&lt;/a&gt; isn't just psychological," said Pontzer. "It gets into the way your body works."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, a United Nations declaration is pledging to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York are laying out a new plan for combatting mental health challenges and non-communicable diseases. While their &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/09/25/default-calendar/fourth-high-level-meeting-of-the-un-general-assembly-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-ncds-and-the-promotion-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-(hlm4)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;political declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it also mentions neurological conditions like dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's historical for us. It's a real watershed moment," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about-us/meet-the-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paola Barbarino&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Alzheimer's Disease International, the advocacy group with members in 105 countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She said the inclusion of dementia is particularly significant for lower-income countries, many of which are still in "denial" about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Even in high-income countries where dementia gets attention, like the U.S., it has been a struggle to bring about the behavioral changes and medical interventions — such as weight loss and better blood pressure control — that could delay the onset of the condition. And, for many families dealing with dementia, finding adequate care and support is far from easy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the World Health Organization did put forward a &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/2098e5be-c7f3-4365-aebf-36204459794f/content" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global action plan on dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, which was extended earlier this year, Barbarino says, dementia is often missing or minimized in major policies, frameworks and discussions about non-communicable diseases. For example, WHO's 2022 report &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057661" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Invisible Numbers: The True Extent of Non-communicable Diseases and What To Do About Them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn't mention it. And in 2011 the U.N. did mention Alzheimer's disease in a declaration but did not make specific commitments to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO emailed this statement to NPR on Thursday: "The &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/pga/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/09/Finalized-PD-on-NCDs-and-Mental-Health-REV4-3-September-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; marks a significant milestone by recognizing the global impact of dementia and committing to scale up access to services for the 57 million people living with the condition worldwide." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR caught up with Barbarino — who has spent years as an activist and advocate — while she was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly to talk about the significance of this moment and what comes next. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dementia is one of the biggest health and care challenges of our time. And it's set to grow a lot in prevalence as the population gets older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea, last week, Australia declared dementia to be the leading cause of death. It is already among the biggest causes of death in the U.K., in the Netherlands, in Finland — in a lot more countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So it's actually extraordinary that it wasn't already included [in a U.N. declaration]. But this was not out of spite. It's simply because the stigma around dementia was so fierce that in the 1980s — when there was a movement for the other non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, respiratory disease — nobody was speaking about dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did it take for dementia to be included?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It has been probably two years of very serious work. We knew it was a problem beforehand but only recently did we realize that non-communicable disease mortality data [&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/probability-of-dying-between-exact-ages-30-and-70-from-any-of-cardiovascular-disease-cancer-diabetes-or-chronic-respiratory-(-)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published by the World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; often] focused on people below 70 years of age and not those above 70 years of age. Now, considering people are dying later, we cannot possibly not consider those last 20-some years of [life]. And it's in those 20 years, it's most likely that people will develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So we spent time collecting the data, doing evidence-based research. We published an article in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-024-01051-w#:~:text=Dementia%20is%20a%20neglected%20noncommunicable%20disease%20and%20leading%20cause%20of%20death,-Lewis%20Arthurton%20ORCID&amp;amp;text=Dementia%20is%20largely%20excluded%20from,effects%20are%20set%20to%20increase." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Review Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January. Dementia is expected to be the third leading cause of death globally in 2040. And people have listened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this declaration mean for countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, for high-income countries, a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;risk reduction factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for dementia [like anti-smoking efforts and campaigns to increase physical activity] are the same as those for other major diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. So governments can embrace this agenda a lot more solidly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A lot of low-income countries are still in denial about the fact that dementia is a big problem in their country. That stems from the fact that, in part, they consider themselves young countries, with more young people than old people. They're just not used to thinking about what's going to happen to the older population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often, when our members [in lower-income countries] ask for their government to have risk reduction campaigns, they are told that dementia is not a big condition in the country. Sadly, that [kind of denial] means people living with dementia are not receiving the care and support that they deserve. Same with caregivers. So this is a massive issue that is not going to go away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other thing that is changing is that in low-income countries, just as in high-income countries, there used to be a great reliance on family carers and often older people are now alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What difference can a U.N. declaration make on the ground for families dealing with dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We have reports from all over the world of people in distress, in angst, with massive mental health issues [because they or their family member has dementia]. And it is difficult if you are alone facing this. And if the community around them doesn't know what's happening, they can exclude you rather than include you, and that can become an extra burden. In our survey last year, we found out that a lot of carers — about 33% — stopped doing any social activity after a diagnosis, because they're ashamed and they don't know how to communicate [about dementia].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even at the highest level of government, dementia has so far been excluded. This U.N. declaration, for us, is really important because people now will be able to say: 'No, no. We are a major non- communicable disease.'&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But it's just one step and I am under no illusions. Getting [a dementia action plan] implemented country by country is going to take years — decades, maybe even.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that look like for lower-income countries, especially where health budgets are already tight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;[In some higher-income countries, there are medications on the market that aim to help] but, right now, we are aware that that's not possible [in many lower-income countries].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some countries, the infrastructure and regulatory approval is not there. The testing and diagnostic capacity are not there. Even the medical professionals — the psychiatrist, the neurologist, the geriatricians — are not there. And some of the treatments currently available are very expensive. Some countries can simply not afford them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it's not just medications that matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We were particularly keen for people to understand that you can live a better life if you can have better care. Many families report that once they get a diagnosis, they are left absolutely alone with no information whatsoever. But there can be basic helplines, basic support groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is only so much that civil society can do. This is about the government being conscious of the fact that this is a societal challenge. They have to embrace it just the way they've embraced other conditions, like cancer or heart disease. And ask questions like: How can it be integrated in our health care system? How much money can go towards it?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, as [with] everything that has to do with the U.N. it could remain just as a piece of paper. We need to make sure that there is implementation, that governments put in place public health campaigns that include dementia. We will do a lot of work to make sure that this becomes tangible for the people that live with dementia and for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in vision are often a common sign of aging. But what if we could reverse age-related visual decline? In a new study, UC Irvine researchers explore a possible therapy for addressing "aging" in the eye and for preventing diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;

The study was a collaboration between researchers from UC Irvine, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They outline their findings in "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice," a paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads5769" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the aging gene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is a follow-up to an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-gene-functional-role-aging-eye.html"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt; on Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), an established biomarker of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, also a faculty member at the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that work, the researchers found that enhancing ELOVL2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; in aging mice boosted levels of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more recent study sought to identify a way to bypass the need for the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As we age, changes in lipid metabolism lead to a decline in very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, which in turn affects our vision and can lead to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene is a key enzyme in the production of VLC-PUFAs as well as DHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting aged mice with the polyunsaturated fatty acid improved visual function. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking beyond the retina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-key-enzyme-lipid-metabolism-linked.html"&gt;immune system aging&lt;/a&gt;. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. It also suggested that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lipid+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lipid metabolism&lt;/a&gt; might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vision/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's well known that learning to play an instrument can offer benefits beyond just musical ability. Indeed, research shows it's a great activity for the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00931-2?cc%3Dy&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ISXm9wCpgIU0SZvhTtgIc"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; – it can enhance our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211949322000060&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0J924CbpX-5ltZlm_kS3Ku"&gt;fine motor skills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads7364&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1cQow2kqJZcULW8hCxR7nF"&gt;language acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1603984113&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1IENFgLXtEKL89DqXxVPzu"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2201655119&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw166FJkA0S7pBbFFnX7RsLT"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; – and it can even help to keep our brains &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg7056&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw14ZYapkVsmH9hr5auHz_xJ"&gt;younger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of working with musicians and witnessing how they persist in musical training despite the pain caused by performing thousands of repetitive movements, I started wondering: if musical training can reshape the brain in so many ways, can it also change the way musicians feel pain, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the question that my colleagues and I set out to answer in our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/9900/prior_use_dependent_plasticity_triggers_different.981.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1iOpLUyMOVJL8e-aUAhFRx"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells-repair-brain-damage-caused-by-stroke-in-mice"&gt;Stem Cells Repair Brain Damage Caused by Stroke in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already know that pain activates several reactions in our bodies and brains, changing our &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590018306825&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1jaku2saW7RGkpVnd0VlTd"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/fulltext/2001/03000/pain_related_catastrophizing__what_is_it_.9.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3JNKyefXS4HwgSlWrTVnXn"&gt;thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as our way of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2eiv19D0l09QeV2obB-ESP"&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; and behaving. If you touch a hot pan, for example, pain makes you pull back your hand before you get seriously burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain also changes our brain activity. Indeed, pain usually reduces activity in &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590022003273&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3-56lqYYYUe4c4qbZeVN8X"&gt;the motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;, the area of the brain that controls muscles, which helps stop you from overusing an injured body part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reactions help to prevent further harm when you're injured. In this way, pain is a protective signal that helps us in the short term. But if pain continues for a longer time and your brain keeps sending these &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08ZXf5flpsMKxy23c3_ZA3"&gt;"don't move"&lt;/a&gt; signals for too long, things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you sprain your ankle and stop using it for weeks, it can reduce your mobility and disrupt the brain activity in regions related to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/painrpts/fulltext/2017/06000/the_impact_of_pain_related_fear_on_neural_pathways.8.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZNUxJblLM5UXSgeZMS53k"&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt;. And this can increase your &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154618300640&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08ZXf5flpsMKxy23c3_ZA3"&gt;suffering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1529943020300462&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0M99m4LJNtgPUHaTm8mLyU"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; levels in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also found that persistent pain can &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590019307448&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1g6bxlJt3m8U6unlkBPSvc"&gt;shrink&lt;/a&gt; what's known as our brain's "body map" – this is where our brain sends commands for which muscles to move and when – and this shrinking is linked with worse pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while it's clear that some people experience more pain when their brain maps shrink, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2829261&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1WneUxjBR0TcQvk8vCPrU8"&gt;not everyone is affected the same way&lt;/a&gt;. Some people can better handle pain, and their brains are less sensitive to it. Scientists still don't fully understand why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175452" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument.jpg" alt="Hands playing a piano" class="size-full wp-image-175452" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Pianist-Playing-Piano-Keyboard-Instrument-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175452" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Learning to play an instrument can offer benefits beyond just musical ability. (TrueCreatives/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Musicians and pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, we wanted to look at whether musical training and all the brain changes it creates could influence how musicians feel and deal with pain. To do this, we deliberately induced hand pain over several days in both musicians and non-musicians to see if there was any difference in how they responded to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To safely mimic muscle pain, we used a compound called &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-008-1531-5&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0FgOCypdpQ7UldT_lSPvAH"&gt;nerve growth factor&lt;/a&gt;. It's a protein that normally keeps nerves healthy, but when injected into hand muscles, it makes them ache for several days, especially if you're moving your hand. But it's safe, temporary, and doesn't cause any damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we used a technique called &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneurophys/fulltext/2002/08000/basic_mechanisms_of_tms.6.aspx?casa_token%3DkndoZ2oPufEAAAAA:mu53jpmgWrbukvlluTW9Wg0ORqjMXMso9M1c_deQ6WXkxG1eVc9GZIwAnYJDyAJDLxK5wF4m0m7zH-yan31RIA&amp;amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;amp;ust=1758884988000000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2P3ZQOOdv3R6gBOuAhslRy"&gt;transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (TMS) to measure brain activity. TMS sends tiny magnetic pulses into the brain. And we used these signals to create a map of how the brain controls the hand, which we did for each person who took part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built these hand maps before the pain injection, and then measured them again two days later and eight days later, to see if pain changed how the brain was working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we compared the brains of the musicians and the non-musicians, the differences were striking. Even before we induced pain, the musicians showed a more finely tuned hand map in the brain, and the more hours they had spent practising, the more refined this map was found to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pain was induced, the musicians reported experiencing less discomfort overall. And while the hand map in non-musicians' brains shrank after just two days of pain, the maps in musicians' brains remained unchanged – amazingly, the more hours they had trained, the less pain they felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175456" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter.jpg" alt="Close up on man's open mouth" class="size-full wp-image-175456" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ManWithFacialExpressionOfPainOrLaughter-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175456" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The differences between the brains of musicians and non-musicians were striking.

Their training seems to have given them a kind of buffer against the usual negative effects, both in how much pain they felt and in how their brain's motor areas reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn't mean music is a cure for chronic pain. But it does show us that long-term training and experience can shape how we perceive pain. This is exciting because it might help us understand why some people are more resilient to pain than others, along with how we can design new treatments for those living with pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-brain-system-that-repairs-your-body-while-you-sleep"&gt;Study Reveals Brain System That Repairs Your Body While You Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team is now conducting further research on pain to determine if musical training may also protect us from altered attention and cognition during chronic pain. And off the back of this, we hope to be able to design new therapies that "retrain" the brain in people who suffer from persistent pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the most exciting part: the idea that as a musician, what I learn and practise every day doesn't just make me better at a skill, but that it can literally rewire my brain in ways that change how I experience the world, even something as fundamental as pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was commissioned by &lt;a href="https://videnskab.dk/"&gt;Videnskab.dk&lt;/a&gt; as part of a partnership collaboration with The Conversation.

    &lt;p&gt;When Maria Branyas Morera &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-branyas-morera-worlds-oldest-living-person-spain-dies-117/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives," Esteller said. "And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas "had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before," Esteller said. She also had "very good habits." She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt — eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans," Esteller added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study noted that "whether the dominance of the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas once &lt;a href="https://x.com/MariaBranyas112/status/1601512836932390914/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; about her love for yogurt, saying it "gives life" — and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one — free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges from studying Branyas "shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," the study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that to conduct the study, "samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity "are probably highly individualized processes," so "drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution." &lt;/p&gt;

The condition is typically asymptomatic, and people may live with it for years without knowing, until it turns into full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with prediabetes, doctors recommend foods that cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar rather than a rapid spike, including whole, unprocessed foods over packaged and sugary items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study is turning that advice on its head, with scientists concluding that high-sugar fruits may actually be the key to reversing prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tropical fruits contain between 10 to 50 grams of sugar, making them foods that people concerned about blood glucose &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584073/artificial-ingredients-food-drinks-organ-working-properly.html"&gt;try to avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But clinical nutrition researcher Raedeh Basiri said that mangos, despite having high levels of natural sugar, may offer protective factors for adults with prediabetes. People in the latest study who ate a daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mango also contains a wealth of vitamins, including A, C, B6 and E, plus key minerals like potassium and copper and more than five grams of fiber, a key nutrient that slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This prevents rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can, over time, cause type 2 diabetes, suffered by 37million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sugar content is not the only factor in picking the right foods. Fiber and vitamin content &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775847/Doctors-plant-diet-heart-disease-Type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;are just as important&lt;/a&gt;, and Basiri said in a statement: ‘Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Though tropical fruits are often avoided for their sugar, researcher Raedeh Basiri suggests mangoes could have protective factors for those with prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant signs that health was improving were observed in people in the mango group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their fasting blood glucose levels decreased, while the control group's levels increased, resulting in the mango group showing a clinically significant 18.3 mg/dL improvement by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mango group's fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's increased to 125.3 mg/dL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal range for fasting blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The marker for long-term blood sugar regulation in the mango remained stable but rose in the control group, proving that a daily mango exerted a protective effect against worsening blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits also extended to people’s body composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who ate mangoes showed decreased body fat percentage from about 31 percent to 29 percent, a relative reduction of nearly five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, the group that ate mangoes experienced a significant increase in fat-free mass, which is vital for a healthy metabolism, because muscle is a primary site for the disposal of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After 24 weeks, the mango group's (blue) fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's (orange) level increased to 125.3 mg/dL, a clinically significant difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows changes in people's waist-hip ratio at the start of the study and over the course of 24 weeks. The group consuming mango (blue) daily saw a significant decrease in their waist-to-hip ratio, a key indicator of health risk. In contrast, the control group (orange) experienced a significant increase in their ratio over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group showed no significant improvements in either marker, suggesting that incorporating a daily mango can be a practical dietary strategy for enhancing metabolic health and body composition in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/17/2971"&gt;Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri said: ‘It is not just the sugar content that matters, but the overall food context that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The goal is to encourage people to include whole fruits, like mango, as part of healthy eating behaviors and practical dietary strategies for diabetes prevention.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing prediabetes primarily involves adopting sustainable lifestyle habits that improve how your body uses insulin and manages blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key strategies include focusing on a balanced diet rich in fiber from vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting processed foods and sugary drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity is crucial. Experts say aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, per week to help muscles use glucose more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, getting adequate sleep and managing stress levels are key for preserving metabolic health and significantly reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQWDhCaks2X2FsNTQxQWpUamFKVmY4S3BJVXBxQ3BKWnV5cWcwNGJzdUY0cWNjNkpNM1loSmdEUHc5RWN3Z1VWMzJIME1iSEZkWWhnSTZwbHE2M1Jza0xSZTg0RmxzVWxlVTFxZHJfUmhxWGIyYTNCeGswXy11MmVjSEo4RmNubjAyTVZySnBDcnVveVQwbWRwd29SekhoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOLTNBRDdMTHZGOXRPWjFZSVJ3ZnFOOVNTOGdBZ3pTT3p6M3hZd1lOVy1qTENXZUIyalVad2doVEF1R3BfLTQ3aXZsaTEtSGt3ai1zMjBiNS1XMkZvVENnWG5JTnlrbU82YlVfLTVlelo2TDg5c1M2WFRtSXA2NDdUbElWMHI4MnpwMlNOWm9UYWY3WE5pd3pCUFQyWXFvSTJ0R0Fz</guid></item><item><title>逆转糖尿病的2 $水果...... 1亿美国人患有致命疾病，大多数人都不知道-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15133407/fruit-reverse-diabetes-mango-sugar-fiber.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists are offering people with a condition marked by blood sugar control counterintuitive advice that could actually halt a deadly disease progress in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 96 million adults and 8 million kids in America are living with prediabetes, a prelude to type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-52d87820-9a1e-11f0-8ab3-932b928d798f"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15133407" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15133407/fruit-reverse-diabetes-mango-sugar-fiber.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant signs that health was improving were observed in people in the mango group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their fasting blood glucose levels decreased, while the control group's levels increased, resulting in the mango group showing a clinically significant 18.3 mg/dL improvement by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mango group's fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's increased to 125.3 mg/dL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal range for fasting blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The marker for long-term blood sugar regulation in the mango remained stable but rose in the control group, proving that a daily mango exerted a protective effect against worsening blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits also extended to people’s body composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who ate mangoes showed decreased body fat percentage from about 31 percent to 29 percent, a relative reduction of nearly five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, the group that ate mangoes experienced a significant increase in fat-free mass, which is vital for a healthy metabolism, because muscle is a primary site for the disposal of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After 24 weeks, the mango group's (blue) fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's (orange) level increased to 125.3 mg/dL, a clinically significant difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows changes in people's waist-hip ratio at the start of the study and over the course of 24 weeks. The group consuming mango (blue) daily saw a significant decrease in their waist-to-hip ratio, a key indicator of health risk. In contrast, the control group (orange) experienced a significant increase in their ratio over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group showed no significant improvements in either marker, suggesting that incorporating a daily mango can be a practical dietary strategy for enhancing metabolic health and body composition in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/17/2971"&gt;Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri said: ‘It is not just the sugar content that matters, but the overall food context that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The goal is to encourage people to include whole fruits, like mango, as part of healthy eating behaviors and practical dietary strategies for diabetes prevention.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing prediabetes primarily involves adopting sustainable lifestyle habits that improve how your body uses insulin and manages blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key strategies include focusing on a balanced diet rich in fiber from vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting processed foods and sugary drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity is crucial. Experts say aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, per week to help muscles use glucose more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, getting adequate sleep and managing stress levels are key for preserving metabolic health and significantly reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQWDhCaks2X2FsNTQxQWpUamFKVmY4S3BJVXBxQ3BKWnV5cWcwNGJzdUY0cWNjNkpNM1loSmdEUHc5RWN3Z1VWMzJIME1iSEZkWWhnSTZwbHE2M1Jza0xSZTg0RmxzVWxlVTFxZHJfUmhxWGIyYTNCeGswXy11MmVjSEo4RmNubjAyTVZySnBDcnVveVQwbWRwd29SekhoQQ</guid></item><item><title>研究解释了常见2型糖尿病药物疗效的丧失- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-loss-efficacy-common-diabetes-drug.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes medications, such as sulfonylureas, have been a mainstay of treating the disease since they came on the market in the early 1950s. However, although they are one of the most common drugs for this condition, it is not surprising that they lose effectiveness over time and have been seen to often cause more side effects than other antidiabetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A new study led by IDIBELL, the University of Barcelona, the Bellvitge University Hospital and the Center for Biomedical Research in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM), recently &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16632" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, has delved into this problem, confirming that drugs in the sulfonylurea family can cause a loss of identity of insulin-producing cells, reducing their ability to secrete the hormone and possibly accelerating the progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The gears of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a chronic condition caused by an abnormal increase in blood glucose (hyperglycemia). It is a complex disease with various biological actors involved, but its main protagonists are insulin and pancreatic beta (β) cells: insulin is the hormone that allows blood glucose levels to be regulated, facilitating the exit of glucose from the bloodstream and its consequent entry into the cells so that they can be nourished; and β cells are precisely the ones responsible for producing insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In type 2 diabetes, the problem lies in the appearance of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and a progressive loss of function of the cells β that try to cope with it. The resistance of peripheral tissues to the effect of insulin forces β cells to produce more insulin and, over time, this overexertion leads to the loss of functional mass of β cells. Without them, insulin production drops and blood glucose levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Beta cells don't just die, they also change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the death of β cells was considered the main cause of the loss of functional cell mass in type 2 diabetes, but recently it has been seen that the loss of identity of these cells also plays an important role. It was known that this happened in mouse models, but now researchers corroborate it in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cells β not only die but also lose their functional identity and, although they are still alive, they revert to a state in which they are unable to produce and secrete insulin effectively," explains Dr. Eduard Montanya, leader of the Diabetes, nutrition and endocrine diseases group at IDIBELL, physician at the Bellvitge Hospital, researcher at CIBER and professor at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the UB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And it appears that sulfonylureas contribute to this loss of cell identity, increasing and enhancing their loss of function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The double face of sulfonylureas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonylureas are drugs capable of interacting directly with β cells to stimulate insulin secretion. Initially, they are effective in lowering blood glucose levels, but eventually lose the ability to restore glycemic control (which is known as secondary sulfonylurea failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, as seen by the researchers, continued exposure to these drugs contributes to the loss of β cell function. This would explain why they are progressively less effective in reducing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, which could accelerate the progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how this happens, Dr. Montanya's team has analyzed the effect of glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea, on healthy pancreatic β cells exposed to normal glucose conditions. The results are clear: cells exposed to the drug showed a reduction in the expression of genes essential to their function (including insulin expression itself), increased rate of cell death, and lose of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;-secretion capacity in response to glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have been able to confirm that glibenclamide has negative effects on β cells and accelerates the loss of functional mass, and that it does so in a time-dependent manner, since the involvement is greater the longer the exposure time," the researchers emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has shown that the mechanism by which sulfonylureas cause the loss of identity of beta cells is, at least partially, through the induction of stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular structure involved in the manufacture and modification of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Loss of identity, a potentially reversible phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these results provide a basis for understanding the loss of efficacy of sulfonylureas in the treatment of diabetes and their potential contribution to the progression of the disease, although more studies are needed to see how this finding translates into clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the other hand, knowing that in type 2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; some beta cells do not die, but revert to a non-functional state, opens a line of research of great clinical interest: unlike cell death, the loss of identity is a potentially reversible phenomenon. Thus, understanding how it is produced is key to proposing, in the future, possible therapies that reverse the process and recover the functional identity of cells to offer long-term solutions for diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusl6000l3b79wqpkznjl@published"&gt;My parents were scheduled to take the kids on Saturday morning and have them back by dinnertime while Mia and I attended the bar mitzvah of a friend’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzq5g35001j3b79uqa0bppv@published"&gt;When we got back in the late afternoon, we received a text with pics of my parents and our kids at a famous aquarium—one that is a plane-ride away from our home! Apparently my parents decided to surprise the boys. They had the trip in the works since we asked them to watch the boys—&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; clearing it with my wife and me.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusmz000m3b79t2q589y5@published"&gt;Once we saw the pictures, Mia called them, incensed, and demanded they return with the kids immediately. My parents said they’d be back Sunday evening, and then pretended their battery was dying and ended the call. We didn’t hear from them again until they were ready to board the plane the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpx7sq000z3b79n01f5c2k@published"&gt;Mia has been beyond furious and is adamant that my parents lose all access to the boys. While I realize my parents should have consulted us about going on the trip with the kids, I really think this is an overreaction. The kids had the time of their lives. Neither of them have any medical issues that would preclude a spur of the moment trip, and my parents are two caring, responsible adults. How can I convince my wife that going nuclear is not the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuszf000o3b793pobr2m1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Furor, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzput1g000p3b799p9oykp9@published"&gt;I mean, first I wouldn’t accuse her of “going nuclear”? I get why she’s mad, and also why whatever faith she might have had in your parents has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputck000q3b79qv4xuql5@published"&gt;Let’s review the facts: Your parents took your children on a flight and an overnight trip without your knowledge or consent. And then, when they were told to bring the kids back that same day, they refused, made up a lie about their phone battery, and presumably didn’t contact or take any further calls from you, &lt;em&gt;your children’s parents&lt;/em&gt;, until they were about to fly home the next day. To top it off, it sounds like they have not apologized and don’t believe they did anything wrong…which means they would probably feel justified in doing something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputf0000r3b79mta1lg04@published"&gt;Some people would say there’s a word for taking someone else’s children from home without their parents’ knowledge or permission, and then refusing to bring them back when they were told to! Of course I’m not saying that your parents had malicious intentions, or that your kids were ever in danger. Nor am I saying they need to be cut off forever. But when you kind of dismiss your wife’s anger by saying that your children had fun—I mean, that’s nice, I guess, but the amount of fun had by anyone is not even remotely the point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputo2000s3b79fr7klama@published"&gt;This incident has shown that you and your wife cannot trust your parents to 1) go through the (required and extremely basic!) process of informing you of what they plan to do with your &lt;em&gt;minor children &lt;/em&gt;and getting your permission to do things like keep them overnight or bring them on a flight somewhere, or 2) listen and actually do what you ask where your children are concerned. I see how those things would be dealbreakers for some, especially if this wasn’t a one-time thing, but just the latest and wildest way your parents have shown their disrespect for you, your wife, and your authority as parents. And it sounds like this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; part of a larger pattern—you said yourself that your parents have a history of not respecting the boundaries you and Mia put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputr5000t3b797ksgjtpa@published"&gt;(I have just reread your letter and noted that your parents &lt;em&gt;were planning this all along&lt;/em&gt; and chose not to read you in. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fun, spontaneous decision they made without telling you, which still would have been weird; they made their plan, bought the tickets, reserved a hotel, and then chose to deceive you about it every moment leading up to the trip. ABSOLUTELY WILD BEHAVIOR. Like, did they &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;think this was normal? I’m actually kind of worried about them, if so.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu4g000u3b79m7mbbd9b@published"&gt;Maybe your wife is saying that she doesn’t want your parents to have access to your kids because she really doesn’t feel like she can currently trust them. If you and Mia tell them to do X or don’t do Y with the kids, Mia doesn’t know whether they’ll listen. Maybe she’s really pissed and just doesn’t want to see them for a good long while—honestly, that makes sense to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu8m000v3b79v6e3jk25@published"&gt;Instead of telling your wife that she’s overreacting, or trying to talk her out of how she feels, listen to what she’s saying and try to understand where she’s coming from. Acknowledge that what your parents did was unacceptable, and that Mia has a right to be upset. After that, perhaps the two of you can eventually get to a point where you can discuss ways your parents might see the kids, under conditions you both can live with (e.g.: visits at your house with at least one parent present, after a break/cooldown period, if your parents promise that nothing like this will never happen again?). Mia might really need some time before she can consider this, or see your parents herself, so try to respect that. The point is that it shouldn’t be you against your wife, or you and your parents against your wife. It should be you and Mia acknowledging what your parents did wrong, acknowledging the other person’s feelings, and trying to problem-solve together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuuh2000w3b79conm21yc@published"&gt;Finally, I will add that, whether or not your parents see the kids any time soon, it seems super clear that they shouldn’t be left alone in charge of them again. If you can’t even trust them to do what you ask regarding your kids or run things like &lt;em&gt;plane trips&lt;/em&gt; by you first, they can’t be your go-to caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfznjft3000l8mm6873zkixv@published"&gt;My daughter, an eighth-grader, is a doodler. She doodles while thinking, doodles while writing, doodles while doing homework. So when she turns in, say, her math, in addition to the various correct and incorrect answers, the sheet of paper often features medieval illuminations and little anime characters in the margins. I think it helps her think and stay focused on her work. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/10/ask-a-teacher-doodling-and-distraction-in-the-classroom.html"&gt;One of her teachers, however, keeps writing YOUR HOMEWORK IS NOT A DOODLE PAD and threatening to take away points.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During the 2024-25 flu season, 109 children were diagnosed with the rare complication, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/" target="_blank"&gt;new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fe378" class="body-graf"&gt;The finding comes as the nation logged &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-37.html" target="_blank"&gt;280 pediatric flu deaths last year&lt;/a&gt;, the deadliest ever aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic, as well as falling rates of children vaccinated against influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f39b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t always know how to predict which kids are going to have the most severe forms of flu, which is why we recommend the vaccine for everyone,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “It's a misnomer to think that only sickly kids get complications from the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42e698" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE is rare — just a handful of cases each year — and has never been formally tracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e9697" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, however, doctors anecdotally noted an uptick in kids severely affected with brain inflammation after having the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-741fb3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t know in real numbers if this is an increase, but I will tell you, being on the ground, being a physician who cares for these patients, I was certainly struck that this was an increase,” said Dr. Molly Wilson-Murphy, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. She is also an author of the new study published by the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-dea652" class="body-heading"&gt;Dangerous complications from the flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93ffcb" class="body-graf"&gt;The 109 children tallied in the research were all diagnosed with influenza-associated encephalopathy, or IAE. It occurs when the influenza virus attacks the child’s nervous system. Kids can have a spectrum of symptoms: confusion, difficulty walking, hallucinations, abnormal movements and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e00b0" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilson-Murphy suspects there are at least seven forms of IAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d88c64" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE, Beckett’s illness, is one of them. ANE accounted for about a third of the overall IAE cases in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc51b" class="body-graf"&gt;Of the children with influenza-associated encephalopathy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-e8ca04" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;74% were admitted to the intensive care unit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;54% were put on a ventilator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% were previously healthy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19% died&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5caad4" class="body-graf"&gt;“Flu is dangerous for children, period,” said Dr. Keith Van Haren, a co-author of the study and a pediatric neurologist at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California. “That is not a mischaracterization.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3bb699" class="body-heading"&gt;Childhood flu vaccine rates are falling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec7bd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Seasonal flu shots are notoriously subpar when it comes to preventing flu infections, compared with more robust vaccines like the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbe579" class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors say the shot’s benefit lies in its ability to reduce the chance the infection will lead to severe complications and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bf40" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our goal as parents and doctors is to keep kids healthy and to help protect kids who are at risk from getting sicker,” Van Haren said. “Vaccination against the flu is the purest, best, simplest way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-386e26" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, the flu shot was found to be up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;78% effective&lt;/a&gt; in keeping kids and teens with the flu out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01f7af" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the new report, 84% of kids with influenza-associated encephalopathy whose vaccination status was known weren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ded252" class="body-graf"&gt;And 90% of the 280 children who died last flu season hadn’t received their annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-579a03" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best way to protect yourself and your family from influenza is for everyone to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9b60" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians generally recommend kids get their flu shots before the end of October. A peek at how the shot has been working so far in the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season shows the vaccine is cutting down on flu-related hospitalizations by half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7c5b1" class="body-graf"&gt;But the percentage of kids getting their flu shots has been falling in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f76663" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the CDC, fewer than half of kids (49.2%) had their flu shot last year, down from 62.4% in the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44beda" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Leary said that reasons for the decline are complex. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;Increasing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is just one factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5465e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of families are experiencing access to care issues,” he said. “And a lot of practices are experiencing significant staffing issues. They might not be able to have large flu clinics after hours or on  Saturdays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccb0f5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;With rare exceptions, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQX1hjNXp1MEpGUlM5Z2p0eEh5Zm5jM3Vpa1BidGpGZHkwdzRwMHVIam91UlU5bzRUVU9lenhwdVhZckpEMmhhTHJ4TExBRS05bXhqZjdvMlpfcVFTbFRoVVNvSlQyQ0NVN21wTURRcEl1OWZnXzc5ejlHN0dBNnc4TjhwSnI4T1JFcDYzV3d1bzIwTHRHTGl3Nkgwb0dFXzZF0gFWQVVfeXFMUEhQWnlSTHhyVXpRMmt4Q2pOWGZjeW5fQ1ZGODYwclRDUzhEbW9vMHAtdWJSZWduX2Jhd0dGUTV1QzBrdGptZURRc3lzb1EwQkJuNkZJbEE</guid></item><item><title>电子烟对牙齿和口腔健康有什么影响？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/25/impact-vaping-teeth-oral-health-decay</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QAndAExplainerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-smoking-bad-for-teeth" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is smoking bad for teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A hefty proportion of vapers are former smokers or smoke as well as vape, so the first port of call is the impact of smoking. Humans started smoking long before modern science and there is a wealth of robust evidence on its health effects. The message is clear: smoking is extremely damaging to oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the bad breath, brown stains and loss of taste, tar and toxins in tobacco smoke increase the risk of gum disease. In severe cases, this can cause teeth to fall out. The disease can be harder to spot in smokers though, because nicotine reduces blood flow in the gums. This makes them less likely to bleed, which is one of the early warning signs of disease. Smokers may also struggle to overcome gum disease because of the continued onslaught of smoke and the effect smoking has on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer throughout the body and more than half of mouth cancers are linked to the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-vaping" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about vaping?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The impact of vaping on teeth and oral health is still being thrashed out. Far fewer studies have looked at the issue and many that have are flawed. A common problem is that studies fail to ensure vapers are not smoking cigarettes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The absolute effects of vapes and their impact on oral health are unknown,” a spokesperson for the British Dental Association said. But they added that recent, limited evidence did raise concerns over oral dryness, irritation and gum disease caused by vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-studies-say" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What do the studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at Newcastle University published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41432-025-01119-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;major review&lt;/a&gt; this year into the impact of vaping on periodontal health, meaning the gums, ligaments and bone that supports our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two markers of long-term disease are bone loss and pockets in the gum tissue around teeth, but there was no evidence these were any worse in vapers than in non-smokers or former smokers. The vapers did have slightly worse gum disease, “but it was pretty marginal”, said Dr Richard Holliday, a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Again, the evidence is tentative, but there are some concerns. In &lt;a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177%2822%2900577-3/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers analysed patient records for more than 13,000 people who attended dental clinics between 2019 and 2022. “Patients who vaped did show an increased risk of developing dental caries when compared to non-smoking and non-vaping patients,” Dr Karina Irusa, the study’s first author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Newcastle team also found higher levels of plaque in vapers compared with non-smokers or former smokers, which would be in keeping with a greater risk of dental caries. But more studies are needed to investigate whether vaping itself is to blame for tooth decay. There’s evidence that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5269575/#:~:text=Nicotine%20dependence%20was%20positively%20correlated,context%20of%20depression%20and%20stress." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nicotine users eat more sugar&lt;/a&gt;, so vapers may have bad teeth for reasons other than their nicotine habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-might-vaping-cause-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How might vaping cause tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A common claim is that sugar in flavoured vapes drives tooth decay, but manufacturers tend to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. This is because sugar burns at vape-operating temperatures, so using them would produce a burnt flavour and clog up the heating coil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If vaping does drive tooth decay, Holliday suspects that having a dry mouth, which vapers often mention, is part of the problem. “Saliva is a wonderful thing to protect your teeth. When you reduce that, tooth decay can happen more rapidly and gum disease can happen more rapidly, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saliva helps to keep teeth clean and it also contains calcium and phosphate that help withstand acid attacks from bacteria, and from drinks such as fruit juices, which are the key drivers of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How vapes cause a dry mouth isn’t entirely clear, but vape liquids are the prime culprits. They are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol, which are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb and hold on to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-cancer" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who vape do not inhale anything like the number and variety of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. For this reason, the risk appears low. But it is an area scientists are watching, because vapers are still regularly inhaling chemicals into their bodies and the long-term effects on the delicate tissue in the lungs and elsewhere are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-vaping-safe-for-young-people" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is vaping safe for young people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, summed it up like this: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.” According to Holliday, that is sound advice. “If you’re a young person, don’t vape,” he said. “You are putting something into a complicated ecosystem, so there will be risks from vaping long term. But compared to smoking, they’ll be minuscule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOb1NSUWp3SDUwQlNuTUF4bDZDTWphM0JvOHBPaTY5LXNiUkszQVdiTnI5YUZjTkFOdHFUX0cxazl1R1JpSDZ0cVpUU3VJNXB4NGlJR3ZJQXU1TTBqZ2RnNmsxbUFOai1tLWtqd1Qyc01CbnlLR2lQTEJVYXYzT1B3eVhaT0Y3X1pvWWtxcmR3</guid></item><item><title>刚果新爆发的埃博拉疫情导致数十人死亡，因为卫生官员警告缺乏资金-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-who-funding-usaid-8aac166927249acf58a75abe859f56a2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;GOMA, Congo (AP) — As a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;deadly new Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kills dozens in southern Congo, health authorities and organizations are sounding the alarm, warning they lack the funds and resources to mount an effective response to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said Wednesday that 57 cases and 35 deaths have been reported since the outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 4. The fatality rate is over 61%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation’s capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,” said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16"&gt;U.S. funding cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo’s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-agency-for-international-development"&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFRC’s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of USAID, Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, said that the U.S. government has provided “some small support,” though he could not provide specific details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that the organization’s only current funding for the outbreak response is a $2 million emergency fund and around $2.3 million from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gavi-alliance-vaccines-us-funding-3123781dd776b0019d4f869789e2715e"&gt;Gavi vaccine alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is far below the WHO’s projected cost of around $20 million to respond to the outbreak over the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities,” Jasarevic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congolese authorities’ current national response plan is estimated at $78 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating Ebola demands “enormous resources,” even for a single patient, said Jean Paul Mbantshi, the chief medical officer of the Bulape health zone. He said the zone desperately needs ambulances to transport patients from remote areas to the hospital before they become highly contagious. Health workers also require more protective equipment, medicine, and additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“All this costs money, we need more support,” Mbantshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, just 1,740 people in three health zones of Kasai province — Bulape, Bulambae and Mweka — have been vaccinated as of Sept. 21. The Bulape zone alone has a population of more than 212,000, according to 2020 figures from the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO said the vaccination campaign has not been implemented as fast as desired because of logistical challenges. A lack of storage infrastructure in Bulape, for instance, has forced officials to transport vaccines in small batches, causing delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amitié Bukidi, chief medical officer of the Mweka health zone, said the response is still in the early stages, with the majority of cases occurring outside of health centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to expand our community outreach, especially by raising awareness among opinion leaders, to reach farmers who are hardest to reach,” Bukidi said, adding that his team needs motorcycles to reach remote, hard to access areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“The need is still very great,” he said. “If USAID were to be involved, that would be good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banchereau reported from Dakar, Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A deadly repeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year by year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then often progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antisense therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Nobel Prize last year&lt;/a&gt;, although the technology &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;has yet to yield any approved medicines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed adults, many with chronic pain, and found that optimism, restorative sleep, social connections, and stress management strongly protected against accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans revealed that participants with the most protective factors had brains up to eight years younger than expected. These results suggest that lifestyle habits can measurably slow brain aging and strengthen resilience even in vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Age Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure comparing MRI-based “brain age” to real age shows lifestyle impacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep, optimism, stress management, and social support slowed brain aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Brains looked up to 8 years younger in participants with healthy habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;University of Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;strong&gt;our chronological age may say 65, but your brain could be acting a decade younger — or older — depending on your  life experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from a new study by University of Florida researchers, who found that optimism, good sleep, social support and other positive factors were strongly linked with healthier brains. The findings suggest that how people live and cope with stress can measurably influence the pace of brain aging, even in those living with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are things that people have some level of control over,” said Jared Tanner, Ph.D., a research associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida who helped lead the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can learn how to perceive stress differently. Poor sleep is very treatable. Optimism can be practiced.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research followed 128 middle-aged and older adults, most with chronic musculoskeletal pain associated with or at risk of knee osteoarthritis, for two years. Using MRI scans analyzed by a machine learning system, the team estimated each participant’s “brain age” and compared it to their actual chronological age. This brain age gap between the two served as a measure of whole-brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressful factors like chronic pain, low income, less education and other social risks were associated with older-looking brains. Those links seemed to make less of an impression over time. What stood out more clearly were protective elements: things like getting restorative sleep, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding tobacco and having supportive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported the most protective factors had brains eight years younger than their chronological age when the study started, and their brains went on to age more slowly over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The message is consistent across our studies,  health promoting behaviors are not only associated with lower pain and better physical functioning, they appear to actually bolster health in an additive fashion at a meaningful level,” said Kimberly Sibille, Ph.D., an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UF and senior author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibille and Tanner, along with colleagues across UF and at other institutions, published their findings Sept. 11 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that older brains are more vulnerable to problems like memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Traditionally, brain research has focused on individual regions. But since pain, stress and life experiences affect many parts of the brain at once, the brain age gap — the difference between a person’s age and how old their brain looks in brain scans — provides a single, whole-brain snapshot that captures those complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study focused on people living with chronic pain, it’s likely that factors like lower stress, social support and quality sleep serve to slow brain aging in other populations as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Literally for every additional healthy promoting factor there is some evidence of neurobiological benefit,” Sibille said. “Our findings support the growing body of evidence that Lifestyle is medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2e39222865232a2622273f24250b3e2d27652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ufl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Hamilton – University of Florida&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/a&gt;” by Jared Tanner et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay between chronic musculoskeletal pain and brain aging is complex. Studies employing machine learning models to assess relationships between brain age and chronic pain generally show higher chronic pain severity associates with older brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses to date have not considered individual and community level socioenvironmental risk factors or behavioral/psychosocial protective factors as potential modifiers of cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age. This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between chronic pain, socioenvironmental risk, behavioral/psychosocial protective factors, and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample comprised 197 adults (Men:Women = 68:129) from a prospective observational cohort study. Most individuals reported knee pain and were with/at risk for osteoarthritis. A subset of 128 participants (Men:Women = 41:87) completed a follow-up MRI session at two years and were included in the longitudinal analysis (Aim 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 45–85 years of age and self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White. Data collected included demographics, health history, pain assessments, individual and community-level socioenvironmental factors (education, income, household size, marital and insurance status, and area deprivation index) coded as a summative socioenvironmental risk variable, and behavioral/psychosocial factors (tobacco use, waist circumference, optimism, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, perceived social support, sleep) coded as a summative behavioral/psychosocial protective factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI data was used to estimate brain age applying a machine learning approach (DeepBrainNet). Cross-sectional analyses utilized regression and analysis of variance, while longitudinal analyses utilized a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk associated with an increased brain age gap (the difference between chronological age and predicted brain age). Participants who had higher socioenvironmental risk had brains that were about three years older than participants with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more behavioral/psychosocial protective factors correlated with a lower brain age gap; participants with higher behavioral/psychosocial protective factors had brains that were over three years younger than participants with fewer behavioral/psychosocial protective factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinally, higher baseline behavioral/psychosocial protective factors associated with lower brain age over the two-year span, beyond the effects of chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show behavioral/psychosocial protective factors may counteract neurobiological aging and help buffer the brain from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:18:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBuNkgxdVFSaWlfUHJORjNpTzcwQjl4a2thc0wzTDQ2QkFGZGxUX25jSkhtQjMxX0lnai1MQ1pYWWt5NlV2SW82TmxhbVRYTUQ4LUhnNi0wZnRGY1ZpdkdqTGNiZkJUZGM0</guid></item><item><title>疫苗接种和遗忘的代价-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/0feb1f55-4644-4ecb-9ea8-cab185413df7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT newspaper delivered Monday-Saturday, plus FT Digital Edition delivered to your device Monday-Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5WZ1o5cUxFQXM2RV91Nm8yV1Q4UEl2LXRsQXJGZnV6alNZdDR5NTdQLXhoWXpWaThQS2pmWUY3Y3V6Q1lURVM2RzBOYjdaTGFDNVlIVmNqYWxFVDR3dmtobXhWYzlrNk5panAxVzJ2bmQ</guid></item><item><title>如何通过更换包装和厨房用具来减少食品中的微塑料- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-food-by-changing-packaging-and-kitchen-utensils/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that normal use of plastic packaging and kitchen gear can shed tiny particles into what we eat and drink. It maps the science and suggests practical ways to cut everyday exposure to these microplastics from our food without turning daily routines upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reviewed evidence across many product types and everyday actions, from twisting open a cap to steeping a tea bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also launched an open dashboard that lets anyone explore where particles show up and how tests were done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-food-packaging"&gt;Microplastics in food packaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Lisa Zimmermann, from the &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Packaging Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich led the work. She was joined by collaborators from &lt;a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eawag&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed 103 studies and found that most reported plastic particles (microplastics or nanoplastics – MNPs) in foods or test liquids that had touched packaging or tools made with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also logged which test methods were used and how carefully the studies controlled for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only seven of the 103 studies met the highest reliability bar for answering the core question about particle release under normal use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one third used a kinetic design, for example, measuring how particle levels change with time, temperature, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first systematic evidence map to investigate the role of the normal and intended use of food contact articles in the contamination of foodstuffs with MNPs,” explained Dr. Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-microplastics-get-into-food"&gt;How microplastics get into food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use the term microplastics for plastic particles roughly 1 to 1000 micrometers in size. Even smaller pieces are nanoplastics, which are below 1 micrometer and can be harder to detect with current methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The items that touch food are called food contact articles, and they include &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;bottles&lt;/a&gt;, caps, pouches, wraps, cartons with plastic liners, tea bags, cutting boards, utensils, and parts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; processing machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these materials are polymers. These long, chain molecules can shed fragments when stressed by heat, abrasion, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61146-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; measured particle release during typical steps used to open packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that everyday actions like tearing a bag, scissoring a wrapper, or twisting a cap can generate plastic fragments. Heat and time can add to the stress, so hotter food contact and longer storage often matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-packaging-swaps-that-cut-microplastic-exposure"&gt;Packaging swaps that cut microplastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymer tea bags are an easy place to start. A single plastic tea bag, steeped around 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius), released about 11.6 billion microplastic and 3.1 billion nanoplastic particles in one cup, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose loose leaf tea with a stainless steel infuser or paper tea bags that are not sealed with plastic. If you do use bagged tea, avoid squeezing the bag or stirring it hard because added agitation can increase wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store drinks and sauces in glass or stainless steel when you can, and keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/agricultural-soil-is-now-the-worlds-biggest-plastic-dumping-ground/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; contact time short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you open a bottled drink, pour it into a glass rather than sipping and re capping many times. This will reduce friction at the threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for packaging that minimizes plastic on parts that rub, such as caps, spouts, and seals. Simpler closures with fewer plastic-on-plastic contact points are generally better for abrasion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smarter-utensils-and-kitchen-habits"&gt;Smarter utensils and kitchen habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting boards deserve attention because knives grind directly into the surface. Plastic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19440049.2021.2017002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cutting boards&lt;/a&gt; have been traced as the source of polyethylene fragments found in retail meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap plastic boards for wooden or glass models for most chopping tasks. If you keep plastic boards for raw meat handling, replace them when deep grooves appear and avoid heavy scraping that chews up the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use utensils that do not gouge soft plastics. Metal tips on soft plastic containers can scrape particles, so choose wooden or silicone tools for stirring inside plastic tubs, and preferably mix in glass or stainless steel bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid heating food in disposable plastic containers. Move leftovers into glass or ceramic before reheating so the hottest temperatures do not hit plastic parts that can wear under heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-health-and-microplastics"&gt;Food, health, and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is rapidly evolving on what these particles do in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; followed surgical patients who had some of their tissues analyzed for microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that patients with microplastics in plaque that was removed from neck arteries had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. They were followed over roughly 34 months, in the time following the analysis of their tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That result does not prove cause and effect, but it raises fair questions about reducing avoidable exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evidence map also stresses that better methods and consistent reporting are needed so scientists and regulators can compare results across labs with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy steps are on the table. The authors argue that regulators can require tests of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/most-energetic-neutrino-ever-detected-captured-at-km3net-mediterranean-sea/"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; migration from packaging and tools under real-use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could include investigations of the effects of time, temperature, and repeated use cycles. Harmonized testing would help industry design safer products and help shoppers make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are simple changes you can make today. Choose tea that avoids plastic, pick glass or stainless for hot foods and long storage, and keep plastic surfaces smooth and unscored by replacing worn items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-025-00470-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Science of Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:26:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPNkUyUTdMVTRaaTJScE5LMi1hS0NlaWIyVEdOVWJmUURmNXhSQmJFLWh4Y2ltSTV3ZFNteHFqX3hmempFUFVrSjRYbGtsMVpnV1hiRVRUdUE1UEZqbUItY3FEQUJ2ZjJ4dzhfTjBHZTlkNWpsU3RmLWVtTjhPcEVRWVdiNFBXMEYwcV96OEVNcm03clRTVWl4R3ZtdjVMLWg3UXBmQ242UW91Zw</guid></item><item><title>人体骨骼深处发现微塑料，科学家警告- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Find yourself prone to anxiety? The roots of the condition could stretch back to before you were even born, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine in the US have found that infection or stress in a mother &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; could increase the risk of the offspring developing anxiety as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000916"&gt;shown links&lt;/a&gt; between prenatal health problems and mental health issues later in life, including anxiety. In this latest investigation, researchers took a close look at potential neurological mechanisms that could be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;The Secret to Anxiety in Young Women's Brains May Have Been Found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team genetically engineered mice in a way that simulates extra inflammation that a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/profound-brain-changes-of-pregnancy-revealed-in-scientific-first"&gt;pregnant mother&lt;/a&gt; might experience under stressful conditions. Then, they carefully monitored the offspring produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on male offspring, who have more pronounced anxiety behaviors than females. These offspring were also genetically "normal", meaning they didn't inherit the predisposition for stress and inflammation from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, as adults, these offspring still showed telltale signs of anxiety, such as avoiding open spaces. What's more, scans indicated that a small number of brain cells in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;ventral dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; (vDG), which helps assess potential threats in the surrounding environment, were working overtime when the animals felt threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data reveal prenatal adversity left lasting imprints on the neurons of the vDG, linking gestational environment to anxiety-like behavior," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Miklos Toth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This mechanism may help explain the persistent stress sensitivity and avoidance seen in some individuals with innate anxiety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg" alt="Mouse pregnancy study" class="wp-image-174946 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mice exposed to stress in the womb were shown to be more anxious as adults. (Nabila et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of the mice, a chemical tagging system that controls whether specific genes are turned on or off. These on-off switches were modified at thousands of sites along DNA strands collected from the vDG, especially in gene regions that control neuron communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice felt they were under threat, it was in these reprogrammed areas where the neurons were working the hardest. It seems as though the mouse brains are coded to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-figuring-out-if-its-anxiety-adhd-or-both-matters"&gt;more anxious&lt;/a&gt; about potential threats, and more eager to avoid them, even before the threat has actually appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, these  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="174943" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; are instructing certain neurons in the vDG to respond differently in adulthood when faced with unsafe environments," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Kristen Pleil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The neurons show too much activity, ultimately contributing to the mice perceiving the environment as more threatening than it actually is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is one of the more common mental health problems, and is thought to affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017"&gt;almost a third of us&lt;/a&gt; at some point during our lifetimes. Scientists are consistently making new discoveries about the different factors that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;increase the risk of anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and how we might be able &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;to better treat it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only shown in mice so far, this new study hints at how the earliest stages of life could influence anxiety risk in adults, and may even feed into the development of diagnostic tests for the condition and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-5-minute-breathing-technique-is-a-powerful-tool-to-reduce-anxiety"&gt;perhaps even treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a reminder of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-linked-to-cognitive-boost-in-children"&gt;how vital a healthy pregnancy is&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are keen to continue their work by looking more closely at the mechanism they've uncovered, and why only a subset of neurons are affected by stresses in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A mouse may have almost 400,000 cells in the vDG, but only a few thousand are impacted during pregnancy," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Toth. "Next, we really want to understand why these certain cells are epigenetically programmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding blueberries to babies may reduce allergy symptoms and improve their gut health, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground-breaking clinical trial shows consuming the fruit early in life can improve immunity and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding blueberries to babies as one of their first solid foods may help strengthen their immune systems, reduce allergy symptoms and support healthy gut development, says scientists at the University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To safely introduce the “superfood” to younger infants, the research team recommend pureeing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For older babies and toddlers, they say blueberries should be mashed or cut into small pieces to eliminate choking hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1623521/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; published in the journal&lt;/a&gt; Frontiers in Nutrition, is the first of its kind to rigorously test the effects of a specific food on infant health using a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For parents beginning to wean their infants, it’s incredibly difficult to find solid, research-backed advice on what foods to introduce,” &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/blueberries-can-improve-infants-immunity-and-gut-health-cu-anschutz-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said the study’s senior author&lt;/a&gt; Professor Minghua Tang, from the University of Colorado in Anschutz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study is a critical first step in filling that gap by offering real data on how a specific food like blueberries can improve your infant’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOOD FOR SENIORS TOO&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed 61 babies in the Denver area from five to 12 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, participants consumed either freeze-dried blueberry powder, or a placebo powder with no blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents were free to feed their children as they normally would, simply adding the powder to their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team collected stool and blood samples every two months to monitor changes in the infants’ gut bacteria, immune system biomarkers and allergy-related outcomes. They also tracked growth and dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings included improved allergy symptoms in babies who consumed blueberry powder, reduced inflammation and signs of a stronger immune response, and “positive” shifts in gut microbiota—with changes considered beneficial for immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research supports the idea that blueberries are not only safe for infants but also offer meaningful health benefits,” added Professor Tang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a few blueberries a day could make a difference in supporting long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLUEBERRIES FOR FERTILITY&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Natural Compound in Grapes and Berries May Aid in Fertility, Resveratrol Study Shows" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/natural-compound-in-grapes-and-berries-may-aid-in-fertility-resveratrol-study-shows/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Natural Compound in Grapes and Berries May Aid in Fertility, Resveratrol Study Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We view infancy as a critical window of opportunity and what we introduce during this time can have lasting effects as children grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team is continuing to explore what other early foods might help support healthy gut bacteria and a strong immune system as babies grow to ensure there’s better guidance in place for parents.&lt;/p&gt;

But the headlines keep jolting us out of this long-held belief — teenagers collapsing on sports fields, young professionals dying suddenly in gyms, college students found unresponsive after a night of dancing. Each tragedy raises the same haunting question: could it have been prevented?&lt;br&gt;Doctors now believe that to prevent heart disease from striking in the 20s, we need to start acting in pre-teens and early teens.

While many participants had completed higher education and were employed or in relationships, the study found that those diagnosed in adulthood reported more psychiatric conditions, higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and fewer self-perceived strengths. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autism Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, point to a need for more research and tailored support for this often-overlooked population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a developmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors. While research and diagnosis have traditionally centered on boys, more recent efforts have drawn attention to the ways autism may present differently in women and nonbinary people. Females are less likely to be diagnosed in early childhood, in part due to more subtle behavioral signs and greater likelihood of “masking,” or consciously imitating neurotypical social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women and gender-diverse individuals have also been underrepresented in clinical studies due to narrow inclusion criteria, diagnostic biases, and the tendency of researchers to exclude people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities, who are disproportionately female. As a result, there has been limited understanding of what life looks like for autistic women and nonbinary individuals beyond childhood—especially those who are diagnosed in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study set out to better characterize this population by assessing a wide range of factors, including education, employment, relationships, psychiatric history, and self-perceived mental health. A second goal was to explore how outcomes differ between those diagnosed in childhood versus adulthood, with the aim of understanding how timing of diagnosis may shape long-term experiences and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research focuses on diverse experiences of autism, including adult populations and autistic females,” said study author Maire Claire Diemer, a clinical psychology postdoctoral fellow at the Medical University of South Carolina. “It’s important to me to fill this gap in the literature and represent what I can as accurately as I can about broader experiences of autistic presentations. Research has often excluded adults, women, and people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities which means that the literature does not always reflect their experiences. This can have clinical implications for care as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from &lt;a href="https://sparkforautism.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SPARK&lt;/a&gt;, a large national research cohort in the United States that includes over 100,000 autistic individuals and family members. The sample for this study included 1,424 participants who identified as women or were assigned female at birth and identified as nonbinary. All participants were age 18 or older and had received a professional diagnosis of autism either in childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be included in the analysis, participants had to provide independent consent and complete several self-report forms about their demographic background, medical and psychiatric history, and psychological functioning. Individuals under guardianship or with uncertain autism diagnoses were excluded to ensure reliability of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a standardized psychological questionnaire known as the Adult Self Report, which assesses areas such as internalizing symptoms (like anxiety and depression), externalizing symptoms (like aggression and rule-breaking), substance use, adaptive functioning, and personal strengths. The researchers also collected information about participants’ education, employment, income, romantic relationships, and sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the responses of those who had been diagnosed before age 18 with those who had received a diagnosis in adulthood. They used statistical methods to control for age at enrollment, since those diagnosed as children were, on average, younger at the time of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis among the full sample was 24 years, but there was wide variability. Those diagnosed in childhood were typically diagnosed around age 9, while those diagnosed as adults received their diagnosis at an average age of 32. Nearly two-thirds of the sample had been diagnosed after turning 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges often associated with autism, many participants reported positive life outcomes. More than half were employed, and over 80 percent had completed some post-secondary education. Nearly one-third were married, and more than half reported having a romantic partner. Those diagnosed in adulthood were more likely to have a four-year college degree, full-time employment, and higher household incomes than those diagnosed in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, rates of co-occurring psychiatric conditions were high. Around 70 percent of participants reported a history of anxiety, and 62 percent had been diagnosed with depression. Eating disorders were reported by 17 percent of the sample, and almost 9 percent had a substance use diagnosis. A third of all participants reported experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 21 percent said they had engaged in self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diemer was particularly surprised by the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior. “While I feared there would be increased risks, the high rate still shocked and concerned me,” she told PsyPost. “We have really limited research into what might be driving this or what we can do to be preventative on this front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two groups, those diagnosed as adults were significantly more likely to report psychiatric conditions. They were more likely to have anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, and reported higher levels of substance use. On average, they also scored higher on internalizing and externalizing problem scales and lower on measures of personal strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns held even after controlling for other demographic variables like age, education, employment, and parenthood. Later age of diagnosis remained a significant predictor of psychological distress. The researchers suggest that these differences may reflect the cumulative impact of going through childhood and adolescence without the support or self-understanding that a diagnosis can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found elevated levels of suicidal ideation and self-harm among participants who identified as gender-diverse or as part of a sexual minority. While 14 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants reported self-harm or suicide attempts, the rate was nearly 27 percent among those identifying as queer or gender-diverse. Suicidal thoughts were endorsed by 41 percent of gender and sexual minorities, compared to 26 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest concern here is the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior,” Diemer said. “As researchers, we expected higher rates of co-occurring concerns in this sample compared to a neurotypical sample based on prior findings. However, more than two thirds of our sample had depression diagnoses, and overall rates were much higher than even we expected. Supports for autistic adults is extremely limited, and more wraparound services and mental health care with specialized focus is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides important insights, it is not without limitations. The sample was overwhelmingly white and highly educated, which may not reflect the broader population of autistic women and nonbinary people. The participants were also self-selected and enrolled in a research study requiring internet access and independent consent, which may have skewed the sample toward individuals with lower support needs and higher cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This sample is not as racially diverse as the population as a whole; over-representation of the white female autistic perspective means that the generalizability of the findings are limited,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the authors argue that the findings point to clear directions for future research and clinical care. In particular, they emphasize the need to understand the lived experiences of those who receive an autism diagnosis in adulthood. They also highlight the importance of developing targeted mental health interventions that address the specific challenges faced by autistic women and nonbinary individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to continue examining data we have on autistic females, and hopefully presenting some other findings from this sample soon,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Comparative Analysis of Autistic Women Across the Lifespan: Childhood vs. Adulthood Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Maire Claire Diemer, Rosmary Ros-Demarize, Catherine C.

			&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most heart attacks have been blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href="https://cardiology.com.sg/atherothrombosis/"&gt;atherothrombosis&lt;/a&gt; – where blood clots block flow to the heart. But new research suggests we may be underestimating the role of other causes, particularly in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Mayo Clinic in the US analyzed 1,474 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;heart attack cases&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 65 or younger, recorded between 2003 and 2018 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. By carefully reviewing medical records and imaging, they identified a primary cause behind each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atherothrombosis accounted for 75 percent of heart attacks in men, which wasn't surprising. In women, it was the cause of 47 percent – less than half. That has major implications for the prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;treatment of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-heart-attack-hack-on-social-media-could-put-lives-at-risk-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral Heart Attack 'Hack' on Social Media Could Put Lives at Risk, Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shines a spotlight on heart attack causes that have historically been under-recognized, particularly in women," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Claire Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the root cause of a heart attack is misunderstood, it can lead to treatments that are less effective – or even harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg" alt="Heart attack causes" class="wp-image-175234 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There were significant differences in heart attack causes between men and women. (Raphael et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other factors significantly contributing to heart attacks were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_coronary_artery_dissection"&gt;spontaneous coronary artery dissections&lt;/a&gt; (SCADs), where tears in artery walls collect blood, embolisms (blood clots traveling from other areas of the body), and other stressors acting on the body (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"&gt;such as anemia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that many SCAD-related heart attacks were initially misattributed to atherothrombosis, especially in women, where SCAD was the cause nearly six times as frequently. If heart attack causes are misdiagnosed, then doctors might take the wrong approach to trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-vitamin-may-help-prevent-heart-attacks-new-evidence"&gt;prevent the next one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research highlights the larger need to rethink how we approach heart attacks in this patient population, and for younger adult women, in particular," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Rajiv Gulati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians must sharpen their awareness of conditions like SCAD, embolism and stress-related triggers, and patients should advocate for answers when something doesn't feel right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn't explore the significant difference here between men and women, but it could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;heart attack risk factors&lt;/a&gt; affecting women differently, or women being less likely to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that future research can look into, as well as using the same analysis techniques across larger and more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, someone experiences a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;every 40 seconds&lt;/a&gt;, and work continues to try and understand as much as we can about the risk factors – which include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;city living&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-particles-in-the-air-may-trigger-sudden-heart-attacks-study-suggests"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, as the team notes, we're getting better at spotting, diagnosing, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047065"&gt;preventing heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; from recurring.

					&lt;p&gt;After you reach 40, it’s natural to experience hormonal shifts, slower recovery time, and a decline in physical activity. All of this speeds up sarcopenia, the loss of lean muscle mass. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-build-muscle-as-you-age/" target="_blank"&gt;Building and maintaining muscle&lt;/a&gt; is essential for leading an all-around healthy, independent, and active lifestyle. The good news is, you can work out with just your body weight to achieve noticeable strength gains. We spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/mattdustin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Dustin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NASM corrective exercise specialist with &lt;i&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, who shares four stellar &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-strength-no-equipment/" target="_blank"&gt;bodyweight exercises&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-bodyweight-power-moves-stop-muscle-loss-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;stop muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; more effectively than weight machines after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Muscle is critical for maintaining metabolism, protecting bone density, and preserving balance and mobility,” Dustin stresses. “If you don’t fight back with resistance work, you lose strength and independence more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;That’s where bodyweight training comes in clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bodyweight training demands full-body coordination, stability, and balance. Machines usually isolate a muscle while providing extra support, but bodyweight movements make your joints, stabilizers, and nervous system work together,” Dustin adds. “That makes them more functional and they translate better to real-life strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Effective Bodyweight Exercises To Prevent Muscle Loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on your core, glutes, and legs is essential, as Dustin notes they’re “the foundation for movement and balance.” Of course, don’t neglect your upper body—especially the shoulders and back—to maintain solid posture and avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if you don’t train your lower body and trunk, mobility, and independence go fast,” Dustin adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bring your hands to your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one foot forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core as you bend your knees, lowering to form 90-degree bends in both legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your upper body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your front heel and the ball of your back foot to rise back up.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This move builds core stability and gives your shoulders some extra work, too,” Dustin points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a high plank with your hands under your shoulders and body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your right hand to tap your left shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hand on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap your left hand to your right shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to alternate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets, holding each plank for 20 to 40 seconds, tapping each shoulder as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Three children have died of measles this week as a monthslong outbreak continues to spread across Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the victims of the disease this week were younger than two, and all three died in Jerusalem, according to hospital officials and the Health Ministry. The first death was announced on Monday, another died on Wednesday night, and the third died Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, five children, all younger than two and a half years old, have died of measles since August. They are the first fatalities from measles in Israel since a previous outbreak hit the country in 2018-2019. The fatalities in that bout of measles were the first Israel had seen since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, which began in May, is active throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have appeared in the central cities of Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh and Bnei Brak, the northern cities of Harish and Nof HaGalil, the southern cities of Ashdod and Kiryat Gat, and the West Bank settlement of Modi’in Illit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Three Jerusalem children die of measles this week as outbreak continues"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, 21 measles patients are hospitalized, most of them children 6 or under who have not been vaccinated against measles. Of these, six children are in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late August, the Health Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/770-measles-cases-detected-in-israel-in-past-three-months-says-health-ministry/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 770 people in Israel had been diagnosed with measles over the past three months. Multiple people with measles, or who had been exposed to the disease, are reported to have come to Israel on flights from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, life-threatening viral disease. When symptoms appear, it is important to inform medical teams to allow treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through an effective and safe vaccine. Doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/infectious-disease-doctor-calls-on-community-leaders-to-encourage-measles-vaccines/"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; ramped-up vaccination drives in response to the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
