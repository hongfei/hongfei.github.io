                &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health reported 27 new cases of measles on Tuesday, all identified since last Friday, bringing the total number of identified cases in the state this year to 114. There are currently at least 254 people in quarantine in South Carolina, though the problem isn’t just confined to one state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest figures from the CDC, which haven’t been updated in over a week and don’t include hundreds of recent cases, indicate there have been 1,828 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year as of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;December 2&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have died from measles in 2025, two kids and one adult, the first deaths from the disease in this country since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. officially eliminated measles as an endemic disease in the year 2000, thanks to the widespread vaccination programs of the 20th century. But America’s federal public health infrastructure saw a hostile takeover by anti-vaccine activists in January, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his so-called Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been 46 measles outbreaks identified in the U.S. in 2025, and 87% of confirmed cases have been associated with outbreaks, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same disease linked to a common source. If the outbreaks continue into January 2026, it will mark a year since they began in &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. will then officially lose its &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/canada-will-soon-lose-its-hard-won-measles-free-status-america-is-next-2000678788"&gt;measles-free status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The latest confirmed cases in South Carolina&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health first identified an outbreak in the state’s Upstate region on October 2, starting with eight cases, mostly concentrated in Spartanburg County. That number has grown to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-27-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-111"&gt;111 cases&lt;/a&gt; in the area, which makes up the vast majority of the 114 cases in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The public exposure sites in South Carolina have included Inman Intermediate School, where 43 students are currently in quarantine. Students at the school, which has kids in 4th-6th grade, first went into quarantine December 4 and will be able to return to class on December 15 if they don’t become ill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the new cases reported on Tuesday come from Way of Truth Church in Inman, with eight of those cases coming from household exposures to measles. One new case of measles came from “exposure in a health care setting,” according to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, though more details about that case were not released. The agency encourages those who’ve been potentially exposed to measles to notify their health care provider before coming in so that proper arrangements can be made to protect others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The age breakdown of South Carolina’s known measles cases in 2025 has included: Under 5 years old (20), 5-17 (75), 18+: 10. There have been 6 minors whose ages haven’t been disclosed to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, 105 of the measles cases identified in South Carolina have been from people who were unvaccinated. Three cases have been in people who were partially vaccinated, receiving just one dose of the recommended two-dose MMR shots. Just one person in the state’s outbreak was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;New cases in Utah and Arizona&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services has identified 115 measles cases this year, with 26 cases identified in the past three weeks, according to the agency’s &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;online dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new case was reported Monday at the Bingham Kooper Kids childcare facility, located inside Bingham High School in the city of South Jordan. The person was unvaccinated, according to local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;ABC4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s unclear where the person was initially infected and whether they were a child or an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s a long list of potential measles exposure &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; in Utah, including two elementary schools, a junior high school, a high school, two emergency rooms, a Walmart, and the Treehouse Children’s Museum in Ogden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utah’s measles cases have been concentrated in the southwest region of the state, where it shares a border with Arizona, a state that has identified 23 of its own cases in the past two weeks. Arizona has seen 176 measles cases this year, with 97% of cases in unvaccinated patients, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. Sixty-six percent of cases in Arizona have occurred in people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine nonsense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has been officially consumed by far-right activists ever since President Donald Trump took power in January. Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and he quickly worked to radically alter the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To take just some recent examples, Kennedy has claimed without evidence that peanut allergies are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-is-now-blaming-vaccines-on-peanut-allergies-despite-the-evidence-2000689593"&gt;caused by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s installed anti-vaccine activist &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-taps-preacher-who-blames-vaccines-for-cancer-compares-covid-tracking-to-nazi-germany-2000694531"&gt;Kirk Milhoan&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to remove a recommendation that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-are-doing-harm-rfk-jr-s-acip-guts-universal-hep-b-vaccination-at-birth-2000695747"&gt;from birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is grossly unqualified for the job and quite literally doesn’t believe in germ theory. And as long as he and his MAHA buddies are allowed to continue dismantling the country’s public health infrastructure, we’re going to see more cases of measles, a disease that can induce something called “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s immune amnesia? It’s when your immune system forgets how to fight the pathogens it successfully &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;fought off before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

'I was far too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't in a crisis or asking for help, but I think the environment that I was in really only honored one narrow version of "normal", and I just didn't fit that template of how a child was supposed to behave or perform in the classroom setting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time she left her home in Philadelphia for college, Gansky was on 14 different medications every day, including stimulants Adderall and Concerta, and the antidepressant Prozac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Gansky, pictured here as a child, was just seven years old when she was prescribed Ritalin. Over the years, the cascade of medications included more than a dozen different pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was told I had a chemical imbalance and I needed to treat it, but as I got older, I knew something wasn't right,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted to see who I was underneath all these drugs, and I knew I needed to come off them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After Gansky graduated in 2019, her doctor began to taper her off the cascade of medications over a course of several weeks. But Gansky felt this wasn't enough time to allow her body to adjust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that a longer duration of antidepressant use, or at least two years, was associated with a greater likelihood of severe withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, stomach cramps, balance issues, mood swings and mania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.9.12"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested people who have been on multiple behavioral and psychiatric medications for several years need to taper off of them over a period of years, not weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It was] dangerously fast for someone who has been on these drugs long term,' Gansky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was simply harmed by coming off these drugs exactly the way my doctor told me to. And then, what followed was a severe, life-altering, full-body neurological crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured at left and right during childhood, told the Daily Mail she was a spunky, energetic child, but doctors were quick to diagnose her with ADHD and medicate her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, Gansky had stopped all of the drugs and was thrust into a 'living nightmare of physical and psychological torment' when she developed a condition called akathisia, which can occur after discontinuing antidepressants or antipsychotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The name comes from the Greek word 'akathemi,' which translates to 'inability to sit.' Patients like Gansky suffer such intense restlessness and tension that a burning sensation rips through their bodies, leading to extreme anxiety that drives many to self-harm and suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It completely changed the course of my life,' Gansky said. 'The pain was unlike anything I'd ever known or experienced or thought humanly possible, like my entire nervous system was hijacked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of akathisia is unclear, experts believe it is due to sudden shifts in neurotransmitters - like dopamine and serotonin - and disrupted pathways as the body adjusts to changes in medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dopamine is key for controlling movement. People with Parkinson's disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine-producing cells, suffer uncontrolled movements due to this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After graduating college in 2019, Gansky decided to start tapering off of her antidepressants. This sent her into extreme withdrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Akathisia is the most common movement disorder associated with psychiatric drug use and withdrawal, according to Mayo Clinic, yet there is no definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear how many people have it, but experts estimate about 15 to 35 percent of the 6 million Americans on antipsychotics may suffer from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experiencing the akathisia, Gansky was unable to eat and saw snow-like dots in her vision. She could hardly focus between bouts of rage, agitation and 'brain zaps,' and her skin seared with a 'constant sensation of acid being poured' on her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a state of internal torture to your nervous system,' she told the Daily Mail. 'It was just chaos, and I was basically bedridden and physically couldn't take care of myself because I couldn't function. It's just chemical torture. I never experienced suffering like that in my life.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail that her doctor claimed 'withdrawal doesn't exist' and is not possible because the pills 'were out of her system.' He insisted her symptoms were proof she needed to be on her medications and that she was too young to be suffering from such severe withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of depression and anxiety, including panic attacks, returned with a vengeance as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt very betrayed,' she said. 'I had to trust him to keep me safe, but his credentials automatically outweighed my lived experience. I was just completely gaslit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured here during childhood, believes a few weeks was not enough time to taper off of her antidepressants after taking them for so many years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky eventually checked herself into a hospital, but she claims doctors insisted she was exaggerating and that her symptoms were proof that she needed to be medicated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky spent about five months completely bedridden, often waking up from nightmares shaking and screaming on the floor and unable to get dressed, before checking herself into a hospital for in-patient psychiatric care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she claimed that doctors insisted she was exaggerating or just suffering from bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of desperation, Gansky decided to start taking the SSRI fluvoxamine, which is used for OCD and social anxiety, in hopes it would give her her life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of two and a half months on fluvoxamine, her body slowly began to stabilize and allow her to function once again. However, she 'never quite felt right' after initially going through withdrawal and would frequently suffer emotional breakdowns or periods of severe depression and anxiety that lasted for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky claimed that doctors insisted she just needed to go back on the medications she had so desperately tried to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she said a doctor believed her wanting to taper slowly was a sign of OCD. Another doctor, however, claimed she could go off fluvoxamine 'cold turkey' with no tapering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led Gansky to stop fluvoxamine without tapering. But in just weeks, 'I basically found myself back in that same withdrawal nightmare again,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a few months of quitting fluvoxamine, she lost 20 pounds and again felt chained to her bed. Doctors prescribed her olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, neither of which Gansky was formally diagnosed with. However, doctors suggested her behavior may have been a sign of bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken unnecessarily, medications like Zyprexa can worsen or cause akathisia. For Gansky, it was like suffering from 'a chemical lobotomy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was bedbound for another couple years, and then I was unable to drive or do basic tasks,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I lost my sense of self. I had profound cognitive impairment, memory loss. My creativity, my intelligence, my ability to feel love or joy, everything that made me, me, was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to relearn basic functions. I was getting lost in my own house. I went from being a vibrant, joyful person who loved life to feeling chronically ill and disabled. I was in my 20s grieving the loss of my own mind and life. I felt like it had been taken from me too soon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail she is 'still healing,' but is hoping her story will inspire stricter tapering guidelines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To escape from the endless loop of withdrawal, Gansky is now back on about 58mg of fluvoxamine, just over half the typical 100mg starting dose, and is working with a compounding pharmacy that can adjust her dose by a fraction of a milligram if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has, however, been able to stay off her other medications, and the fluvoxamine helps to keep her anxiety and depression at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also sits on the advisory board for the Antidepressant Coalition for Education, a nonprofit that works to raise awareness of antidepressant side effects and withdrawal. Currently, the group is working with the FDA to update tapering guidelines and add black box warnings about withdrawal risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her work has also led her to meeting FDA commissioner Dr Marty Makary and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, both of whom have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-15082071/RFK-Jr-overmedication-shooting-childhood-disease.html"&gt;openly criticized the 'overmedication' of SSRIs in minors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky now sits on the advisory board for the Antidepressant Coalition for Education, which is working with the FDA and Robert F Kennedy Jr (pictured here with Gansky) to update tapering guidelines and labels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail that while she is not against the use of antidepressants, she hopes her advocacy work and the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement pushed by RFK Jr can lead to stricter tapering guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much of that advocacy work, however, is done from Gansky's bed, as she is still weakened by the effects of such severe withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm still healing,' she said. 'For most of my life, my inner reality was dismissed or reinterpreted for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was silenced and dismissed at every turn, and I know so many others are as well. My story is just one window into a much larger public health crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;psychiatric conditions&lt;/a&gt; have common biological roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;cluster into five categories&lt;/a&gt;, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fellow travellers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03180-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_51535866.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk sharing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02210-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_23392166.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain-cell growth keeps mood disorders at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A single sperm donor who carries a rare cancer-causing genetic mutation has fathered at least 197 children across 14 countries in Europe, according to &lt;a href="https://investigations.news-exchange.ebu.ch/donor-7069-tp53-mutation-exposes-sperm-banking-crisis/"&gt;a collaborative investigation by 14 European news groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their investigative report, some of the children have already died, and many others are expected to develop deadly cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man—Donor 7069, alias “Kjeld”—carries a rare mutation in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/"&gt;TP53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gene, which codes for a critical tumor suppressor called protein 53 or p53. This protein (which is a transcription factor) keeps cells from dividing uncontrollably, can activate DNA repair processes amid damage, and can trigger cell death when a cell is beyond repair. Many cancers are linked to mutations in p53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a p53 mutation is passed down in sperm (a germline mutation), it causes a rare autosomal dominant condition called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/li-fraumeni-syndrome/#causes"&gt;Li Fraumeni syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of a variety of cancers in childhood and young adults. Those include cancers of the brain, blood, bone, soft tissue, adrenal glands, and breast, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated frequency of this type of mutation is between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 20,000 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the investigation, the man was unaffected by the condition, but the mutation was present in around 20 percent of his sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

So far, I’ve tackled &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a69030847/what-happens-when-you-eat-spinach-every-day/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a69030847/what-happens-when-you-eat-spinach-every-day/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spinach" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a69219740/what-happens-when-you-eat-olive-oil-every-day/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a69219740/what-happens-when-you-eat-olive-oil-every-day/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="olive oil" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a69451670/what-happens-when-you-eat-prunes-every-day/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a69451670/what-happens-when-you-eat-prunes-every-day/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="prunes" data-node-id="1.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I survived to tell the tale). This time, the assignment was refreshingly straightforward: Eat a protein bar every single day for a week and share what happened to my body. Simple, clear, and right up my alley as both a dietitian and a fan of food experiments. Thankfully, she let me pick the brand of bar I’d enjoy every day. Funny enough, I was about to grab a protein bar when she made the request, so the timing couldn’t have been better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;With the assignment in hand, I set out to make this experiment as simple and practical as possible. For seven days, I committed to the bar. Here’s exactly what happened to my body, my hunger levels, and my carpool routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="3" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="How I included a protein bar into my routine" data-anchor-id="how-i-included-a-protein-bar-into-my-routine" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;How I included a protein bar into my routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When it came to choosing my protein bar for the week, a quick glance at my pantry revealed two boxes of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/RXBAR/page/DAE8C712-51D4-4003-93D9-DA4B842EEA8A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/RXBAR/page/DAE8C712-51D4-4003-93D9-DA4B842EEA8A" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rx Bars" data-vars-ga-product-id="2580942f-5e47-4f85-ad52-4320c6d07b2a" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Rx Bars&lt;/a&gt; I’d already stocked up on. As a dietitian, I genuinely appreciate foods that are honest about what’s inside, and Rx Bar does just that; their ingredient list is right on the front, made up of simple, whole-food ingredients. I also like the nutrients these bars contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Plus, I’m a total sucker for seasonal marketing, and their holiday-themed flavors (&lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gingerbread" data-vars-membership-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/gingerbread-retailer-list" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;gingerbread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/RXBAR-Whole-Protein-Pumpkin-1-83oz/dp/B0143NQVJ8" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/RXBAR-Whole-Protein-Pumpkin-1-83oz/dp/B0143NQVJ8" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pumpkin spice" data-vars-ga-product-id="f1710f57-2b10-4048-b419-25c6adaf01a2" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="6.3" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;pumpkin spice&lt;/a&gt;) were already calling my name before I even started this experiment. It felt like a win-win: I could get my festive flavor fix without spending a small fortune at the local coffee shop every afternoon, and I could finally put a dent in the stash taking up valuable shelf space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I quickly identified the perfect window for my “dose.” Like many of my clients, I often get swept up in the midday hustle. I’ll eat breakfast, dive into emails, and suddenly realize it’s 1:30 PM, time to dart out the door for carpool, and I haven’t had lunch yet. So for this week, I made it a habit to stash a bar in my bag every morning. When that dreaded mid-afternoon hunger pang hit (usually as I parked to wait for my daughter to hop into my car after school), I unwrapped a protein bar and got snacking. And that small routine turned out to be one of the best acts of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="8" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happened when I ate a protein bar every day" data-anchor-id="what-happened-when-i-ate-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What happened when I ate a protein bar every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The first thing I noticed during my experiment was how much steadier my energy felt throughout the afternoon. Because I ate the bar around 1:30 PM, I found it much easier to power through both my mom and work duties without feeling distracted or sluggish. On most days, I didn’t even feel like I needed my usual mid-afternoon cup of coffee. Go figure—fueling my body with actual calories and nutrients made a difference to my energy level and ability to focus! I suppose this is a sign for me to start practicing what I preach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What surprised me even more was that, despite the sugar content in the bar, I didn’t experience the dreaded sugar crash I sometimes get when I drink a regular soda or eat something overly sweet. The combination of protein, fiber, and natural sugars (from, in this brand’s instance, dates) seemed to work together to keep my blood sugar levels stable. It was a refreshing change from the quick spike-and-crash cycle I’ve felt with other snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;And while I can’t see the long-term results of adding more protein to my diet after just one week, as a dietitian in my mid-40s, I know it’s a smart move. As women age, maintaining muscle mass becomes increasingly important for overall health, metabolism, and strength. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806046/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40806046/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protein plays a key role in supporting these areas" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Protein plays a key role in supporting these areas&lt;/a&gt;, and incorporating it into my daily routine (even in small, convenient ways like a protein bar) feels like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="12" data-lazy-id="P0-18"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happens when you eat a protein bar every day?" data-anchor-id="what-happens-when-you-eat-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What happens when you eat a protein bar every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Here are some things you may experience if you eat a protein bar every day as a part of a balanced and healthy diet: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;Aid muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Protein is essential for muscle repair and recovery, especially if you’re active. When you exercise, your muscles experience tiny tears that need to be repaired to grow stronger. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7909540/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7909540/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protein provides the amino acids your body needs to rebuild and strengthen those muscles" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Protein provides the amino acids your body needs to rebuild and strengthen those muscles&lt;/a&gt;. The egg whites in Rx Bars, for example, are a complete protein, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids your body can’t produce on its own. This makes them an excellent choice for supporting muscle recovery after a workout or even a long day of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;Support bone health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Protein plays a crucial role in maintaining bone density, especially as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.osteoporosis.foundation/health-professionals/prevention/nutrition/protein-and-other-nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.osteoporosis.foundation/health-professionals/prevention/nutrition/protein-and-other-nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="It helps" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;It helps&lt;/a&gt; form the structural matrix of bones and supports the repair of bone tissue.

This was especially true for me during my experiment—my mid-afternoon hunger pangs were no match for the combination of protein and fiber in the bars I ate. While I recommend eating a balanced meal rather than a bar for lunch, for certain people (a-hem, me), lunch sometimes falls to the wayside, so having a protein bar as a backup can be a practical way to stay nourished and avoid skipping meals altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="protein-bar-nutrition-rx-bar" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Here’s what you’re generally getting in one standard Rx Bar (approximate values based on a 52 g bar). &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Values can vary based on the variety chosen" data-vars-membership-link="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars/classic-12g.html" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Values can vary based on the variety chosen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="24" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.0"&gt;Calories: ~210&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.1"&gt;Total Fat: 7–9 g (mostly from nuts like almonds or cashews)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.2"&gt;Total Carbohydrates: 23–24 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.3"&gt;Dietary Fiber: 5 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.4"&gt;Total Sugars: 13–15 g (primarily from dates)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.5"&gt;Added Sugars: 0 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="24.6"&gt;Protein: 12g (from egg whites)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The standout here is the protein-to-fiber ratio. Getting 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in a 200-calorie package is a solid nutritional investment. The sugar count might look high at first glance, but it’s crucial to note that these are natural sugars from dates, not high-fructose corn syrup or cane sugar. Dates provide quick energy along with potassium and fiber. However, even though the sugars come from a natural source and they have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402123000012" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402123000012" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lower glycemic index" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;, there is still a chance that they may impact blood sugar levels, so individuals monitoring their blood sugar should be mindful of portion sizes and timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-20"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What to look for when picking a protein bar" data-anchor-id="what-to-look-for-when-picking-a-protein-bar" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What to look for when picking a protein bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Not all protein bars are created equal.

Look for high-quality sources like whey isolate, egg whites, or pea protein. Collagen is popular but isn’t a complete protein, so it shouldn’t be your only source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;Watch added sugars:&lt;/strong&gt; Added sugar should be kept to a minimum, especially if you aren’t in need of copious amounts of energy support, aka you aren’t scaling a mountain or mountain biking for 5 hours straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;Inspect fiber content:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber is your friend for fullness. Look for at least 3 grams of fiber per bar to help with digestion and satiety. Be cautious with prebiotic fibers if you have a sensitive stomach, as they may cause bloating for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;Check for allergens:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a food allergy, always check the label to ensure the bar you are choosing wasn’t made with something that may trigger a reaction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="29" data-lazy-id="P0-21"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Who shouldn’t eat a protein bar every day?" data-anchor-id="who-shouldnt-eat-a-protein-bar-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;Who shouldn’t eat a protein bar every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While protein bars can be a convenient and nutritious option, they’re not for everyone. If you’re already consuming a high-protein diet, adding a protein bar might lead to excess protein intake, which some people, like those with kidney disease, should be cautious about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you’re someone who struggles with portion control or tends to rely on packaged foods, eating a protein bar every day might displace more nutrient-dense options like fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Protein bars should supplement a balanced diet, not replace it. Finally, if you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols or prebiotic fibers, some bars may cause digestive discomfort, so it’s important to read the label carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After seven days of snacking, I can honestly say I’m a fan of the daily protein bar habit. Choosing the right one for your needs is key. Not all bars are the same, and what works for me might not work for you. If you’re unsure about what to look for, consider meeting with a dietitian to help you navigate the options and find one that aligns with your health goals, dietary preferences, and lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to increase protein intake, manage hunger, or fuel your workouts, a dietitian can help you make an informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, a protein bar can be a smart addition to your routine if you’re busy, prone to skipping meals, or need a portable safety net against the drive-thru. Yes, even though it is considered an ultra-processed food (not all ultra-processed foods are created equal.  Some can provide important nutrients and fit into an overall healthy and balanced diet). Just make sure it fits your nutrition needs and tastes good, because life’s too short for chalky snacks. And remember, balance is everything: A protein bar is a tool, not a magic bullet. Use it wisely, and it can be a helpful part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.&lt;br data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPWG9nR1F3WVFDVjNTbmI5bVRYdUlFUjNFeDg1Sm0yMVAyUF9UUnF1amgyTnYzaXh3RHlCUUJ5SXlnMVlkbWdSV2xHUFZfUk1uZkM4V29udnpLR3FpcEVFRzVCSEZ2aUFObWlhQ1J3WUJvZ0NUMHdNZkk4U2tQZVNHLVNDa0pnbHBCOWFqbkpvUWRlTXphQUhvaDdCZFRvSUpNd1FZ</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的医生：我的医生告诉我Paxlovid可以治愈新冠肺炎时不在基地，所以我不需要接种疫苗- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/advice/2025/12/dear-doctor-was-my-doctor-off-base-when-he-told-me-paxlovid-cures-covid-so-i-dont-need-to-be-vaccinated.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N4Y2C46ICVAWFLCP7WMAVMWPDM"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 74-year-old woman who is in better-than-average shape for my age. I only take blood pressure meds, walk for exercise, and am only slightly overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BQPMFP3CLRDRFGRKAVEIZBNZPA"&gt;I have had seven COVID vaccinations from February 2021 to September of this year. I asked my primary doctor if I should get more, and he said “no.” His reasoning is that Paxlovid cures COVID, so we don’t have to get vaccinated anymore. He, himself, is not getting any more shots. I never contracted COVID that I know of. Any thoughts? -- J.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TL2MEXVYMZHJHFBONDPTSTU6N4"&gt;ANSWER: Yes, I have a strong opinion about this, and I completely disagree with your doctor. It is fantastic that we have Paxlovid as it absolutely helps people get better faster, and it reduces the risk of severe COVID by about half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVLOCXXQVRB6FE6SSKM3STLLRI"&gt;This is most important for people who are at a higher risk of hospitalizations because people who are at a low risk, including most healthy people who are up-to-date with their vaccines, don’t benefit much from Paxlovid. Being 74 and slightly overweight and having high blood pressure puts you at higher-than-average risk for severe COVID -- but not as high as a person with lung disease or severe immune system disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RV5UZPA3VJAQVO5WBZZMT25YUY"&gt;Without vaccinations, the risk for serious, even life-threatening cases of COVID increases, and Paxlovid is not completely effective. Also, Paxlovid does not help much at preventing persistent symptoms after a COVID infection (“long COVID”). I have several patients who continue to have long COVID symptoms that are affecting their daily life, despite it being years after their initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VVGF2TH5JFBERD7VCTWPJCMQYY"&gt;Finally, it is possible that new variants of COVID will arise that are not susceptible to Paxlovid. While I have confidence that new drugs will be developed, it is far better to prevent COVID than it is to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CGV3REJKHBE4NAGN32PQZ6WH2I"&gt;COVID hasn’t gone away; it is here to stay. There will be additional “waves” of COVID infection, and during these times, it will be wise to once again bring out the surgical masks when in crowded areas, in addition to staying up-to-date with vaccines.

ROACH: Your recent discussion regarding taking an antibiotic before dental procedures for cardiac issues didn’t mention my situation. I am 86 years old, and four years ago, I had my mitral valve replaced with a porcine valve. I had no history of heart disease and never saw a cardiologist before this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="S3E2ZASMXFBFTISXJYZ2MBWPUI"&gt;I have been told to take 2,000 mg of amoxicillin one hour before any dental procedure for the rest of my life. Is this an appropriate recommendation? -- P.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KOPOELPGNBH27LHLNXMMPVGHAU"&gt;ANSWER: Although antibiotics before certain medical and dental procedures are recommended much less frequently than they were years ago, there are still instances when it is appropriate. A prosthetic valve is one of these times when antibiotics are recommended. Two grams taken orally 30-60 minutes before a dental procedure is the recommended regimen for people who can take penicillin drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ADSOQHWRANF4ROQGSQT7N4KFUY"&gt;Similarly, people with an assist device or an artificial heart should take antibiotics, as well as those with some types of congenital heart disease. Heart transplant patients with an abnormal valve and people who have had a left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device (such as the WATCHMAN) within the first six months of the device placement are also included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC7SIB43TBB3NCTTBA77VY4YQU"&gt;Dental procedures such as extractions and oral surgery are riskier than routine dental cleanings. The overall risk for all invasive dental procedures is approximately 10 cases per 10,000 without antibiotics and 4.5 cases per 10,000 with antibiotics. However, good oral hygiene and prompt treatment of any dental problems are probably more important than antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVYJTHMPQNCP7MWTEN7DHGVA4A"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

"It's hurting physicians. It's hurting medical practice. And it's hurting the American public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The horrific Arizona tragedy and how we got here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Police found Tremaure Stanley, 25, and Janiece Brooks, 26, living in a central Phoenix home where their youngest child was discovered dead in July 2023 after Brooks called 911 because their baby was unresponsive. Three surviving siblings, ages 2, 4 and 5 at the time, were subsequently hospitalized with rickets, osteopenia, vitamin D deficiency and significant developmental delays, court records show. The couple was charged with first-degree murder and four counts of child abuse. They met with prosecutors Dec. 1 to discuss a possible plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Prosecutors said the pattern of harm traces back to an extreme version of the "alkaline diet" the couple imposed on their children, combined with a growing distrust of medical care. Court records show the couple told investigators they relied on online videos and posts that warned against vaccines, &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/12/06/trump-rfk-jr-hep-b-vaccine-guidance/87640999007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;infant medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; and even common medicines such as &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/rfk-jr-tylenol-pregnant-women-autism/87127637007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;. They also avoided taking the children to doctor visits, limiting outside contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This level of insulation has become increasingly common − and it can have serious consequences, Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and executive director of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/a&gt;, told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is the 'alkaline diet'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet in particular has become a dangerous, yet widespread, piece of misinformation. The diet is based on the disproven belief that shifting the body’s acidity levels can cure diseases or "detoxify" the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For the children in Arizona, the diet entailed eating mostly vegetables, fruit and plant-based milks − with almost no protein, fats or fortified foods crucial for overall health. Court records show the couple interpreted the children’s rapid weight loss as evidence the diet was working and removing toxins, rather than a sign of medical crisis. "We chose this diet for good health," Stanley told the court at a Dec. 1 settlement conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet has made waves in the oncology community too, offering &lt;a href="/story/life/2019/01/08/dietary-advice-can-beneficial-when-comes-cancer-diagnosis/2485895002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;false hope to those with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

The truth, however, is that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8703572316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;diets don't change the pH levels&lt;/a&gt; of blood cells or tissues and that eating more alkaline foods is not a proven preventive measure or cure for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why do people fall for dangerous health claims?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Stea, a clinical psychologist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Calgary who wrote a book about pseudoscience and misinformation in the wellness industry, told USA TODAY that extreme diets often function less like trends and more like belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Arizona case in particular comes at a time when, experts say, public confidence in scientific institutions has deeply frayed.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm6pd6001w26p9bsdv8x6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical organizations and frontline health care providers are grappling with a challenge they haven’t had to face in many years: how to protect newborns against hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvzykg00073b6q8igauipw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last week, a federal advisory panel reversed its longstanding recommendation for universal vaccination at birth. Instead, the panel decided to rely on a mother’s test results for hepatitis B during pregnancy. The babies of women who test positive should still be vaccinated shortly after birth, the vaccine advisers said, and if the test is negative, parents should make a decision with their health-care provider on whether or when to vaccinate the child. Vaccinations would still be available to families who want them and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/07/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-insurance-coverage"&gt;insurance should still cover them&lt;/a&gt;, members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiysmlqq00003b6nr5gn9q1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But relying on testing recalls an approach the United States tried in the 1980s and early ’90s that still led to thousands of cases of hepatitis B among children every year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvq8rc00033b6q48iqk6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even with universal vaccination for newborns as the standard, universal testing for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/clinical-testing-guidelines.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis B during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; remained an important part of prenatal care in the United States for decades. The ACIP decision puts even more emphasis on that practice, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00073b6nih5sxgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It places a spotlight on testing,” he said. “Testing for hepatitis B virus is currently a standard part of prenatal care. It’s recommended to be tested in the first trimester or at the earliest first prenatal visit to get that answer as soon as possible. If a woman doesn’t have any prenatal care, then it’s often tested at delivery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00093b6nzcft3o3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some critics of ACIP’s decision argue that vaccinations always have been a shared decision between parents and health-care providers, and they worry that the shift could sow confusion and ultimately discourage parents from vaccinating their children altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyv5ale00053b6qr62j4d8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could mean testing carries the burden of hepatitis B prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw8xwc000h3b6qgmcukplu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing alone will not work as an approach for hepatitis B prevention, said Dr. James Campbell, a pediatrician at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases. History has shown that some women may not have access to testing or just don’t get any prenatal care. The test may be falsely negative, or mothers could become infected after they get tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw9gwb000k3b6qvvn5nduu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My worry is that more Americans will believe we no longer need to pay attention to hepatitis B in children, and we will return to the time when many babies and young children were infected every year,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000e3b6nvaiuwrb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he fears that the new ACIP recommendation could lead more parents to rely on testing alone and could dissuade them from getting their newborns the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, leaving the infant potentially vulnerable to an infection – even if they are determined to be at low risk of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000f3b6nwgsl53qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worry a little bit that this is going to send a message that it’s really not a concern and if you have your hepatitis B testing early in pregnancy and you’re not high-risk, you don’t need to do this,” said Fleischman, an associate chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale New Haven Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000g3b6n856l1yw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But even though you’re low-risk, you’re not no risk,” he said. “Even if there’s a minute risk that this could impact your baby, why wouldn’t you get this vaccine, which has for years been shown to be very safe?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000k3b6n58v8gie3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hepatitis B is a serious &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bloodborne viral infection&lt;/a&gt; that primarily attacks the liver. Many adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=For%20some%20people%2C%20hepatitis%20B,Causes" target="_blank"&gt;may clear an acute infection&lt;/a&gt; on their own, but acute infection can persist to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked with an increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000j3b6nliqlrahy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9320049/" target="_blank"&gt;first vaccines against the hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; virus were developed in the early 1980s. Around that time, ACIP recommended pre-exposure vaccination initially for people at high risk of infection, such as men who have sex with men, injection-drug users and heterosexual persons with multiple partners. Despite this recommendation, some people at high risk were still not vaccinated, and infections spread, including in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixn1trx00033b6q16gmn6zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;risk of chronic infection&lt;/a&gt; is highest among young children, with about 90% of infected infants and 30% of children infected between ages 1 to 5 estimated to remain chronically infected with hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000l3b6nmhun0u67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1988, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000036.htm" target="_blank"&gt;ACIP recommended&lt;/a&gt; that all pregnant women be screened routinely for hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000m3b6nin0igxat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A blood test is the only way to know if someone is infected, because many people with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick. They may spread the virus unknowingly, through blood or other body fluids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000n3b6n9wox9hw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But testing alone did not work as efficiently as vaccinations in preventing hepatitis B, especially in children, said pediatrician Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000o3b6n38dx1erf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Testing during pregnancy really focuses on one mode of transmission, and that’s the mother-to-baby transmission, typically around the time of birth. That testing essentially doesn’t account for those cases of exposures after birth, so those cases that may be caused by exposure from other caregivers,” Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixn3aak00053b6qa71n65ga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, hepatitis B can spread if an infected caregiver has an open cut or sore and handles a pacifier before putting it in the baby’s mouth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000p3b6nguvfbes9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The other thing is, we know that some women may fall through the cracks and not get tested, or the test may not be 100% accurate,” he said. “Some things may get missed, including making sure the testing is done or even making sure a baby is getting all the care that they need. So making sure that we get testing done is key for addressing transmission at birth, but that birth dose of vaccine gives us protection for those exposures that may come after. It really is the ultimate safety net.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000q3b6n82fuicdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By 1991, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;United States’ hepatitis B vaccination strategy had evolved&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP recommended broader efforts to eliminate transmission in the United States, with a focus on universal childhood vaccination at birth or shortly after, the prevention of mother-to-baby transmission of the virus, vaccinating adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, and catch-up vaccinations for susceptible children in high-risk populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000r3b6n0m8p6fh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the time, some pediatric-care providers were hesitant to accept the ACIP recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated. However, by 1996, efforts to educate providers and parents about hepatitis B and the benefits of vaccination led to broader acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000s3b6ndt3czvcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, from 1993 through 2000, the national coverage rate for hepatitis B vaccine among babies ages 19 to 35 months rose from 16% to 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000t3b6n93skyatc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Back when the vaccine was first introduced in the ’80s and the approach was to only vaccinate babies who were born to women with hepatitis B, you were still seeing these later cases of hepatitis B in infancy, childhood and adolescence, because there are these other sources of exposure,” Warren said. “And so that birth dose of hepatitis B helps protect babies right from the start.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000v3b6nndjd77z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The testing of pregnant women for hepatitis B has remained a “crucial part” of preventing infections among newborns, said Campbell, from the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious disease committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000w3b6nvsuddb7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are many tests available, but the one primarily being discussed in this context is hepatitis B surface antigen. It is a blood test that is quite accurate at detecting persons infected with the hepatitis virus,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmizza11w00093b6qm482i0y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This CDC advisory panel’s recommendations won’t become final until Jim O’Neill, the agency’s acting director, signs off. The CDC typically aligns with it advisers, but some doctors and lawmakers have urged O’Neill to reject their decision and maintain the recommendation for universal vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000y3b6nfme9x83c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the CDC’s recommendations are final, many medical organizations will probably re-examine their own individual guidelines for hepatitis B testing in pregnancy, said Fleischman, the ACOG president.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00103b6n5eocy11a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to probably have a conversation at our institution about do we want to consider additional hepatitis B surface antigen screening later in pregnancy,” he said. “It’s a conversation that’s probably happening among many obstetricians and hospitals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvh66j00003b6q0lbci1mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite potential changes to CDC’s recommendation, the American Academy of Pediatrics and ACOG still continue to recommend that all babies get hepatitis B vaccinations in the first day of life, even if their mothers tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00113b6n1070poce@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that after the strategy to vaccinate children at birth was introduced, the incidence of hepatitis B infections among infants and young children each year declined from roughly 16,000 cases in the early 1990s to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2023/hepatitis-b/table-2-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;fewer than 20&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00123b6nhfbujc29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got now this history that shows that when we introduce the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, that the cases of hepatitis B among infants dropped by 99%,” said Warren, of March of Dimes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00133b6nbmtbnpv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And we had not seen that before, even when there were risk-based recommendations,” he said. “This is a public health intervention that has been shown to be wildly successful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;London —&lt;/em&gt; Sperm from a donor who unknowingly carried a cancer-causing gene has been used to conceive nearly 200 babies across Europe, an investigation by 14 European public service broadcasters, including CBS News' partner network BBC News, has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some children conceived using the sperm have already died from cancer, and the vast majority of those who inherited the gene will develop cancer in their lifetimes, geneticists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man carrying the gene passed screening checks before he became a donor at the European Sperm Bank when he was a student in 2005. His sperm has been used by women trying to conceive for 17 years across multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer-causing mutation occurred in the donor's TP53 gene — which prevents cells in the body from turning cancerous —   before his birth, according to the investigation. It causes Li Fraumeni syndrome, which gives affected people a 90% chance of developing cancers, particularly during childhood, as well as breast cancer in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% of the donor's sperm contained the mutated TP53 gene. Any children conceived with affected sperm will have the dangerous mutation in every cell of their body.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a dreadful diagnosis," cancer geneticist Clare Turnbull told the BBC. "It's a very challenging diagnosis to land on a family. There is a lifelong burden of living with that risk. It's clearly devastating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How was the discovery made?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected donor sperm was discovered when doctors seeing children with cancers linked to sperm donation raised concerns at this year's European Society of Human Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, 23 children with the genetic mutation had been discovered, out of 67 children linked to the donor. Ten of those children with the mutation had already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom of Information requests submitted by journalists across multiple countries revealed at least 197 children were affected, though it is not known how many inherited the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More affected children could be discovered as more data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some children that have developed already two different cancers and some of them have already died at a very early age," Edwige Kasper, a cancer geneticist at France's Rouen University Hospital, told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Sperm Bank told CBS News that it does not ship to the United States due to U.S. regulations. A representative said the bank does work with with sperm banks in both Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the sperm get used by women all over Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor sperm was sold by the European Sperm Bank in Denmark to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations have their own regulations about how many times a donor's sperm can be used domestically, but there is no international law restricting how many times a donor's sperm can be used worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that some national laws were breached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Belgium, where sperm from a single donor is supposed to be used by a maximum of six families, 53 children were born to 38 different women using sperm from the donor with the genetic mutation, the investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;

What’s interesting is I can’t remember ‘stopping’ doing the technique, because obviously I’m falling asleep while doing it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s used it both to fall asleep initially and after waking up in the middle of the night. “I may not be able to fix waking up 10+ times per night, but certainly falling back asleep faster is a game-changer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results aren’t always that dramatic, though.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a new mom juggling a business, Morissa Schwartz will try any viral sleep hack that promises rest. “Rolling my eyes upward while keeping my eyelids closed created a mild sense of relaxation, almost like a physical cue telling my brain, ‘We’re done here,‘” she said. It didn’t knock her out instantly, but “it did shorten the ‘lying-awake-overanalyzing-my-to-do-list’ phase.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But not everyone had the same experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For some people, it didn’t just fail ― it made things worse. Erika Lavin has dealt with insomnia since third grade, managing it with medication and melatonin. Every few weeks, though, anxiety breaks through and she wakes up with a panic attack. When this happened one night, she decided to try the eye rolling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I tried doing the eye roll hack and then added in box breathing, but I could feel the eye movement making me feel more and more awake,” she said. “It felt like the eye movements were feeding into my panic rather than counteracting it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She kept at it for 10 minutes, thinking maybe she needed more time. The next night, she tried again without the panic attack. Same result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I felt like it was waking me up that night as well even though I wasn’t panicked.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Denise Murray tracked the method with her smartwatch over a two-week trial, the data showed her heart rate went up, not down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The initial feeling this gave me was more awareness of my body, like the pressure of my eyeballs; I could also hear my heartbeat,” she said. Worse, her “mind switched from sleepy to analytical, thinking of campaign spreadsheets or meetings.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By night 10, it was taking her nearly double the time to fall back asleep. She quit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After speaking with these people, I also figured it was time to test this myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first night felt weird. The rolling motions felt unnatural, and my eyes ached a bit. After several repetitions, I did drift off quicker than usual, about 15 minutes instead of my typical hour-plus. The second night brought similar results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was thrilled. Finally, a free solution! No more bankrupting myself on sleep gadgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That euphoria was short-lived. Over the next week and a half, the technique stopped working. Most nights, I’d give up, frustrated, and feel more awake. By week two, I was back on my couch at 3 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My overall take? Out of two weeks of testing, it genuinely helped maybe three times. When it worked, it shaved 30 minutes off my wake times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you're constantly fatigued and can't get to sleep, it's important to talk to a doctor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, should you try it the next time you can’t sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, it’s low-risk and free. Just keep your expectations realistic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you decide to test it out, keep a few things in mind. Keep the movements slow and gentle ― don’t force your eyes into extreme positions. If you have any existing eye conditions, such as glaucoma or retinal issues, check with your doctor first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s the critical part: “If it isn’t working after a few minutes, it’s time to try something else and/or get out of bed,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sarichaitphd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="clinical psychologist Sari Chait" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69370821e4b013f1f7d25b0b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.sarichaitphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;clinical psychologist Sari Chait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who specializes in treating insomnia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why? Because lying in bed awake trains your brain to associate your bed with being awake, making future sleep harder. Clearly, I need to take her advice and move to the living room sooner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m not convinced my first two nights were anything more than a placebo. But even modest improvement matters when you’ve been an insomniac for a decade.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It works for some, fails for others, and might offer mild help for people like me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just don’t expect miracles. That only happens on TikTok.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPeEx3VUpmM2lhTGxzRUFMX1czeTVhNU4zaURWV0hVbzUyZmFZanZJYVVHOHJxTC1HMGhqVzBXWUlQTzdBTEkxSEtZT0g0aWhQV0IwWkFPVDkza1ByUjQwSDIxS2d0NFZvUEhjSmhYanhFUjViZk5KSkVTbEZjUFdmczQtY3hxOGxSZmtCTk5mbTXSAZYBQVVfeXFMTjBUNUlodVUxc0RPVnUzZGpWOW9Rd2t5Mkhrc1U3UDRRMS1qd2Y1Q01OdzVtQ29rS3JpLWRpUDVxdm4tN2dBNUxJTlcybFlCVXNsY2ZOcVdPdXVtLVUzQWozM0tCZWdrQzNsNk9WdnBkZlBYaXZJaDNXcjBMc2gyX1UyakVVeURjR2twenlwUlVIdFNNamN3</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：捐赠者被臭鼬抓伤后，男子从器官移植中感染狂犬病- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/diagnostic-dilemma-man-caught-rabies-from-organ-transplant-after-donor-was-scratched-by-skunk</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;
&lt;p id="0b4c89c1-46df-4315-808e-e041c47e11fd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A man in Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The man received a left kidney transplant in an Ohio hospital, and about five weeks later, he began experiencing tremors, weakness in his lower extremities and urinary incontinence, as well as confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0b4c89c1-46df-4315-808e-e041c47e11fd-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;About a week after these initial symptoms emerged, the man was hospitalized with additional health problems, including fever and difficulty swallowing. He also developed hydrophobia, or an irrational fear of water. Once hospitalized, he required breathing support with a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="773a33f8-78c9-40ee-8d95-4c5938fbca6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The man's doctors suspected that his signs and symptoms indicated a rabies infection, so they consulted the Ohio Department of Health and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the case. Various clinical samples from the patient were sent to the CDC for testing and ultimately came back positive for rabies RNA, the genetic material of the virus, as well as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Within a week of being hospitalized, the patient died of his infection. Once a rabies infection is established, there is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351826#treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351826#treatment" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no effective cure available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

As such, rabies is nearly always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(People who suspect they may have been exposed to rabies — for example, after being bitten by an animal — can be treated with anti-rabies antibodies or vaccines to help prevent the virus from triggering an infection in the first place. This preventative treatment is very effective.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;This man's rabies infection — the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first reported in Michigan in about 15 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was suspected to be potentially linked to his organ transplant, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7439a1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM151122&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20December%204%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM151122" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7439a1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM151122&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20December%204%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM151122" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators had ruled out direct animal exposure as the source of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rUR3kF2PAykgSsTcwuEQkL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rUR3kF2PAykgSsTcwuEQkL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about the suspected infection, the CDC and state- and local-level partners launched an investigation into possible contamination of the donor kidney. The donor had been from Idaho and the investigators got in touch with the donor's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that "in late October 2024, a skunk approached the donor as he held a kitten in an outbuilding on his rural property," the report says. "During an encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the donor sustained a shin scratch that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten. According to the family, the donor attributed the skunk’s behavior to predatory aggression toward the kitten."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five weeks after being scratched, the donor began experiencing symptoms consistent with rabies, including confusion, difficulty swallowing, hallucinations and a stiff neck, a family member said. He then fell unconscious at home and didn't wake up, though he was resuscitated and hospitalized. He was declared &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and removed from life support five days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ac052f48-bf6e-4ac9-9734-cfa673f96ec5"&gt;Notably, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic conditions, not to rabies. That said, they took various clinical samples from the patient that the CDC then retroactively tested for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biopsy from the donor's right kidney tested positive, but there wasn't a big enough sample from the left kidney to test. Nonetheless, this supported the idea that the donor kidney was likely the source of the Michigan man's rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978," the case report noted. "However, the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is low." In short, this chain of events is very unlikely, and hospitals follow extensive protocols to safeguard against transplanting infected organs into patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="ab11e4d2-3ccd-41f3-8546-9baf4bdf6b3e"&gt;

These games took a lot of energy. But if I play a normal human match, my opponent would also be exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_23373484.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why thinking hard makes us feel tired&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;machine intelligence&lt;/a&gt; can keep running as long as it has a power supply, a human brain will become fatigued — and you don’t have to be a chess grandmaster to understand the feeling. Anyone can end up drained after a long day of work, at school or juggling the countless decisions of daily life. This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mental exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; can sap motivation, dull focus and erode judgement. It can raise the odds of careless mistakes. Especially when combined with sleep loss or circadian disruption, cognitive fatigue can also contribute to deadly medical errors and road traffic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was partly Kasparov’s weary comments that inspired Mathias Pessiglione, a cognitive neuroscientist and research director at the Paris Brain Institute, to study the tired brain. He wanted to know: “Why is this cognitive system prone to fatigue?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians have long struggled to define, measure and treat cognitive fatigue — relying mostly on self-reports of how tired someone says they feel. Now, however, scientists from across disciplines are enlisting innovative experimental approaches and biological markers to probe the metabolic roots and consequences of cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efforts are getting a boost in attention and funding in large part because of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, which afflicts roughly 6 in every 100 people after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, says Vikram Chib, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “The primary symptom of long COVID is fatigue,” says Chib. “I think that has opened a lot of people’s eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib and others hope that a fundamental understanding of cognitive fatigue will help the billions of people who face it from time to time, as well as the tens of millions who carry it as a more extreme and chronic companion. As well as being common in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, debilitating fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS)&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme mental exhaustion can also follow cancer treatment, head injury, stroke or exposure to certain toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatigue is a really big problem,” says Chib. “We really need to figure this out — how to study it and how to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cognitive fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of a chess match, a professional player might rely on well-rehearsed openings. “The first five, six or seven moves can be done without thinking,” says Pessiglione. But when there’s an unfamiliar position on the board, the player no longer has a ready routine. They are “required to think”, he says. The same is true for a driver who turns on to an unfamiliar street. On roads they’ve been down hundreds of times, mental autopilot can kick in. But if they take an unknown route, Pessiglione says, the demands on the brain intensify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is the term that scientists give to this effortful directing and regulating of thought. Over time, as a leading theory goes, maintaining control becomes costly for the brain, and fatigue emerges. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some think it is related to how cells cope when their energy supply is strained; others point to a build-up of toxins from neural activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But researchers tend to agree that the sensation of fatigue is protective — a warning that the brain is nearing a physiological boundary and it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Fans watch a chess game between Garry Kasparov — shown on a TV monitor — and Deep Blue." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;During chess matches in 1996 and 1997, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov grew tired, unlike his opponent, IBM’s Deep Blue computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Stan Honda/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular players across several brain regions might be involved, scientists say. Researchers have found potential links between cognitive fatigue and changing levels of metabolites such as glucose and lactate, neurochemical messengers such as glutamate and adenosine, and a protein involved in learning and memory called brain-derived neurotrophic factor&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Even amyloid-β, a protein fragment associated with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, might contribute by disrupting synapses, interfering with the clearance of glutamate or increasing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But it is uncertain what is a marker and what is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscientist Clay Holroyd at Ghent University in Belgium is among the researchers who favour the toxic-build-up theory of cognitive fatigue. This idea has been gaining traction over the past five years or so, although it’s not yet clear what the waste metabolite is. He likens the sensation of fatigue to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;: both have a role in protecting the body from accumulating damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if a person ignores the sensation at first, he says, there’s little risk of real metabolic harm in most cases. “We have an automatic fail-safe,” he says. “You can work really, really, really hard for a time, but eventually you’re going to need to go to sleep.” Although taking a break from a task can offer temporary relief, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sleep has a much more restorative role&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep, especially slow-wave deep sleep, acts as the brain’s nightly maintenance. It clears out metabolic debris and recalibrates circuits and cells so that they can best use energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seeking better measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, cognitive fatigue has been quantified either by asking a person to report their own levels of fatigue or by detecting a change in their performance on working-memory tests or other tasks. These are not great measurements, scientists say. Drops in performance can be obscured by factors such as motivation, boredom and frustration. Performance can also be offset by training, such as when a chess player automates a sequence of moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reports, meanwhile, are subjective and unreliable. “People are terrible judges of their own fatigue,” says Daniel Forger, a researcher in computational medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who is investigating new ways to assess cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03904-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51809464.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Long-COVID research just got a big funding boost: will it find new treatments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand fatigue, Pessiglione, Chib and other researchers are trying to bridge an understanding of its biochemical workings with how it affects &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The current hypothesis: cognitive fatigue arises from metabolic changes in parts of the brain that are responsible for cognitive control. And those changes, whether resulting from depleted energy stores or amassed waste, alter how brain circuits weigh the costs and benefits of exerting mental effort — nudging decisions towards easier options that are more immediately rewarding&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Pessiglione and his team simulated a workday by asking otherwise healthy participants to spend several hours on either easy or hard versions of the same cognitive tasks. In one task, participants viewed letters appearing one after another on a screen and had to decide whether each new letter matched one a certain number of letters earlier. Recalling whether the letter on screen matched the third letter back, for example, would be much more difficult than recalling whether it matched the first letter back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this simulated workday, participants made choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed ones. Those who had completed the harder tasks were more likely to opt for instant gratification. That preference was also consistent with greater accumulation of glutamate — one of the metabolites suspected to build up with cognitive exertion — in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain region is involved in executive functions, such as working memory and decision-making, and has been found to have lower activity after a hard day of simulated work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Apps, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that the dynamics of dopamine — which interacts closely with adenosine, glutamate and other metabolic players in the brain — might help to explain the connection between neurometabolic strain and the experience of fatigue. Because dopamine enhances the perceived value of rewards, it typically boosts motivation to invest effort. He proposes that sustained effort might cause dopamine levels to drop, leaving people less willing to work for the same pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these and similar lines of research are starting to reveal how levels of these molecules and measures of brain activity align with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, says Chib, is that there is “something happening with the chemistry of your brain” that changes your calculation on whether you should exert cognitive effort. He says that baseline chemistry will differ between people: “You and I might have different concentrations of neurotransmitters in our brain, and that inherent difference could make me feel very tired, whereas you’re able to persist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793258.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First proposed blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome: what scientists think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These, or similar differences in chemistry, might help to explain chronic and other extreme fatigue. In people with long COVID or ME/CFS, a small mental task can feel as intimidating as performing brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ana Lia Tamariz, an artist and health-and-wellness coach in Miami, Florida, who has ME/CFS, simply listening to music or reading a book often requires immense effort. “Sometimes, I cannot read one more word,” she says. “Imagine coming out of anaesthesia from a surgical procedure groggy. Imagine you never exit that state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her, the cognitive and physical fatigue can be hard to separate. Any cognitively demanding task can make her physically drained, she says. And anything physically demanding can leave her mentally spent. Tamariz says she is constantly doing the calculation: “Is this worth my energy?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports the idea that some shared mechanisms might drive both physical and cognitive fatigue, and that the two interact&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “If you run a marathon, yes, there is physical fatigue in your body,” says Apps. “But by God, you’re going to feel all kinds of cognitive fatigue as well from the strain and the concentration that’s required to maintain your performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverse also seems to be true. In a preprint from last year, Chib’s team found that otherwise healthy participants were less willing to exert physical effort after performing a mentally taxing task&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers are studying the roles of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, circadian rhythms and inflammation in cognitive fatigue, as well as the consequences. When the brain doesn’t get restorative sleep, small clusters of neurons can go briefly offline. These local sleep-like episodes can cause momentary lapses in attention and other slips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Parents can also be more intentional about challenging sexist assumptions in the home. Not least since, when men show hostility towards women, which has been dubbed "hostile masculinity", it &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has been linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased incidences of violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On a societal level, policy measures can help address these imbalances, such as providing paid family leave for all workers, men and women alike. This has been successfully implemented in several Nordic countries, where a paid "use it or lose it" approach &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210712-paternity-leave-the-hidden-barriers-keeping-men-at-work" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has increased the number of men taking parental leave&lt;/a&gt;. This in turn normalises and values caregiving and with more support at home, helps keep women more closely tied to the workforce, limiting the economic damage. When men take on more care at home, the very idea of what masculinity is can change and evolve over time, to one that includes caring and better supports women, even developing a different sense of what it can mean to be a man, which has been dubbed "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X15576203" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;caring masculinities&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When women are empowered, it benefits all of society, explains Homan, as women in power tend to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10918039/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;invest more heavily in health care, public health, education, welfare and social safety&lt;/a&gt; programmes that can improve the health of the wider population. "Conversely, greater structural sexism leads to reduced public investment in these areas, harming everyone, including men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And finally, openly talking about the consequences of sexism can help raise awareness of the harms involved. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2480" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;There is even evidence&lt;/a&gt; that speaking out about unwanted discrimination is beneficial for mental health, as it can lead to more support.

I have worked in outbreak zones, in understaffed hospitals, in field units built out of necessity. I’ve seen firsthand how vaccines transform the trajectory of a disease, a community, and a country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But nothing has prepared me for the exam room conversations I’m having now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the rise of anti-science and anti-vaccine rhetoric has fundamentally changed the relationship between clinicians and patients. It has made routine preventive care feel like walking into an ideological minefield. Increasingly, it is making it harder and sometimes nearly impossible to protect patients’ health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my clinic, I can feel it before I even speak. With approximately half of my patients, when I bring up vaccines, a tension settles into the room. I see the stiffening of posture, the guarded expression, the subtle shift that says: &lt;em&gt;I’ve already made up my mind&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes patients shut down immediately; other times they start asking me a barrage of questions fueled by the misinformation they have been exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not a disagreement grounded in evidence. It is not a conversation between two people weighing risks and benefits. It is a wall — thick, immovable, and rapidly rising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There has always been some vaccine hesitancy. But what we are experiencing now is something different: entrenched, identity-driven opposition fueled by misinformation, political polarization, and deliberate disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no longer: “I’m nervous” or “I am unsure, can we talk through it?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s: “I don’t believe anything you’re about to say.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a physician, this dynamic is devastating. My job is to protect patients. However, when basic conversations about influenza, measles, Covid-19, or hepatitis B become confrontational before they even begin, it limits my ability to deliver safe, evidence-based care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. today, trust in institutions and public health has eroded so profoundly that many people trust strangers on social media more than clinicians who have cared for them for years. Since these narratives are crafted to provoke fear and sow doubt, they stick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians don’t often talk about the emotional toll of these interactions. But it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I find myself feeling nervous and uncertain before routine discussions that should take seconds. I rehearse what I’m going to say in my mind to anticipate potential landmines. I worry about appearing pushy or triggering defensiveness. I try to determine whether the patient in front of me is willing to hear any scientific information at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I should not feel nervous about mentioning a vaccine that prevents cervical cancer.&lt;br&gt;I should not have to brace myself before recommending a tetanus booster. And I should not walk into a room wondering whether decades of training and years of caring for a patient will be dismissed because of something they saw on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet this is where we are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are not abstract to me. I have seen what happens when communities do not have access to them. I have held the hands of patients dying from diseases that vaccines could have prevented, like tetanus, influenza, and hepatitis. I have worked in wards where infections ripped through families simply because lifesaving interventions arrived too late. I have stood in Ebola treatment units and witnessed the tragic devastation of a virus before an effective vaccine existed — and I have seen the countless lives now saved because &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/07/inside-story-scientists-produced-world-first-ebola-vaccine/"&gt;we finally have one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When patients reject vaccines today, they are rejecting one of the most powerful tools we have to keep them safe, not because the science has changed, but because the information ecosystem has.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That should terrify us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are watching measles, a disease the U.S. eliminated decades ago, roar back to the point where we may soon lose our elimination status. We are watching preventable hospitalizations rise, placing increased strain on health systems and physicians still recovering from the toll of Covid-19. And we are watching public health progress unravel because misinformation now spreads faster and more effectively than truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors are doing everything they can, yet many of us feel increasingly exhausted, disillusioned, and isolated. I hear this constantly from colleagues across infectious diseases, primary care, pediatrics, and public health. We are all carrying the same weight and spending our days trying to counter fear and fiction while public trust erodes. The emotional toll is profound — moral injury from trying to protect patients but being unable to break through the disinformation shaping their choices, burnout from debating the facts repeatedly, and sadness from watching preventable illnesses occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians cannot sustain this alone. We cannot compete with the volume, speed, and emotional manipulation of modern disinformation, especially when we are undermined by institutions, politicians, and influencers who benefit from chaos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect both patients and the clinicians trying to care for them, we need action:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger federal communication that is science-based rather than politically driven&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media platforms must de-incentivize disinformation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public health agencies empowered to communicate clearly and consistently&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Political leaders who stop weaponizing vaccines for partisan gain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Training and education for health workers and public health officials on how to engage in effective and informative vaccine conversations with patients and the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians also need protection both emotionally and professionally. We need institutional support for scientific communication and leadership willing to publicly back clinicians when attacks come. Individual resilience is not enough, and no amount of well-being apps or mindfulness can offset the systemic erosion of trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This moment also carries serious medium- and long-term consequences for the medical workforce. The next generation is watching how physicians and public health professionals are being treated. They are witnessing expertise dismissed, harassment normalized, and burnout accepted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It should not surprise us that recruitment is suffering. Infectious diseases &lt;a href="https://www.nrmp.org/about/news/2025/12/nrmp-celebrates-results-for-the-2025-medicine-and-pediatric-specialties-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fellowship match rates continue to fall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/~/link/2d3059dd8f364a3cb1af882b5c10276e.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than 50% of ID fellowship programs&lt;/a&gt; went unfilled in 2025. This is not just a training issue, it is an early warning signal for a future shortage at a time when complex infections, immunocompromised patients, global outbreaks, and antimicrobial resistant are all increasing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a patient shuts down the moment they hear the word “vaccine,” it’s a sign the system has already failed them. When fear wins over evidence, people become more vulnerable to diseases we know how to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when clinicians walk into exam rooms hesitant to even raise the topic of vaccination, we inch toward a public health landscape shaped not by science, but by noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this continues, outbreaks will worsen, preventable deaths will rise, and clinicians will continue to burn out under the weight of trying to protect patients who have been taught to distrust them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not sustainable — and it is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silence got us here. Leadership must get us out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That provocative idea is at the heart of work led by Professor Indraneel Mittra at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is not completely new. In 1986, an article in the &lt;em&gt;New Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; by Dr. Harold Dvorak suggested that cancer behaves very much like a wound that never heals. Cancer and chronic wounds share many biological features, and Professor Mittra argues that, rather than always trying to destroy tumors, medicine should explore ways to help them move toward a healed, less aggressive state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study involving people with glioblastoma, one of the most feared brain cancers, his team reports that a simple combination of two low-cost nutraceuticals appears to support exactly this kind of healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing a Gentle Strategy in Glioblastoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a fast-growing, highly aggressive brain tumor. Even with modern treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, used alone or together, patients typically survive a median of only about 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;BJC Reports&lt;/em&gt;, Professor Mittra and colleagues enrolled ten patients with glioblastoma and asked them to take a tablet containing small amounts of two nutraceuticals, resveratrol and copper. They took this tablet four times a day for an average of 11.6 days before their scheduled brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of ten patients, whose tumors were similarly aggressive but who did not receive resveratrol and copper, served as the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During surgery, the team collected brain tumor samples from both groups. These samples were then examined in detail using microscopy, immune-staining, immunofluorescence and transcriptome analysis to see how the tumors differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyses showed that the nutraceutical tablets had a striking effect on tumor biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dramatic Changes Inside the Tumors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several key cancer markers shifted in a favorable direction in patients who received the resveratrol and copper tablets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Average levels of the protein Ki-67, a widely used indicator of how quickly glioblastoma cells are dividing, were almost one third lower in treated tumors than in untreated ones. This suggests the cancer was growing less aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Biomarkers associated with nine major "hallmarks of cancer" were present in 57% fewer cells in the treated samples.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Levels of six immune checkpoints, proteins that normally prevent the immune system from attacking cancer cells, were on average 41% lower in the treated tumors.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Three markers linked to stem cells, which may help tumors spread and resist treatment, were 56% lower in the treated group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the patients who took the nutraceutical tablets did not experience any side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic nutraceutical tablet potentially has the power to heal glioblastoma," said Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Cell-Free Chromatin Particles (cfChPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might this apparent healing happen at the cellular level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Mittra, the key action involves resveratrol and copper acting on cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) (cfChPs) that circulate in the body. These are fragments of DNA released from dying cancer cells that can worsen the behavior of surviving cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work from his group showed that when resveratrol and copper are combined, they generate oxygen radicals that deactivate or destroy cfChPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers found that cfChPs were abundant in tissue taken from untreated tumors, but were almost completely absent from tissue taken from tumors in patients who had received the nutraceutical tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that dead cancer cells in the treated group were removed through apoptosis, a controlled cell death process, before they could release cfChPs into the surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mittra explains: "The cell-free chromatin particles, fragments of DNA released by dying cancer cells, inflame the surviving cancer cells. This makes the disease more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you eliminate the cell-free chromatin, which is what the resveratrol-copper tablets do, the cancer is subdued."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that with longer-term use, this approach might possibly lead to complete healing of the cancer, effectively turning a malignant tumor into a benign one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Checkpoints and a Low Cost Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable findings from the study is that the resveratrol-copper tablets reduced the activity of several immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoint inhibition has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy, because blocking these proteins can unleash the immune system against tumors. However, current immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs are extremely expensive and can cause significant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the nutraceutical combination used in this study is simple, non-toxic and inexpensive, yet still appears to downregulate multiple immune checkpoints. This raises the possibility of a more accessible way to influence some of the same pathways targeted by costly cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Potential Shift in Cancer Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach to treating cancer has begun to emerge from these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have been trying to kill cancer cells for 2,500 years, since the time of the ancient Greeks, without success," says Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it is time to look at cancer treatment differently and work towards healing tumors, rather than annihilating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course, the number of patients in this study was rather small. However, the results were so striking that I'd fully expect them to be replicated in a larger sample of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe that we may be on the brink of transforming the way cancer is treated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, through its grant CTCTMC to the Tata Memorial Centre awarded to Indraneel Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the line, she said, was the head of the fertility department at a Belgian clinic she had visited in 2011 to undergo fertility treatment, which at the time was not available to would-be single mothers in France. After her daughter was successfully conceived, she said, she had never heard from the clinic again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caller told her that the sperm donor she had used to conceive her daughter carried a rare &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/genetics-and-genomics/t-69899904"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; mutation of the TP53 gene, which suppresses cancerous growth. The mutation is linked to a heightened and lifelong risk of multiple &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; — many of which can develop at a very early age. The caller said her daughter had a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, for which there is no cure or treatment. It was, she was told, "urgent" for her to screen her daughter for the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a shock," said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. "I didn't understand anything." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would soon learn that her daughter did indeed carry the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, after the mutation was detected in his samples, the donor had been permanently blocked in October 2023 by the European Sperm Bank (ESB), which had sold the sperm. Though the clinic maintains that it contacted the woman "as soon as possible," it told her she received the call a year and a half after the ESB discovered the mutation because it had migrated its computer system and initially lost her contact details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sperm donor 7069&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated by the EBU Investigative Journalism Network, an investigation by DW and several other European public broadcasters reveals that, for more than 15 years, women in at least 14 countries in Europe and elsewhere were sold sperm from donor 7069. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035217" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035217_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A sperm bank is viewed from the outside: a red-brick building with bikes parked in front"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The ESB exported donor 7069's sperm to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Iceland to Albania and beyond, at least 197 children were conceived with donor 7069's sperm, the investigation shows. It is possible that the number is far higher — the ESB has yet to disclose the total number of children conceived with his sperm. And so doctors are unable to say whether all of them have even been tested at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a rare and potentially fatal genetic mutation was sold to families across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the donor-conceived children have already developed two different sorts of cancer; others "have already died," said Edwige Kasper, a biologist who specializes in genetic predispositions to cancer. She is counseling some of the affected families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, the sperm bank has the obligation to alert all fertility clinics to which it exported gametes of any genetic abnormalities that arise. The clinics, in turn, inform parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet DW and its partners have learned of several cases of families who were never officially informed that their children might be carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'A big frustration'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorte Kellermann, a single mother who lives in Denmark, said she learned about the case in November 2023 from another parent who had used the donor. She told DW and its partners that she had not been contacted by either the sperm bank or the fertility clinic she had used. And, she said, she was aware of other families — single mothers who had used the same donor, and who had connected via a private Facebook group. The former director of the clinic Kellermann had used said he could not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though DW is unable to verify each of the Facebook group's accounts, they are consistent with those of doctors and reports issued by health authorities across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz, who specializes in hereditary cancers, told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, one of DW's partners in the investigation, that several of her patients in Sweden had never been contacted. She said they had only found out about the mutation through media reports. It was, she said, "a big frustration." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035287" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035287_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz sits in her office, wearing glasses, a blue shirt and a lanyard"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Svetlana Lagercrantz and other doctors say early cancer detection is essential to saving lives&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it took a gathering of hereditary cancer experts in 2024 to realize the extent of the problem. Lagercrantz said a French colleague was talking about patients who had inherited the TP53 mutation from their sperm donor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, she said, doctors from across Europe realized that what they had assumed were singular cases were in fact all fathered by one single donor — spanning the continent and even beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It left her "shaken." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lifelong screening&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy concerns, the ESB has so far refused to provide the exact number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035233" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035233_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="plates on a building identify the offices of the European Sperm Bank"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The European Sperm Bank has refused to provide the exact number of donor 7069's offspring&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since we don't know how many women have children with the donor, you keep thinking: But is there one more child?" Lagercrantz said. For her and her colleagues, it is "hard to let go of that thought." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are found to carry the mutation have to undergo regular and lifelong checkups. As cancer is particularly rare in children, she said, symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted when doctors are not aware of the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earlier you detect the cancer, the better the chance you have to cure it," she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs as early as 2020&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESB's website resembles a dating site, allowing potential clients to browse donor profiles and — for an extra fee — hear audio interviews and view childhood photos. Clients can fork over almost €1,000 ($1,165) for a more comprehensive genetic test than the routine tests sperm is required to undergo in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DW and its partners came across donor 7069's online profile first listed as early as 2007: "Kjeld," a tall white man with light brown hair and brown eyes who was listed as an "M.S. Economy Student." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first warning came in 2020, according to the ESB, when the bank received a notification that a child conceived with Kjeld's sperm had been diagnosed as carrying the TP53 mutation. His sperm was placed under quarantine until further genetic testing.​ ​The results came back negative, as the rare mutation occurs only in some of the donor's sperm cells. The donor himself showed no symptoms. And his sperm was returned to the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the ESB was informed of another child carrying the TP53 mutation. A new round of testing found that the mutation was indeed present in a portion of the donor's sperm. This prompted a permanent ban — and phone calls to parents across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No Europe-wide cap on donor offspring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in Copenhagen, the ESB has emerged as a major player in the global fertility trade, claiming to export sperm to countries across Europe and as far away as Afghanistan and Bolivia. In 2023, the ESB, which is owned by the private investment firm Perwyn, made more than 60 million Danish kroners, or about €8 million, in profit, a significant increase from the 35 million Danish kroners that it had made the previous year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Solo parent by choice" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Solo parent by choice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-60456992" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="60456992" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/60450931_605.webp" data-duration="04:34"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_,sd_sor,sd_avc,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_sd_avc.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business is a lucrative and rapidly growing one as more medical procedures become available and women opt to have children later in life, sometimes on their own or with same-sex partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, donors, who typically donate once a week for six to 18 months, receive €80 per donation, the head of a sperm bank told DW. Their sperm is then washed, analyzed and packaged in so-called straws, longish tubes that are frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each straw sells for €1,000. Becoming &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pregnancy/t-64950283"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive and potentially protracted process: Though some women only need one or two tries, many might need 10 or more — and some never manage to conceive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fertility industry is governed by a patchwork of rules and regulations. Some countries place an age limit on treatments or only allow them for married heterosexual couples. Some allow procedures that are banned in other countries. Some allow anonymous donations of sperm and eggs, which others ban. German patients, for example, may travel to Spain for egg donations, which &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/german-doctors-want-human-egg-donations-to-be-legalized/a-49057057"&gt;are illegal in their home country&lt;/a&gt;; same-sex couples from Poland may travel to Germany for treatments they are denied back home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries place legal limits on the number of children born from one single donor. Others, like Germany, do not, but banks tend to follow industry guidelines of 15 families per donor. Though the European Union passed new regulations on medically assisted reproduction and substances of human origin in 2024, these do not include an EU-wide cap on the number of children born to a single donor. There is currently no international database that tracks donors and prevents them from selling sperm to several banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="71835727" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/71835727_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="a magnified image of sperm as viewed through a microscope"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Donor sperm undergoes medical tests, yet TP53 is not included in the routine tests&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: David Spears/Mary Evans/IMAGO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential donors undergo extensive medical tests, and only a single-digit percentage &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/mobile-phones-might-cause-lower-sperm-count/a-67287821"&gt;make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. The process does not include screening for rare genetic mutations such as TP53. Having invested heavily in a donor, sperm banks have an economic incentive to maximize profit by selling each donor's sperm to several families. ​​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its website, the ESB claims to have set a self-imposed cap on the number of families per donor: "The majority of our donors have a limit of 75 families, but in selected markets (the UK, Ireland, Australia and the Netherlands) we also offer donors with a worldwide limit of 25 families." For an extra fee, prospective buyers can limit the number of families; €39,000 buys exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research by DW and its partners shows that the at least 197 children conceived with donor 7069's sperm clearly exceeded the ESB's own stated polices, as well as national limits in some cases. In Belgium alone, 53 children were conceived using the donor's sperm,​ ​despite national laws that set a limit of six women per donor. This has prompted investigations by Belgian authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-74839704" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="74839704" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/74821788_605.webp" data-duration="26:04"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronted with the findings, the ESB wrote: "We are deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor. They have our deepest sympathy." The ESB "tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately," the ESB wrote in its statement, "we have identified that the limits for how many families a donor can be used for have been exceeded in some countries both in the specific case regarding TP53 and in other cases. This is partly due to inadequate reporting from the clinics, non-robust systems and fertility tourism." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her laboratory in central Berlin, Ann-Kathrin Klym did a double take when she heard the number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. It is, she said, "enormous." Klym heads the laboratory at the Berliner Samenbank, a sperm bank that, with its 10 employees, is a minor player compared with the ESB. Klym showed DW the bank's storage room: big, bulky containers filled with liquid nitrogen, which freezes the sperm. When she removed a lid to show the small straws with frozen sperm housed in each, whitish-grey nitrogen gas swirled out of the tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035269" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035269_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="gloved hand pulls tube, or straw, of semen from a container featuring several such tubes"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Sperm is stored in liquid nitrogen. &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klym said her bank limited donors to 15 families and asked them to sign a declaration that they had not sold sperm to another bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People conceived with donor sperm and their parents are calling for Europe-wide and indeed global caps on the number of children born to one donor. Spenderkinder, an association of donor-conceived children in Germany, told DW that it advocates for a global cap of six families per donor, as well as a global registry of donors. That would also make it easier to find and contact families in a timely manner should sperm banks become aware of diseases and mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'I feel enormous guilt'&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother in France who received the call back in June has since learned that her now-teenage daughter did inherit the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, she and her daughter continue to grapple with what the diagnosis will mean: a lifetime of regular checks and the constant fear of what they might reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she harbored "absolutely no ill feelings" for donor 7069, whose sperm had been sold to scores of families across the continent by the European Sperm Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, she said, he had not known that he was a carrier of the mutation: "He is not to blame." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she said, "I feel enormous guilt — to know that because you chose to conceive that way, you have passed on something that is potentially life-threatening." It is, she added, "very, very hard." &lt;/p&gt;

His sperm was then used by women for around 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is healthy and passed the donor screening checks. However, the DNA in some of his cells mutated before he was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It damaged the TP53 gene – which has the crucial role of preventing the body's cells turning cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most of the donor's body does not contain the dangerous form of TP53, but up to 20% of his sperm do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, any children made from affected sperm will have the mutation in every cell of their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is known as Li Fraumeni syndrome and comes with an up to 90% chance of developing cancer, particularly during childhood as well as breast cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It is a dreadful diagnosis," Prof Clare Turnbull, a cancer geneticist at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, told the BBC.

However, individual countries do set their own limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Sperm Bank accepted these limits had "unfortunately" been breached in some countries and it was "in dialogue with the authorities in Denmark and Belgium".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In Belgium, a single sperm donor is only supposed to be used by six families. Instead 38 different women produced 53 children to the donor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK limit is 10 families per donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'You can't screen for everything'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Allan Pacey, who used to run the Sheffield Sperm Bank and is now the deputy vice president of the Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health at the University of Manchester, said countries had become dependent on big international sperm banks and half the UK's sperm was now imported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He told the BBC: "We have to import from big international sperm banks who are also selling it to other countries, because that's how they make their money, and that is where the problem begins, because there's no international law about how often you can use the sperm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said the case was "awful" for everybody involved, but it would be impossible to make sperm completely safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"You can't screen for everything, we only accept 1% or 2% of all men that apply to be a sperm donor in the current screening arrangement so if we make it even tighter, we wouldn't have any sperm donors – that's where the balance lies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This case, alongside that of a man who was ordered to stop after fathering 550 children through sperm donation, has again raised questions over whether there should be tougher limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has recently suggested a limit of 50 families per donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, it said this would not reduce the risk of inheriting rare genetic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rather, it would be better for the wellbeing of children who discover they are one of hundreds of half-siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"More needs to be done to reduce the number of families that are born globally from the same donors," said Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust, an independent charity for people affected by infertility and genetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We don't fully understand what the social and psychological implications will be of having these hundreds of half siblings. It can potentially be traumatic," she told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Sperm Bank said: "It is important, especially in light of this case, to remember that thousands of women and couples do not have the opportunity to have a child without the help of donor sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It is generally safer to have a child with the help of donor sperm if the sperm donors are screened according to medical guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What if you are considering using a sperm donor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sarah Norcross said these cases were "vanishingly rare" when you consider the number of children born to a sperm donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;All of the experts we spoke to said using a licensed clinic meant the sperm would be screened for more diseases than most fathers-to-be are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Pacey said he would ask "is this a UK donor or is this a donor from somewhere else?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If it's a donor from somewhere else I think it's legitimate to ask questions about has that donor been used before?

So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’ve never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi said. “He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man’s blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups,” Coyle said. “This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man’s blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” the man told his doctors. “(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combinations of ingredients ‘cause havoc’&lt;br&gt; It’s not just high levels of caffeine. Today’s energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots,” he said. “Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation,” he said.” Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, “especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent,” he added. “We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxOMDE5bjU5MUVZZHluenFJa08xaVlhYk1DVjlDZkVwT0hQLXRQeTVGSVdZek00ZVRlS2Y4NXZaV0V2RWRCb3BDMFVUMzR4TnJLb0Noa0pNX2pROHJsOGpLTE50NllKcTdQLUN3czktaWFyYVZZSWFsRGh3bnZWNDJlY1Z1aW82SnVUc3h5eElvZzVJeDdjTjRCbzdIRmVuTDRPWXdWNWoyT0FUVi1XMkxrWXZhUEhtTGMwOGFsY1N3bUVMOTFLeFcyZQ</guid></item><item><title>秃鹫尸体在俄亥俄州学校外腐烂后怀疑是禽流感-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/dead-vultures-bird-flu-ohio.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 23:55:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBZSDNCTGRCUUR5b0hpZHdjY3dCMXE1OWNpbkFfX0lfTW1tdG1MRVh4Y05qMEZrYkREb2hiV0FSNDNnZDhNSlphaHZNNFpVRllaWk1felpwbjRzUERuTk1DM1oxTjZQUXpMLW1KWlhLSE1TVVZrTm13czVB</guid></item><item><title>医生在FIT 50岁后发出与能量饮料有关的中风警告- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/doctors-issue-warning-after-fit-50-year-old-gets-stroke-tied-to-energy-drinks-2000697325</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you’re a huge fan of energy drinks, you might want to listen up: a case study out today shows the perils of drinking too many of these caffeine-rich beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man in the UK developed a stroke likely caused by his habit of eight energy drinks per day, according to his doctors. Though the man ultimately recovered from the injury, he continues to have some lingering symptoms years later. The doctors say his case should offer an important lesson that these drinks aren’t necessarily harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks are not currently widely seen as dangerous for cardiovascular risks—they have been discussed because of their effect on sleep and concentration, but the public has little awareness of the more hidden risks they pose,” study author Martha Doyle, a stroke doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No other identifiable cause&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the paper, &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Case Reports, the man visited the hospital with sudden numbness on his left side and general unsteadiness. He also had a remarkably high blood pressure reading of 254/150. For context, 120/80 is normal blood pressure, while 180/120 and above is recognized as a “hypertensive crisis.” Tests soon confirmed he had experienced a mild stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The man was hospitalized for three days. He was discharged with medications to lower his blood pressure and prevent further stroke. Over the next three months of follow-up visits, he appeared to make an excellent functional recovery, though he continued to have some numbness. More worryingly, he still had incredibly high blood pressure despite his medication, and he was even readmitted to the hospital as a result. He was then given more antihypertensives.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finally, during a more detailed examination of his lifestyle, the man disclosed to doctors that he loved energy drinks. On average, he consumed eight drinks a day, each containing 160 milligrams of caffeine per serving. That amounts to about 1.3 grams of caffeine per day—over three times the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#Footnote"&gt;maximum recommended dose&lt;/a&gt; (400 milligrams) for a typical adult.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man was fit and healthy for his age, with no major stroke risk factors like a history of smoking or current alcohol drinking. The doctors’ many tests also failed to find any clear precipitating cause for his stroke, other than his very high blood pressure. So given all that, it’s almost certain the man’s energy drink habit played at least a part in spiking his blood pressure and subsequently triggering his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We attribute this patient’s stroke to the effects of his energy drink consumption because through thorough investigations using multiple diagnostic methods we ruled out any other identifiable cause,” Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the man agreed to quit energy drinks for good. Within a week, his blood pressure started to return to normal, and it remained healthy after he was weaned off the antihypertensives (yet more evidence that the drinks were to blame). Further follow-up visits showed that he made a complete recovery with no further strokes, and eight years later, his blood pressure continues to be normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, he does still experience some residual numbness to this day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself, (I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years,” the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the report.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A needed warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctors say that there are several reasons why energy drinks can raise the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems, mostly tied to the high amounts of caffeine and sometimes sugar found in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from causing a chronic rise in blood pressure, for instance, too much caffeine might cause a sudden narrowing of blood vessels in the brain or trigger an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). Some ingredients popular in these drinks, such as taurine and ginseng, might also amplify the effects of caffeine, while others like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589113/"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt; can contain high amounts of undisclosed caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been some &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/21-year-old-man-nearly-dies-of-heart-failure-after-drin-1846699497"&gt;high-profile cases&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease tied to energy drinks. Between 2022 and 2023, for instance, at least two &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-second-death-lawsuit-1851080766"&gt;heart-related&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/business/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-death/index.html"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. were linked to Panera Bread’s highly caffeinated “Charged Lemonade” energy drinks. By mid-2024, Panera had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/panera-says-phasing-controversial-charged-lemonade-rcna151058"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the item from its menu, and earlier this summer, the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/panera-settles-remaining-lawsuits-highly-caffeinated-charged-lemonade-rcna217767"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; the remaining lawsuits over these deaths and other reported injuries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the report authors say that—much like their patient—the public still isn’t generally aware of the health risks these drinks can carry. And it’s possible that these risks could warrant increased regulation of these products or the advertising for them. Compared to something like alcohol, they note, energy drinks are frequently marketed to younger kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Whether health authorities should be actively intervening we cannot definitively conclude from our reporting of just this case,” Coyle said. “However it would be beneficial to get this out there so if any similar cases exist they can be brought to attention. And also for the public, they have the right to know the risks of what they are consuming.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Speaking as someone who loves his morning and sometimes afternoon coffee, I’ll certainly be a bit more proactive in tracking my daily caffeine consumption from now on.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; He was healthy and fit at 54, an avid runner with no vices — he didn’t smoke, drink or do drugs. So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’ve never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings"&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults&lt;/a&gt; is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi said. “He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man’s blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups,” Coyle said. “This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration also r&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=Daily%20Caffeine%20Consumption%20for%20Most,generally%20associated%20with%20negative%20effects."&gt;ecommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man’s blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-1"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” the man told his doctors. “(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combinations of ingredients ‘cause havoc’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just high levels of caffeine. Today’s energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots,” he said. “Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation,” he said.” Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, “especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent,” he added. “We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-instory-ad" data-unit="/21745780820/wisc/news/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"instory-ad-2"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="first-letter"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ave you heard of Ozempic? This “miracle” weight-loss drug is all over social media. Television and radio ads are promoting it as the easy way to lose weight without changing your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who once preached body positivity now have obvious “Ozempic face.” Sunken eyes, gaunt cheeks and aging skin are signs of damaging attempts to change their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Ozempic body’ is the new ‘heroin chic’ in the world of celebrity—and the fact that it’s trickling down to the masses should concern everyone,” the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/03/lifestyle/ozempic-body-pushes-celebs-to-shrink-its-not-shaming-to-call-it-what-it-is-shocking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote on December 3. “The thinness is alarming, and it could have catastrophic consequences for how younger generations view their bodies—and look after their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic was not created as a weight-loss drug. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a Type 2 diabetes medication for altering blood sugar levels. But one side effect is appetite suppression, which can trigger rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic’s other potential side effects include “nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach (abdominal) pain and constipation,” “low blood sugar,” “dehydration leading to kidney problems,” “severe stomach problems,” “serious allergic reactions,” “gallbladder problems,” “inflammation of your pancreas,” “changes in vision,” “possible thyroid tumors, including cancer.” That comes directly from the &lt;em&gt;Ozempic.com&lt;/em&gt; homepage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have a choice: quick weight loss with Ozempic and face a host of side effects—or eat better and exercise more. Many are choosing the former, and paying $1,000 a month to Novo Nordisk A/S for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrities, Instagram influencers and everyday Americans are celebrating their slimmed-down physiques while ignoring the dangers of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus vaccination era desensitized many Americans to perpetual cycles of booster shots. Now you can get a few more injections and experience “miracle” weight loss. What’s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of the American obesity crisis show that &lt;a href="https://www.tfah.org/report-details/state-of-obesity-report-2025/"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01548-4/fulltext"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; percent of the adult U.S. population is overweight or obese. While results vary depending on the studies’ definitions of obesity, one thing is certain: Our society has a serious problem with unhealthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump boasted during a December 2 cabinet meeting that his administration has lowered the price of Ozempic, Wegovy and other prescription “fat drugs for fat people.” He takes it for granted that making these pharmaceuticals more accessible to everyday Americans is an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a tragedy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the president’s own Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has emphasized, the horrible health crisis suffered by the current generation of Americans is a &lt;em&gt;result,&lt;/em&gt; and it has a &lt;em&gt;cause.&lt;/em&gt; That cause is our indulgent and horrible health habits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and a few others are finally bringing at least some acknowledgement of the painful truth and some sanity regarding cause and effect to the federal government. But “make America healthy again” is still just a slogan if the president, the rest of the government and, much more importantly, the people continue to &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; ill health, then mask the &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; with pharmaceutical potions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[T]hou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness ….” That’s how Deuteronomy 32:15 describes the nations of Israel, which, in our generation, includes the Americans and the British, among others. This can apply literally, but the main meaning is that we are thickened and dulled in our &lt;em&gt;thinking.&lt;/em&gt; Even when our pharmaceutical “solutions” are forced to tell us up front that we are paying $1,000 per month for another dose of what effectively might be a carcinogen, we won’t stop indulging in excessive and rich foods, leisure, relaxation, entertainment and lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want the easy road. We want the quick fix. We want the miracle drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battling obesity with drugs instead of the biblical principle of turning away from the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of obesity is thick, childish reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Liberty&lt;/em&gt; published an article last month titled “&lt;a href="https://lawliberty.org/the-great-infantilization/"&gt;The Great Infantilization&lt;/a&gt;,” arguing that our nation is led by men and women “who are chronological adults yet think and behave like toddlers: profoundly unreasonable, proudly irrational, and occasionally hysterical. … [T]here are now far too many overgrown children, both male and female, in positions of political and cultural power. This immaturity is affecting and infecting nearly all of our political and cultural institutions ….”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is right out of the pages of Bible prophecy: “And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable” (Isaiah 3:4-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God has taken away the wisdom, understanding and maturity from the adult population. Verse 12 continues, “As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, &lt;em&gt;they which lead thee cause thee to err&lt;/em&gt;, and destroy the way of thy paths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father writes in &lt;a href="/1232-no-freedom-without-law"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Freedom Without Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; “All the leaders are like little children in their reasoning. They rule like ‘babes.’ … Children are guided solely by emotions—unless they are guided by a wise adult. But here in Isaiah, &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;the children rule&lt;/span&gt;, guided mainly by their emotions. And children are naturally lawless! &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Our leaders have never grown up emotionally&lt;/span&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s worshipful fascination with Ozempic bodies and pointed ignoring of “Ozempic face” encapsulates a dangerous problem in our society. Chasing short-term benefits with no care for the future is childish reasoning with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men” (1 Corinthians 14:20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second time Paul wrote “children” in that sentence, he used a different Greek word that means “infant.” Be like an infant in malice and evil, but as the Bible margin says, you must be of a &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ripe age&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;perfect&lt;/span&gt; in understanding. The &lt;em&gt;Greek Interlinear&lt;/em&gt; translates the verse: “Brothers, be not children in the minds, but in malice be like infants, and &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;in mind, be mature.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must couple the infant-like innocence of evil with the mature understanding and wisdom of a wise adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mature mind understands that you cannot engage in the causes of bodily harm (physical sin) without the effects of bodily harm. Nor can you engage in spiritual sin without the effects of spiritual sin. But so many of us think in this immature and dangerous way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides clear guidelines for healthy thinking and healthy physical living. Herbert W. Armstrong emphasized seven important laws of radiant health: Eat healthy food, and drink pure water; cleanliness; get enough sunshine and fresh air; exercise; get enough sleep and rest; ensure proper elimination; have a positive mental attitude. These laws require &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;—replacing bad behaviors like unhealthy eating and a sedentary lifestyle with right behaviors like eating whole foods and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of Bible verses show that God is the only source of physical healing. But just like spiritual healing, physical healing requires repentance—a 180-degree change in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: There is no shortcut to health. You must work to build good habits into your routine. Good health requires building character and willpower. Knowing the laws is not enough. You must obey them, and that requires battling human nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God wants us to “prosper and be in health” (3 John 2). But drugs are not the route to vigorous, radiant health. America’s leaders should end this madness. Instead, the Trump administration has made these drugs more affordable and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ozempic cult is a symptom of our societal sickness. We are a nation of legal adults who reason like overgrown children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul describes his own path to mature reasoning in 1 Corinthians 13:11: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be fooled by the quick-fix Ozempic mentality. Instead, rely on the sure Word of God to build vibrant physical and spiritual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarantine period for measles is 21 days from the exposure, which is the maximum incubation period before the tell-tale rash appears. Measles is highly infectious, with up to 90 percent of unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable people contracting the virus upon exposure. People infected with measles are infectious from four days before the rash appears to four days after its onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is occurring in the northern region of South Carolina, with many cases identified in Spartanburg County, which contains Inman, as well as Greenville County. Both counties have low vaccination rates. For the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of Spartanburg students were vaccinated, while Greenville’s vaccination rate was 92.4 percent. Those numbers are well below the 95 percent target needed to halt community transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two counties’ low vaccination rates are coupled with high rates of religious exemptions. Spartanburg has the state’s highest rate, with 8.2 percent of students exempt from the school vaccination requirement based on religious beliefs. Neighboring Greenville has a religious vaccination exemption rate of 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 111 outbreak cases, 105 were unvaccinated, three were partially vaccinated, two had an unknown status, and one case was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a national scale, vaccination rates have declined overall amid misinformation spread by anti-vaccine activists, including current Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As such, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; are at a 33-year high, with nearly 2,000 cases this year and 46 outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated to correct the year the US eliminated measles. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s normal for parents, or anyone, to have questions about vaccinations -- but what happens if your pediatrician urges a shot that’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;under attack by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s getting more likely: The nation’s leading doctors groups are in an unprecedented standoff with federal health officials who have attacked long-used, lifesaving vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revolt by pediatricians, obstetricians, family physicians, infectious disease experts and internists came to a head when an advisory panel handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;end to routine newborn vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against hepatitis B, a virus that can cause liver failure or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vaccine saves lives, helped child infections plummet and has been given safely to tens of millions of children in the U.S. alone, say the American Academy of Pediatrics and other doctors groups that vowed Tuesday to keep recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only difference. That Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices now is examining possible changes to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;the entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, questioning certain ingredients and how many doses youngsters receive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pushing back, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued its own recommendations for youngsters. Other medical groups — plus some city and state public health departments that have banded together — also are issuing their own advice on certain vaccines, which largely mirrors pre-2025 federal guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We owe our patients a consistent message informed by evidence and lived experience, not messages biased by political imperative,” Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told reporters Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But Nahass acknowledged the inevitable consumer confusion, recounting a relative calling him last weekend for advice about hepatitis B vaccination for her new grandbaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t have a Cousin Ronnie to call. They are left alone with fear and mistrust,” he said, urging parents to talk with their doctors about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;New guidelines without new data concern doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B isn’t the only vaccine challenge. Kennedy’s health department recently changed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal agencies also moved to restrict COVID-19 vaccinations this fall, and are planning policy changes that could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-prasad-memo-fda-rfk-jr-7cf543476ab3867b25a47463c9c5c144"&gt;restrict future flu and coronavirus shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to vaccine advice, “for decades, ACIP was the gold standard,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel once routinely enlisted specialists in specific diseases for long deliberations of the latest science and safety data, resulting in recommendations typically adopted not only by the CDC but by the medical field at large, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week’s meeting of Kennedy’s panel, which includes vaccine skeptics, marked a radical departure. CDC specialists weren’t allowed to present data on hepatitis B, the childhood vaccine schedule or questions about vaccine ingredients. Few of the committee members have public health experience, and some expressed confusion about the panel’s proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At one point, a doctor called in to say the panel was misrepresenting her study’s findings. And the panel’s chairman wondered why one dose of yellow fever vaccine protected him during a trip to Africa when U.S. children get three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is designed to protect children for life from a virus they can encounter anywhere, not just on a trip abroad. And other scientists noted it was carefully studied for years to prove the three-dose course offers decades of immunity — evidence that a single dose simply doesn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they’ve got new data, I’m all for it — let’s see it and have a conversation,” said Dr. Kelly Gebo, an infectious disease specialist and public health dean at George Washington University, who watched for that. “I did not see any new data,” so she’s not changing her vaccine advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Committee members argued that most babies’ risk of hepatitis B infection is very low and that earlier research on infant shot safety was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially unusual was a presentation from a lawyer who voiced doubt about studies that proved benefits of multiple childhood vaccines and promoted discredited research pointing to harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think at any point in the committee’s history, there was a 90-minute uninterrupted presentation by someone who wasn’t a physician, a scientist, or a public health expert on the topic — let alone someone who, who makes his living in vaccine litigation,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy expert at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By abandoning data and the consensus of front-line doctors, the ACIP is “actively burning down the credibility that made its recommendations so powerful,” added Stanford’s Scott. “Most parents will still follow their pediatricians, and AAP is holding the line here. But the mixed messages are precisely what erode confidence over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Parents already have a choice — they need solid guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration health officials say it’s important to restore choice to parents and to avoid mandates. That’s how the panel’s hepatitis B recommendation was framed — that parents who really want it could get their children vaccinated later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents already have a choice, said Dr. Aaron Milstone of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The government makes population-wide recommendations while families and their doctors tailor choices to each person’s health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many doctors don’t — or can’t — do their own lengthy scientific review of vaccines and thus had relied on the ACIP and CDC information, Yale’s Schwartz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They “rely on trusted expert voices to help navigate what is, even in the best of times, a complicated landscape regarding the evidence for vaccines and how best to use them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a role that the pediatricians and other doctors groups, plus those multistate collaborations, aim to fill with their own guidelines — while acknowledging it will be a huge task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, “ask your questions, bring your concerns and let us talk about them,” said Dr. Sarah Nosal, of the American Academy of Family Physicians, urging anyone with vaccine questions to have an open conversation with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Early reports show a fast-moving wave of infections that is already sending vulnerable individuals to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, infection levels remain low in most regions, yet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wastewater Surveillance System data shows flu activity rising in more than three dozen states as of early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC is warning that this flu season could be as bad as last year's flu season, which was the worst on record on hospitalizations and severe disease,” said Shereef Elnahal, president of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, during a recent press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dawn Nolt, an infectious disease expert at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University raised concerns of how the strain this flu season could have on the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't have that many beds,” Nolt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“So one bed that's needed to treat a child with a respiratory illness is one less bed for the child who has to recover from surgery from appendicitis, who needs treatment for a bleeding disorder, or for the child who decides to take up skateboarding in the middle of winter and has a fracture."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon officials are watching the situation closely. Howard Chiou, medical director at the Oregon Health Authority, emphasized that while hospitalization and test positivity rates are currently typical for this point in the season, both indicators are trending upward. Given influenza’s rapid mutation rate, Chiou urged residents to get vaccinated rather than wait for clearer signs of severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t wait for an accident to put the seat belt on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine uptake, however, remains a concern. Roughly 1 million Oregonians—about 23% of the state—have received a flu shot so far, a figure approximately five percentage points lower than last year. Officials attribute the decline partly to the broader rise in vaccine skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising case numbers in several states hint at the strain’s disruptive potential. Massachusetts has observed a sharp acceleration in activity, with flu-related hospitalizations more than doubling in just two weeks. In Iowa, an “extremely high” rate of illness forced the Moulton-Udell school district to close for two days and cancel athletic events after nearly 30% of students and staff became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the CDC estimates that between 1.9 million and 3.3 million Americans have contracted the flu since October, with as many as 38,000 requiring hospitalization. Some hospital systems—including those in New Jersey and California’s Sonoma County—have reinstated mask requirements to protect high-risk patients during the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts note that although this year’s influenza season appears to be starting earlier, an early onset does not necessarily predict a more severe peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 22:22:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNd1Mxdk5PTTIySld0ZW04UGlZSkhfMUVSSlJMaWl0Q0pkb2p5VHkyOEdCS2hWS3NIVW5aMXVUY3B6Tk4tMnMzbFU4V19PSnF0NUN1b1R2cEx2UjJUeUpSMzJWeVJ5VVB4YjdwMEVuQlBjRWUwTndiWEF1Z05jNlA5anVLWG1LZElnR2FNS1k5Vnp4TmNwMUZsOVpVaEp0VHFTd0FVVFNrY21EQkQtM2F5dWVDbUVSV1N1ZjBvZlBUOUNxZ1dKOXNjQ29IcWNOeUVvRXlPY2lxQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养专家的说法，你永远不应该空腹喝的6种饮料-非常简单</title><link>https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-not-to-have-on-empty-stomach-11865387</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-article-intro_1-0" class="comp mntl-article-intro mntl-block article-content__description"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re between meals or just waking up, consuming certain beverages can irritate your stomach if you haven't eaten in a while. Below, we asked experts which &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-that-are-not-as-healthy-as-they-seem-11746821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinks you should avoid&lt;/a&gt; on an empty stomach, plus what to do when you’re craving that first sip of coffee or soda but need to eat something first.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people swear by &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-study-says-coffee-can-help-you-live-longer-11748513" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt; to boost their mood and concentration. In addition, this breakfast staple can protect against &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455881/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;diabetes and certain types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But when you haven’t eaten in a while, drinking coffee, especially black coffee, can be tough on your stomach. “Since coffee contains chlorogenic acids, it’s highly acidic and stimulates the stomach to produce even more acid,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sacredheart.edu/phonebook/jacqueline-vernarelli.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Jacqueline A. Vernarelli&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, nutritional epidemiologist, public health nutritionist, and associate professor at Sacred Heart University. “Coffee can increase gastric motility (speed of digestion), which can irritate the stomach lining.” Moreover, having coffee on an empty stomach can lead to acid reflux, heartburn, anxiety, jitters, shakiness, and a faster heart rate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, drinking coffee can help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;jumpstart their bowel movements&lt;/a&gt;, while it can have the opposite effect on others, especially if they regularly consume &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40600201/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high amounts of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. “If you’re prone to acid reflux, you definitely don’t want to be drinking coffee on an empty stomach,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Amanda Sauceda&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian and gut health nutritionist.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that you don’t have to give up your morning brew. Vernarelli suggests adding a splash of milk or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/are-plant-based-milks-better-for-you-8628856" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; to lower the acidity of coffee and slow caffeine absorption. “The best alternative is to drink water, or eat a small snack like a banana, yogurt, or a slice of toast before your coffee,” she says. If you wake up not feeling hungry, Sauceda recommends starting with half a cup of coffee or switching to decaf to see if it makes a difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@3934bc40" data-item-index="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sorry to pile on if you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/is-it-better-to-start-your-day-with-coffee-or-tea-11759735" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine-lover&lt;/a&gt;, but swapping coffee for tea won’t soothe an empty stomach. “The caffeine in tea can increase gastric acid production,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/kristen-carli?utm_source=direct" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen Carli&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, dietitian from WOWMD. When this happens, you might notice symptoms like nausea, acid reflux, and stomach cramping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with coffee, another concern is the temperature of your tea. Drinking tea that is too hot can irritate the lining of your esophagus and stomach. Besides allowing your beverage to cool, Carli recommends avoiding strong teas that are made by &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-steep-tea-7153209" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;steeping the tea&lt;/a&gt; longer or using tea bags with crushed leaves to release the flavor more quickly. Before having tea, try eating a high-fat or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-snacks-8584150" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein snack&lt;/a&gt;, like a hard-boiled egg, yogurt, oatmeal, or whole-grain bread. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The distinctive pop and fizz you hear when opening a can of soda is like premium ASMR. But what it does for your ears doesn’t translate to your stomach, unfortunately. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-sodas-at-the-supermarket-11719818" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbonated drinks&lt;/a&gt; like cola and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/beverages/sparkling-water" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; get their fizziness from carbon dioxide, which expands into gas when it reaches your stomach, Carli says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This gas continues to build and rise unless there’s food in the stomach to prevent it,” she explains. “When the gas rises, it brings with it stomach acid that can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554462/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contribute to reflux&lt;/a&gt;.” Reflux occurs when stomach acid flows backward into your esophagus, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/how-many-times-should-you-chew-your-food" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, which is a burning sensation in your chest. Along with reflux, you may experience symptoms like bloating and burping. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To prevent reflux, it’s best to limit or skip carbonated drinks. “Avoid drinking carbonated drinks until after you’ve eaten,” Carli says. But if you decide to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-ruining-your-teeth-11795347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drink something fizzy&lt;/a&gt; before eating, sip it slowly and stay upright for at least 30 minutes to help with digestion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@2c1032bc" data-item-index="3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-citrus-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Citrus Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These juices are made from citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit. Despite being a delicious &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/orange-juice-benefits-8684680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, citrus juice is high in citric acid and sugar. “The acidity of orange juice can irritate the stomach lining, which can be an issue if you have ulcers,” Sauceda says. She adds that drinking orange juice can trigger or worsen symptoms of acid reflux. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from being acidic, citrus juice contains a lot of sugar. “The &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/low-sugar-fruits-7481285" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar found in fruit&lt;/a&gt; isn’t inherently bad for you, but it can spike your blood sugar, leading to cravings or energy crashes.” Moreover, when you haven’t eaten anything, drinking citrus juice can lead to cramping, nausea, and the post-spike &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-make-you-tired-8738277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sugar crash&lt;/a&gt;, Vernarelli says. This crash refers to a sudden drop in blood sugar that can make you feel dizzy, tired, or irritable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy a glass of juice in the morning, make sure to eat something with it. Vernarelli recommends having a few bites of protein or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, such as nuts, yogurt, or eggs, before drinking juice to help stabilize your blood sugar. “Personally, I find that something starchy can help settle my stomach when I have orange juice,” Sauceda says. She’s also a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/surprising-ingredient-that-makes-smoothies-creamier-11726758" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;making a smoothie&lt;/a&gt; to help your gut tolerate juice better.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/how-to-boost-energy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fighting the urge to yawn&lt;/a&gt;, you might be tempted to reach for an energy drink. “These drinks often have extremely high caffeine levels and are full of sugar, which can spike blood glucose levels,” Vernarelli says. Even sugar-free options often contain high amounts of caffeine. Whether your drink comes in a 16-oz. can or a 2-oz. energy shot, your body tends to absorb these beverages more quickly without food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, “energy drinks commonly contain additives like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/taurine-benefits-8690088" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt;, guarana, and niacin, which can cause nausea when taken without food,” Vernarelli says. Her advice is to consume these drinks with a protein-rich snack, such as nuts, cheese, yogurt, or eggs. These foods can help slow caffeine absorption and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-upset-stomach-8720850" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce gastrointestinal distress&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/favorite-brunch-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having brunch&lt;/a&gt; mimosas (minus brunch) or evening cocktails, alcohol is bad news if it’s been hours since your last meal. “Alcohol is absorbed very quickly through the stomach lining,” Carli says. “Without food in the stomach to slow that process, the levels of alcohol in your blood can rise quickly.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The result can be rapid intoxication and a burning sensation in your stomach. She explains that alcohol can irritate the stomach lining because it increases gastric acid secretion. Similar to juice, alcohol can also interfere with your body’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-alcohol-to-drink-8391763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regulate glucose&lt;/a&gt;, leading to low blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid these unpleasant effects, Carli recommends eating a balanced meal first. This means filling your plate with vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. She also suggests choosing drinks with a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/entertaining/food-drink/alcohol-content-wine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower alcohol content&lt;/a&gt; and drinking water between alcoholic beverages to reduce stomach irritation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that pomegranate juice can decrease both systolic and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure, but the benefits appear to last only up to two months of daily intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pomegranate juice and beet juice are beverages that supply nutrients and plant compounds that can improve heart health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich in polyphenol antioxidants:&lt;/strong&gt; Pomegranate juice is high in polyphenols, like anthocyanins and ellagitannins, which have powerful antioxidant and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-7497504" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; activity, making it a good choice for &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/heart-health-quiz-8728778" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supports blood vessel health:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that pomegranate juice may help improve arterial elasticity and protect against atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good source of potassium: &lt;/strong&gt;A cup of pomegranate juice contains 533 milligrams, or 11% of your daily potassium needs, a mineral that plays an important role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/heart-disease/high-blood-pressure-symptoms" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;blood pressure regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High in dietary nitrates:&lt;/strong&gt; Beet juice’s nitrate content helps relax blood vessels and improve circulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good source of antioxidants: &lt;/strong&gt;Beets provide a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/what-are-antioxidants" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, including betalains, which have been shown to have potent cellular-protective and anti-inflammatory activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good source of folate: &lt;/strong&gt;A cup of beet juice packs 16% of your daily needs for folate, a B vitamin that's needed for red blood cell formation, DNA and RNA synthesis, fetal growth and development, and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pomegranate juice is a more concentrated source of calories and carbs than beet juice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beet juice is lower in carbs than pomegranate juice, with a cup of beet juice containing less than half of the amount of carbs.

			&lt;p&gt;Gout is often blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;overindulgence in alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or unhealthy eating, but research suggests genetics plays a much bigger role in the painful arthritic condition than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, an international team of scientists looked at genetic data collected from 2.6 million people across 13 different cohorts of DNA data. That number included 120,295 people with "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;prevalent gout&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genetic codes of people with the condition to those of people without, the team found 377 specific &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"&gt;DNA regions&lt;/a&gt; where there were variations linked to gout – 149 of which hadn't been associated with the disease before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revive-20-million-year-old-gene-to-help-fight-gout"&gt;Scientists Revive 20-Million-Year-Old Gene to Help Fight Gout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and environmental factors are certainly still in play, the findings suggest genetics is a major driver of gout risk – and the researchers think there may be more undiscovered genetic links still to be found, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer – the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Tony Merriman from the University of Otago in New Zealand, when the study was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout takes hold&lt;/a&gt; when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood, which then form sharp crystal needles in the joints. When the body's immune system starts to attack those crystals, it leads to significant pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics is important in every stage of that process, the researchers suggest. Particularly, it affects the likelihood of the body's immune system attacking the crystals, and in the way &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"&gt;uric acid&lt;/a&gt; is transported around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gout can come and go, but there are treatments available – and the authors behind the study think misconceptions can put people off getting those treatments. That's a real problem with cases of the condition &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrrheum.2015.91"&gt;rising and rising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of giving us a better understanding of the causes of gout, the study provides scientists with more options to explore when it comes to treatments, particularly in terms of managing the body's immune response to the buildup of uric acid.

      &lt;p&gt;If you've noticed that one drink hits you harder than it used to, you're not alone. It's part of the natural aging process, and it may be your body doing you a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the holidays, and for many people that means more parties and more occasions for alcoholic drinks. NPR's Maria Godoy reports on how alcohol can hit harder as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Once upon a time, a drink or two went down the hatch with no problems. Now it's a recipe for misery. Sound familiar? Dr. Monica Christmas of the University of Chicago Medicine says it's a common lament as people enter middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONICA CHRISTMAS: You are not alone. I am in that age range, too, and absolutely it needs to be spread out or it's all going to go straight to my head and I will need to sleep half the day away the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: There are physiological explanations for why our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age. For one thing, the liver enzymes that break down alcohol become less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: And so that means that our bodies metabolize alcohol a little bit differently. And we also lose more muscle as we get older, and that muscle is replaced by fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: That's important because muscle stores water, which dilutes alcohol in our blood. Having less muscle mass means alcohol will hang around in our bodies longer, says Johannes Thrul. He's an alcohol and substance abuse researcher at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHANNES THRUL: And so what this means is that the same drink that previously maybe felt just fine now leads to a higher blood alcohol level. You feel the effects for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: These changes happen to both men and women as they enter middle age. But for women in perimenopause, Christmas says alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms that come with hormonal fluctuations, like mood swings and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: Alcohol is - already is known to be a depressant. It can also increase baseline anxiety symptoms. Alcohol can disrupt sleep too. If you're already experiencing all of those symptoms, it's just that much more compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: While worse hangovers might not sound like a good thing, think of it as your body nudging you in the right direction. Geriatrician Ken Koncilja with the Cleveland Clinic says the risks of drinking alcohol increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEN KONCILJA: Things like liver disease, increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure very much can be exacerbated. Memory problems - alcohol use can cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: It can also interfere with many medications and lead to balance problems and more falls. And drinking alcohol raises the risk of several types of cancer. Koncilja says he makes it a point to discuss the benefits of cutting back with his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KONCILJA: And these conversations about alcohol use, being proactive with people in their 50s and 60s has huge impact for their health and well-being when they're in their 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Johannes Thrul of Johns Hopkins says while the healthiest option is to not drink at all, even small changes to cut back can reap health benefits. During holiday parties, he says, try alternating alcoholic drinks with mocktails, and drink plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THRUL: Why don't you just give it a try and see how it feels? 'Cause you might be surprised how good it actually is when you sleep better, you have less anxiety the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: He says your body will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Godoy, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nearly 800 New Yorkers were hospitalized with the flu that week, up 93% from the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1isr3"&gt;State officials are urging New Yorkers to get vaccinated against the flu, as well as against COVID and RSV, as they prepare to gather with friends and family for the winter holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3qoq5"&gt;"We expect a more severe flu season due to circulating strains of the virus compared to last year,” state Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c299l"&gt;"Gathering with loved ones is what this season is all about,” McDonald continued. “Vaccines ensure we have the best protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fjk8q"&gt;About 3.4 million New Yorkers had gotten their flu shots for the season as of mid-November, a slight drop from the same period last year, when 3.5 million flu shots had been given out statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="48l34"&gt;State data shows COVID vaccination has also dropped 30% so far this season compared with the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evjph"&gt;A period of confusion over access to the shots ensued this fall amid a shift in federal guidance. Gov. Kathy Hochul has since issued and repeatedly extended an &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/hochul-extends-covid-19-vaccine-order-as-federal-access-stalls-under-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; allowing pharmacies to administer the shots to all children older than 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2u5n7"&gt;A new regional public health collaborative that includes New York has also issued its own &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/northeast-public-health-collaborative-recommendations-for-the-2025-2026-covid-19-vaccine/download" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends the shots for those six months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c22n7"&gt;There were 1,948 confirmed cases of COVID in New York the last week of November, a slight dip from the week before. RSV, meanwhile, is on the rise. There were 2,200 cases reported statewide the last week of November, up 17% from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dc9le"&gt;According to the state, there have been 13 respiratory disease outbreaks in hospitals so far this season and 15 in nursing homes.

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Avoid 'brain' supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From fish oils to vitamins and softgels claiming to boost memory, every pharmacy seems to be selling the next miracle pill to boost your brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Landsverk cast doubt on these claims, saying that, realistically, no pill could replace someone doing the basics of eating well and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Daily Mail: 'To prevent dementia, you do need to look at changing your habits, as opposed to taking a pill and still having your steak and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On the list was brain supplements, which they said were not likely to boost cognitive health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'None of these supplements have been proven to be helpful. None of them have proven efficacy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are sold as supplements, they do not go through safety or efficacy testing and do not need to be proven effective in studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Landsverk also raised concerns over potential contaminants in neurological-related supplements that could harm someone's brain rather than boost its health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/3822"&gt;2020 study by the American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; that tested 10 supplements bearing names such as 'nootropics', 'smart drugs' and 'cognitive enhancers' detected prescription drugs in them that were not approved for use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs included two analogs of piracetam, a prescription drug used to improve brain function approved in Europe that has not been approved in the US because of little evidence it is effective, and phenibut, a nervous system depressant that has been linked to addiction, reduced consciousness and breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Failing to wear glasses or use hearing aides when needed was also a factor, the researchers said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't go without your glasses or hearing aids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 75 percent of Americans need some form of vision correction, while around 15 percent, mostly older adults, need a hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surveys suggest that many who need these inventions avoid them, either because of concerns over their appearance, habit or a refusal to admit either has deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa warned, however, that not using these could raise the risk of someone suffering from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence around making sure things like hearing troubles or vision problems are addressed to help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are two main theories why these may be a risk; One is that, as people have more trouble with hearing and vision, they kind of stop interacting with the world a bit more and, by doing that, they are more socially isolated, and we know that social isolation is a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The other potential pathway would be the idea that, because the brain is receiving less input due to a vision or hearing impediment, the brain is stimulated less and this somehow injures or harms the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that less stimulation of the brain may weaken connections between neurons in the organ, raising the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2813302#:~:text=Results%20The%20study%20population%20comprised,more%20high%2Dquality%20longitudinal%20studies."&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 573,000 people, including 40,000 with hearing loss, found that those who had hearing loss but were not using hearing aids had a 20 percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who had hearing loss but were using the devices, they had a six percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There was also a warning over living in cities, with experts saying the pollution, noise and lack of green spaces could affect someone's health (Above is Bangkok, Thailand)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Choose your home wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many are attracted to the big city for job opportunities, higher salaries and the chance to mingle with a wide variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa warned that these 'concrete jungles', where about 80 percent of the US population live, could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Landsverk, shown above, also warned over the risk factors that could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence that pollution exposure in life may increase the risk for cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the amount of traffic, noise, your ability to get outside into say, parks or green space where you are able to do physical activity and interact with friends, all of those seem to have an important impact on your risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have previously suggested that pollution may raise the risk of dementia because it leads people to breathe in more fine particles that can enter the circulatory system and be carried to the brain, where they damage brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being in a neighborhood with few green spaces or meeting points may also pose a risk, researchers suggest, because someone may have fewer opportunities to socialize with friends or a community or stimulate their brain through vigorous physical activity, which can also raise their risk of suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts also recommended that people should get the shingles vaccine, which studies have suggested may be able to reduce someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't skip the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shingles vaccine is recommended for all adults aged 50 years or older, but estimates suggest less than 40 percent get the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Ken Langa, an internist and dementia researcher at the University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine protects against the chickenpox virus, which remains dormant in the body for decades after an infection and can be reactivated, often in later life when the immune system is weaker. About 1 million Americans get shingles every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa told Daily Mail that the vaccine could also have a second, unexpected, use; preventing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The shingles vaccine prevents or decreases the risk that the [chickenpox] virus gets reactivated and, therefore, decreases the amount of inflammation that your body is exposed to and has to fight off the virus again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Certainly, one theory is that because the vaccine will decrease the likelihood of having a shingles episode, it decreases the likelihood of the body having high inflammation, and the nerves in the brain sort of benefit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;study published in July&lt;/a&gt; last year found that, out of 100,000 adults tracked, those who received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over the next seven years than those who did not receive the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of a tick biting a human. In some cases, Lyme disease may also raise someone's risk of being diagnosed with dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Watch out for tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 10 Americans are bitten by a tick every year, and nearly half a million people are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is treated with antibiotics, but can cause brain fog, headaches, memory issues and drooping on one side of the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, amid anecdotal cases, experts are looking into whether the tick-borne disease may also be a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jessica Zwerling, a neurologist at the Montefiore Hudson Balley Center of Excellence for Alzheimer's Disease in New York City, said: 'Lyme disease can raise the risk of arthritis, and a different type of brain disease when it comes to dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa said: 'It would not be top of my list, maybe five or six paragraphs down, but there is evidence to suggest that this could raise the risk of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said that Lyme disease may raise the risk of dementia by causing inflammation in the body, which could disrupt nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society says online that there is now increasing evidence to suggest a potential link between dementia and Lyme disease, but that it is not yet enough to say that it can cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'In rare cases Lyme disease can also affect the brain, causing dementia-like symptoms. With early treatment, this is reversible.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Society cited a 2023 case study of a man who developed a form of dementia years after suffering from Lyme disease, although said it was not clear whether the two were connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:56:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNdXk2OHJzTkluMXRoUjJrWGpDd3FyLW5fOHpObW0xbE9iRzV6dHlmS0xqYWkyaDkyZTNsVmhqNXBYbXJKVUxlOUxIeU5uNnM0dklFdzRKb0VDcm9KUm5XT3dERUxPRU5aa3puQzktQ1FwZndmbm9QZnJPa19oSktSWG1zZ1U1WGZuTzU4amlB0gGTAUFVX3lxTFBNMURZUjdsRnUxamNzVTU0RHZFRnRzTjlKQ0wwZ0Z2QkVqck1nU21RR2ttelpnZFFaQzloMzNpNVFIaEhaNHVRNk1VYzI2emhuM0JqeG1OY3FrQjlvYVhURmRUMTZEMFJyb3h6OFlBbC11MU5HY1F0aDc4MmNueXNDLUVsRE80Y000LUlOUXRYY2pTdw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州健康警报| TPWD警告对包括猫在内的动物的高度传染性威胁- KHOU</title><link>https://www.khou.com/article/news/health/bird-flu-avian-influenza-spreads-birds-galveston-texas-us/285-286d6723-1641-4032-b844-07b58035039c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Potentially deadly avian flu, or H5 bird flu, has been found in wild birds in all 50 states. Other animals, including cats and cows, are highly susceptible to it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Days after we learned that HPAI &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GCHDInfo/posts/pfbid06co2WWxfAvvwnZH2hC5jkcmZ2WFBHrmvCAWFMiS82FpJE1cMqW8if34qGudZNLvtl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;avian influenza, or bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, had been &lt;a href="/article/news/local/bird-flu-cats-galveston-county-health-department-warning/285-e21bafe9-b21b-4180-9a0b-212232427fa9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;detected in Galveston County&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) issued its own alert. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious bird flu, which transmits easily among wild and domestic birds, has now been detected in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, according to TPWD.  While avian influenza is endemic, meaning it occurs regularly, wildlife officials say they've seen cases earlier this year, so they want you to be on alert. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of birds in Texas and nationwide&lt;a href="/article/money/consumer/nightmare-scenario-poultry-farmers-record-high-egg-demand-amid-threat-bird-flu/285-96bd52c9-5f25-46c9-9f5c-239639cb4fd6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt; died from bird flu earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, causing egg prices to soar. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While human cases are rare, bird flu can spread directly between animals and indirectly through environmental contamination. Some animals -- including domestic cats, dairy cows, skunks, foxes, raccoons, bobcats and mountain lions -- are highly susceptible. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The public can assist in interrupting HPAI transmission by limiting all unnecessary contact with wild birds and discouraging the congregation of waterfowl around food, water sources and backyard flocks,” a representative with Texas Parks and Wildlife told KHOU 11.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing the spread of bird flu&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPWD offered tips to help stop the spread of bird flu in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit unnecessary contact with wild birds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bird feeders and water sources should be cleaned at least every two weeks with a solution of one part household bleach to nine parts water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change water in birdbaths every few days and regularly remove wet feed and seed from feed and water sources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discourage the congregation of waterfowl around food, water sources and backyard flocks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional precautions for game bird hunters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dispose of carcasses properly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear gloves when processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid eating or processing any sick birds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect tools between carcasses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook meat to the proper temperature&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Bird flu in Galveston County&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 2, the Galveston County Health District said &lt;a href="/article/news/local/bird-flu-cats-galveston-county-health-department-warning/285-e21bafe9-b21b-4180-9a0b-212232427fa9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;27 birds had been reported dead. &lt;/a&gt;The six that were sent to UTMB tested presumptively positive for the highly contagious infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No human cases have been reported there. Eight people who had direct contact with the infected birds and who were showing possible symptoms tested negative for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Out of an abundance of caution, all eight individuals are currently taking Tamiflu," the health district said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the risk to the public remains low, but they're urging everyone to avoid contact with birds.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you find a dead bird, do not touch it," GCHD advised.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners are also advised to keep a close eye on their pets. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Outdoor cats that hunt or scavenge for birds may be at higher risk of exposure," the district warns. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners should watch for these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden or unusual lethargy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eye or nasal discharge &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurologic symptoms, such as stumbling, tremors or disorientation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your pet has any of these symptoms, take them to your veterinarian as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indoor cats are considered low risk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCHD said it's working closely with UTMB, the Texas Department of State Health Services and Texas Parks and Wildlife to monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
