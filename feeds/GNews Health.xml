			&lt;p&gt;A UK man who is thought to be Britain's youngest dementia sufferer recently passed away from the disease at only 24 years old. Andre Yarham, from Norfolk in England, was just 22 when he was first diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 24, most brains are still settling into adulthood. But Yarham's brain looked decades older – resembling the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37828227/uks-youngest-dementia-patient-dies-brain-70-year-old/"&gt;brain of a 70-year-old&lt;/a&gt;, according to the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="188399" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan that helped diagnose him with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yarham initially &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/youngest-dementia-andre-yarham-death-b2896596.html"&gt;began exhibiting symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of dementia in 2022, with family saying he had become increasingly forgetful and would sometimes have a blank expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sad-case-of-the-youngest-person-ever-to-be-diagnosed-with-alzheimers"&gt;The Sad Case of The Youngest Person Ever to Be Diagnosed With Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final stages of his life, he lost his speech, could no longer care for himself, behaved "inappropriately," and was bound to his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is usually associated with old age. However, some forms of dementia can strike astonishingly early and move frighteningly fast. Take &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241411732"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. This was the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/youngest-dementia-patient-andre-yarham-norfolk-b2896579.html"&gt;form of dementia&lt;/a&gt; that Yarham was diagnosed with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188399" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, which tends to affect memory first, frontotemporal dementia attacks the parts of the brain involved in personality, behaviour, and language. These regions sit behind the forehead and above the ears in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/095943889390204C?via%3Dihub"&gt;frontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3420617/"&gt;temporal&lt;/a&gt; lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188405" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-642x433.jpg" alt="Human brain anatomy, illustration" class="size-medium wp-image-188405" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-642x433.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188405" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of the human brain anatomy. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas help us plan, control impulses, understand speech, and express ourselves. When they're damaged, people may change in ways that are deeply distressing for families – becoming withdrawn, impulsive, or unable to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia is a less common form of dementia, thought to account for around &lt;a href="https://www.dementiauk.org/wp-content/uploads/dementia-uk-understanding-frontemporal-dementia.pdf"&gt;one in 20&lt;/a&gt; cases. What makes it especially cruel is that it can appear in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, frontotemporal dementia has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988710383574"&gt;strong genetic component&lt;/a&gt;. Changes in specific genes can disrupt how brain cells handle proteins. Instead of these proteins being broken down and recycled, they clump together inside the neurons (brain cells) – interfering with their ability to function and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, affected brain cells stop working and die. As more cells are lost, the brain tissue itself shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this process can sometimes begin so early in life is still not fully understood. However, when a person has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.004"&gt;powerful genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt;, the disease does not need decades to unfold. Instead, the mutation allows the damage to accelerate, and the brain's usual resilience fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans carried out while Yarham was alive showed striking shrinkage for someone so young. But to compare Yarham's brain with that of someone in their 70s would be misleading. His brain had not "aged faster" in the usual sense. Instead, large numbers of neurons had been lost in a short period of time because of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00412"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, the brain changes slowly. Certain regions become a little thinner, but the overall structure remains intact for decades. But in aggressive forms of dementia, whole brain networks collapse at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes can shrink dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these regions deteriorate, people lose the abilities that those areas support – including speech, emotional control, and decision-making abilities. This would explain why Yarham lost language so late but so suddenly – and why his need for full-time care escalated so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain donation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yarham's family decided to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k9xp5je1go.amp"&gt;donate his brain to research&lt;/a&gt;. This is an extraordinary gift – one that transforms tragedy into hope for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia currently has no cure. Once symptoms begin, there's no way to stop them, and treatments that slow symptoms have limited effects. Part of the reason for this is because the brain is vastly complex and still not entirely understood. Every donated brain helps close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains affected by very early dementia are exceptionally rare. Each donated brain allows scientists to study, in fine detail, what went wrong at the level of cells and proteins. Although brain scans can tell us what brain parts have been lost, only donated tissue can reveal why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can examine which proteins accumulated, which cell types were most vulnerable, and how inflammation and immune responses may have contributed to the damage. That knowledge feeds directly into efforts to develop treatments that slow, stop, or even prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family's decision to allow scientists to study tissue from such a rare, early-onset case of frontotemporal dementia could help unlock secrets that may guide treatments for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscientist, I have been asked how something like this can happen to someone so young. The honest answer is that we are only beginning to understand the biology that makes some brains vulnerable from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases like this underline why sustained investment in brain research, and the generosity of people willing to donate tissue, matters so deeply. The 24-year-old's story is a reminder that dementia is not a single disease, and not a problem confined to old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding why it happened will be one small step toward making sure it does not happen again.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272972/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                                    
                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles was reported in a person who traveled last week through Maryland while infectious, state health officials announced Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said the person traveled on trains from Jan. 7-8, &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland%20Dept%20of%20Health%20issues%20notification%20of%20potential%20measles%20exposures%20associated%20with%20person%20who%20traveled%20through%20Maryland.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the agency said anyone who may have been near the following public areas may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional train from Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station to D.C.’s Union Station from 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Jan. 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak’s BWI Marshall Airport shuttle bus to and from the BWI Marshall train station and the drop-off points outside of the lower level of the airport from 10:45 p.m. on Jan. 7 to 1:30 a.m. on Jan. 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BWI Marshall Airport parking shuttle bus to and from the lower levels outside of the BWI Marshall Airport and the airport’s long-term parking lots from 11 p.m. on Jan. 7 to 2 a.m. on Jan. 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials said people who were not in these locations at the times specified were not exposed to the infectious person while they were in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDH also said there were no exposures identified inside the terminals of the BWI Marshall Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency said additional exposures sites occurred in other states, and that information related to those exposures will be provided by those states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/news-releases/virginia-health-officials-investigating-a-confirmed-measles-case-in-northern-region/?utm_campaign=20260111_&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;separate statement&lt;/a&gt;, the Virginia Department of Health also flagged the Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center Emergency Department and Executive Medicine Suite in Fort Belvoir as a potential exposure site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials said anyone who traveled to the site Friday, from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 10 p.m. to midnight, may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VDH described the patient as a “preschool-age child” who had “recently traveled internationally.” The department said the incident marks the state’s second measles of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you’ve been exposed, MDH suggests finding out if you’ve been vaccinated for measles or have had it before. If you’ve gotten two doses of a measles vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are generally considered protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure if you’ve been immunized, check your status by calling your health care provider or &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/OIDEOR/IMMUN/Pages/immunet-for-public.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;requesting records&lt;/a&gt; through the My Immunization Record online portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’re not fully vaccinated or otherwise immune to measles and you might have been exposed, contact your health care provider or your &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/pages/departments.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the best next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDH said exposed individuals need to monitor for any early signs of measles for 21 days after the initial potential exposure. Symptoms can range from runny nose, cough, red and watery eyes, and a fever exceeding 101 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, the health agency stresses individuals must stay home, and to avoid public spaces. Individuals should contact a health care facility before arriving to any care centers.&lt;/p&gt;


                
                
                &lt;p class="After-content"&gt;
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;

Her research focuses on parasite infections and on community monitoring in El Paso, blending lab studies with fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their surveillance focused on places where people and wildlife overlap, because that boundary creates chances for bugs to find new hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kissing-bugs-parasites-and-chagas-disease"&gt;Kissing bugs, parasites, and Chagas disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-%28american-trypanosomiasis%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chagas disease&lt;/a&gt;, a parasitic infection that can damage heart and gut, affects more than seven million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite slips into muscle cells, which lets it hide for years and slowly scar the heart or digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long symptom-free stretches make routine detection hard, so many people learn about infection only after serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs act as a vector, an insect that carries a parasite between hosts, when they feed on blood at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bite, the insect can leave infected feces nearby, and the parasite enters through rubbed skin, eyes, or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That messy route means simple contact matters, especially when bugs wander indoors or rest under porches and wood piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 10 months, from April 2024 to March 2025, UTEP field teams checked traps across desert sites and neighborhood edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set light traps about 3.3 feet above ground, then picked up adult bugs that flew in overnight. Because the team caught only adults, the data cannot yet show where the insects breed around homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tests-that-spot-the-parasite"&gt;Tests that spot the parasite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the lab, researchers used polymerase chain reaction (&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-virus-can-remain-in-sperm-months-after-infection/"&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt;), a DNA test that detects tiny genetic traces, to screen each insect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They removed gut tissue, broke cells open in the buffer, and searched for &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt; DNA with special probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive signal shows the parasite passed through that bug, but it does not prove the insect infected anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microscope checks identified every specimen as &lt;em&gt;Triatoma rubida&lt;/em&gt;, the species that turned up across the El Paso and Las Cruces sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors found adults in Franklin Mountains State Park and in residential areas, often tucked beneath shaded debris and outdoor structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mix of wild and built settings increases chances that people and pets encounter infected insects during everyday routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infection-turns-chronic"&gt;Infection turns chronic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 survey, Maldonado’s group found &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; in 63.3 percent of collected bugs, far lower than today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; infections appear to be increasing,” said Maldonado. The new count comes from a small sample, so wider trapping will show whether the rise holds across seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people never notice the early illness, then enter the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cell-therapy-improves-brain-activity-after-stroke/"&gt;chronic phase&lt;/a&gt;, the long stage after early infection, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, parasites hide in heart and digestive muscles, which can trigger rhythm problems, heart failure, or enlarged organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials report that up to a third of chronically infected people later develop heart damage, even without new bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pets-and-wildlife-complicate-risk"&gt;Pets and wildlife complicate risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild mammals can act as a reservoir, an animal host that keeps a parasite circulating, near parks and neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bugs feed on infected animals, they pick up &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and carry it to the next blood meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs and other pets can also get infected, so veterinarians often advise indoor sleeping in areas with kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosis-and-reducing-exposure"&gt;Diagnosis and reducing exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinics rarely test for Chagas disease in the United States, because many patients show no clear symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; relies on blood tests that detect antibodies, which rise after exposure even when parasites hide in tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without routine screening and reporting, health systems struggle to track local cases and to warn clinicians in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home repairs and yard cleanup can reduce encounters with kissing bugs, especially when summer heat increases exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seal cracks, add tight window screens, and move firewood away from walls where adult bugs hide in shade. Bringing pets indoors at night and dimming porch lights cuts two attractions that pull insects close to doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-chagas-disease-parasites"&gt;Stopping Chagas disease parasites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local agencies can pair bug surveillance with public education, so residents know how to report insects and seek testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health departments can also map collections and prioritize outreach in areas where infected bugs cluster near schools, parks, and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those steps cannot erase the parasite from wildlife, but they can reduce contact and speed treatment when infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming year, Maldonado’s group plans to offer blood screening to El Paso residents who might face repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort would look for silent infections, then connect positive cases with medical follow-up before heart or gut disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanded testing of collected bugs could also clarify which parasite lineages circulate locally, a key step for long-term risk planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the borderland findings show how quickly a hard-to-detect parasite can move from desert habitats into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular monitoring, basic home protection, and earlier testing offer practical ways to limit transmission while researchers measure how common human infection is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/endemic-potential-of-chagas-disease-in-the-us-southwest-updated-surveillance-of-infected-triatomines-from-the-usmexico-border-region/0FED22EE81FB6EBEF7B80657FE93FF9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epidemiology and Infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:14:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNSWpRS3BOWVFsYUFld3d5bnpQQkIzQ0ZtTm1Nc2JSSDdtOVd1cW5weXZidERIMHJVQm9mZHlKRVl6d3VsdFNRdkdHZ24yY3VqbGphT0JObm1ZSkItZUtHTHNKRmZlU2poUGtvRmR5cHBMQlVEWTU5UXJtWjdVUndkQVQ1bU5FcW5vZHEtMDFKaDg5OFFBNG5mN0JWYThMSTdsSlBBeWtGY3VJZw</guid></item><item><title>这一变化可能会在2026年改变您的健康状况- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51428409/this-1-change-could-transform-your-health-in-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like your body is working against you? Gaining weight despite trying to eat healthy, feeling sluggish, foggy or just not like yourself? You're not alone. Millions of Americans are unknowingly battling what scientists and doctors call metabolic dysfunction: an epidemic quietly affecting nearly 9 in 10 adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden cost of the "Standard American Diet"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the U.S. government introduced official dietary guidelines in 1977, there has been a drastic shift in how food is produced and consumed. Healthy fats were vilified. Processed carbohydrates were promoted. And food manufacturers quickly replaced fat with sugar and refined starches in nearly everything from breakfast cereal to salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result? A skyrocketing rise in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and hormonal imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition insider, "Most people today aren't just overfed, they're misfed — living in a constant state of metabolic confusion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are carbs the culprit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While carbohydrates aren't inherently bad, the type and quantity matter. The average American consumes over 300 grams of carbs per day, much of it from ultra-processed sources. Excess carbs can spike insulin, the body's fat-storage hormone, and over time, lead to insulin resistance — the root of nearly every major chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of the three macronutrients, carbohydrates are the least necessary for the average adult and the most problematic for those struggling with metabolic problems," Bikman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why traditional dieting often backfires&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people try to cut calories or skip meals in an effort to lose weight, only to find themselves stuck, hungry, or regaining the weight months later. Bikman explained that while weight loss can happen with calorie restriction, it's often at the expense of lean muscle mass, which is critical for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Losing lean mass is one of the most harmful things that can happen in dieting," Bikman said. "It's not just about looking good. Muscle plays a central role in how our body manages energy, burns fat, and even protects against chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lose muscle, your metabolism slows. Your strength fades. And your body becomes even more resistant to fat loss. It leads to a frustrating cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of fats and protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cutting healthy sources of fat, we need to prioritize it — the right kinds, anyway. Healthy fats from sources like coconut, ghee, MCT oil, and olive oil help support hormone production, brain function, and metabolic flexibility. Pair that with complete proteins (including collagen, whey, and egg whites), and the body finally gets what it needs to burn fat, stay energized, and preserve muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But finding meals with the ideal ratio of protein, fat, and minimal carbs isn't easy, especially for busy people who don't want to cook five times a day or count every gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Utah-born shake that's changing the game&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That challenge led Bikman and a team of experts to create &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient-dense shake that delivers optimal macros, essential vitamins and minerals, and metabolism-supporting ingredients — all in one delicious, convenient meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman said that HLTH Code is a science-backed solution that gives your body exactly what it needs to thrive. Each shake offers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;27 grams of complete protein (from whey, egg whites, and collagen).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from coconut oil, olive oil, flaxseed, and MCTs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 4 grams net carbs, making it ideal for low-carb or keto diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prebiotic fiber, digestive enzymes, apple cider vinegar, probiotics and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no added sugars, no artificial ingredients, and no corners cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real people, real results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; across the country have now made HLTH Code a core part of their daily routine. Many report breakthroughs in fat loss, energy, mental clarity, digestion, and appetite control. The shakes are designed to be flexible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace one meal per day for general wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace two meals per day for weight loss or a metabolic reset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use as a pre- or post-workout fuel to support lean muscle gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the thousands of five-star reviews, here are just a handful that tell of the power of HLTH Code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David shared, "Lost 10 pounds in a week, coupled with intermittent fasting. Great product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry said, "I have lost 47 pounds using HLTH Code along with keto."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Cathy, "This meal replacement is delicious and satiating. I've been doing 2 shakes a day with one meal. This has helped me to lose 20 pounds in 3 months. Love it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Mark T said, "Even though this one was more expensive than the other ones I've taken, this one is the best. It curves my appetite and I'm actually losing weight because my body is finally getting fed dense nutrition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in delicious flavors like Creamy Vanilla, Chocolate Macadamia, and new &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/plant-based/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;plant-based options&lt;/a&gt;, HLTH Code makes it simple to eat for health without sacrificing taste or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this isn't just another shake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most meal replacements that focus only on calories or protein, HLTH Code was developed from the ground up to support whole-body health: better insulin sensitivity, more energy, fewer cravings, and sustained weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bikman puts it, "We didn't create HLTH Code to just be a 'diet shake.' We built it to be the healthiest meal you can have — and one you'd actually look forward to drinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Hlth Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've struggled with your weight, your energy, or your health, it's not your fault. We've all been misled by outdated food guidelines and quick-fix diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a better way, and thousands of people are now proving it every day.

                    &lt;p&gt;The family and friends of retired firefighter Ken Jones implored the city’s Health Service Board this week to persuade Blue Shield to reverse the denial of Jones’s crucial cancer treatment coverage through his city-run health plan, and many others have also been denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://missionlocal.org/2026/01/s-f-firefighters-demand-answers-after-blue-shield-denies-cancer-coverage/"&gt;As Mission Local reports&lt;/a&gt;, Ken Jones and other retired firefighters gathered with their families at City Hall this week asking the city’s health board to intervene over Blue Shield’s denial of coverage for numerous members. Supervisor Matt Dorsey, who’s an appointee on the board, said the city switched from United Health Care last year with the impression it would provide better options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today I'm forced to stand here and beg because an insurance company decided that profits matter more than the life of a man who spent his career protecting this city," said Jones’s daughter Rachel Jones at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He ran into burning buildings, inhaled toxic smoke, and put his life on the line again and again, so that others could survive,” Rachel Jones continued.  “Now, when he needs the help the most, the insurance company provided by this city through Blue Shield is denying him the medication his doctors say is necessary to keep him alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/post/san-francisco-firefighter-battling-stage-4-metastatic-lung-cancer-gets-treatment-denied-blue-shield-city-asked-intervene/18375388/"&gt;Per KGO&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey said the board will investigate the firefighters’ claims. “I don't think that's what this board signed up for when we made the decision on the basis of the RFP process,” said Dorsey, per KGO. “I lost my own mother to lung cancer, and she raised a son who was going to fight, to make sure that people get this care that they're entitled to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/sf-firefighter-cancer-treatment-denied-insurance/4011273/"&gt;As NBC Bay Area reports&lt;/a&gt;, a fundraiser was set up to cover the treatment that was previously denied for Jones’s stage 4 metastatic lung cancer, which was paused on Wednesday when he was informed Blue Shield had refused to pay. The campaign reached its &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/blue-shield-denying-delaying-ken-joness-cancer-treatment"&gt;$50,000 goal&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firefighters, whether active or retired, should never have to beg for their lives,” said former Fire Chief Jeanine Nicholson at the board hearing, who’s also a cancer survivor, per NBC Bay Area. “This is not the first firefighter this has happened to, nor will it be the last if something doesn’t change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Mission Local, &lt;a href="https://www.cpf.org/health-and-safety/firefighter-presumptions/cancer-presumption"&gt;California labor law&lt;/a&gt; dictates that cancer diagnoses for firefighters be automatically presumed as tied to their job duties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/s-f-firefighters-get-new-gear-free-21235433.php"&gt;As the Chronicle reported&lt;/a&gt; last month, the San Francisco Fire Department just became one of the first in the country to make the move toward equipping its staff with gear that’s free of cancer-causing “forever chemicals,” which leach into the body over time — on top of the toxic chemicals firefighters encounter during active fires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our firefighters give this city their best, and we owe them nothing less in return,” Mayor Daniel Lurie said at a press conference last month celebrating the move. Per the Chronicle, over 400 SF firefighters have died from cancer since 2006, according to the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the SF Health Service Board has had to step in over Blue Shield’s policies in the short time the company has been the city’s provider. In June, Supervisor Dorsey and SF City Attorney David Chiu &lt;a href="https://sfcityattorney.org/city-attorney-chiu-and-supervisor-dorsey-urge-blue-shield-to-keep-ucsf-in-network/"&gt;prompted the insurer&lt;/a&gt; to resolve a dispute with the University of California Health system that threatened access to care for thousands of members, including city and state workers, and an agreement &lt;a href="https://calretirees.org/Member-Resources/News/Details/uc-health-stays-in-network-for-calpers-blue-shield-members"&gt;was reached in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;

And studies show that patients who lose weight slash their risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and dementia, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid the frenzy, some experts are issuing warns over a possible future epidemic, linked to GLP-1 drugs that threatens to save years off otherwise healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Estes, an emergency medicine physician in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-566ce3a0-ebda-11f0-953f-db762ab9609b" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, told Daily Mail: 'One hundred percent of clients on weight loss drugs see at least some muscle loss. I don’t think anyone who is on actual weight loss doses will see zero percent muscle loss.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Douglas Ewing, a bariatric surgeon in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-2a172010-ef0c-11f0-95c5-2fd97e7ade78"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, added to Daily Mail: 'Less than five or 10 percent of patients complain about muscle loss, but it is something that probably more people than that would notice if you dug deeper. Muscle wasting is rarely symptomatic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are warning over a silent epidemic that could be caused by weight loss drugs. The above is a stock image of Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Estes pointed to analyses of eight large US and European studies, which suggest that, on average, 25 to 35 percent of the weight lost on the drugs is muscle, bone or other lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; has warned that the figure could be even higher, with some studies estimating that 40 to 60 percent of total weight loss is lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle is essential for movement, stability and overall health. Losing a significant amount raises the risk of falls and, with them, potentially debilitating injuries, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the average Ozempic user being 50 to 64 years old, according to the same KFF poll, experts fear the drugs could accelerate the muscle loss already experienced around that age and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11673557/Miracle-weight-loss-drug-trending-TikTok-cause-facial-aging.html"&gt;raise the risk of sarcopenia, progressive decline in muscle mass due to aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That increases the risk of falls that lead to head injuries, broken bones and other complications that can reduce lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But muscle loss could also affect younger adults in their 30s and 40s, experts say, if they suffer from falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Will Haas, a weight loss doctor in North Carolina, warned&lt;span&gt; 'I do believe that could be the potential if the trend isn't turned around and the right education and support are not in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If the nation sees people losing weight during their 30s and 40s, and also losing muscle mass, that trend could follow them well into other decades of life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alexandra Collett, 31, from the UK, lost 136lbs on Ozempic, but afterward found herself spending thousands removing loose skin and having a breast reduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that unintentional falls are already the leading cause of injury-related death among adults over the age of 65 years, with more than 41,000 dying from them every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death rate from falls among adults aged 65 years and older is also rising. The CDC said the rate increased 70 percent from 2003 to 2023 among adults aged 65 to 74 years, and more than 75 percent for those aged 75 to 84 years. Among the over-85s, it has more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear why this is happening, but experts have suggested it is down to the use opioids and antidepressants in older adults, which can cause dizziness and leave these adults at greater risk of losing their balance. Weight loss drugs may only add to this trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs are urged to eat a high-protein diet and do strength training at least twice a week to help prevent muscle loss while on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors report trouble getting patients to follow these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what proportion of patients on weight loss drugs may not be following diet or exercise recommendations, but in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC546419/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;comparable paper from 2004&lt;/a&gt;, where scientists tracked 4,000 obese adults taking prescription weight loss drugs, researchers found only 27 percent reported eating fewer calories and following the physical activity recommendations from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing added: 'Compliance, overall, is a difficult problem when you are dealing with diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have continual follow-up in the clinic, if you don't have the educational resources, if you don't have objective criteria, then you are less likely to be able to coax your patients slowly into better habits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Douglas Ewing, who raised concerns about the future because of weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that about 60 to 75 percent of patients at his clinic comply, but that when this does not happen, they provide patients with extra resources to encourage them to follow the diet and exercise recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All weight loss plans lead to at least some muscle loss, doctors say, but add that normally this is only around 15 to 20 percent of total weight lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Haas said that, for now, the benefits of weight loss drugs for obese individuals, when used with diet and exercise, outweigh the risks in his view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'For many patients, the rewards of true weight loss can absolutely outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes can include positive effects on blood sugar levels, blood pressure, sleep apnea, joint pain and quality-of-life changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it is not just a function to promote weight loss but to promote good health. This is best achieved through weight loss coupled with preservation of muscle mass, nutritional support, and lifestyle changes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other doctors disagreed that muscle wasting posed a major risk for users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Lofton, an obesity medicine expert in New York, told Daily Mail: 'There are scientific articles which have demonstrated that there is no excessive muscle wasting in patients taking GLP-1s versus those losing weight without meds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are expecting more people to start using weight loss drugs in the future (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important that the prescriber of GLP1s also provide the support for lifestyle management or refer to someone else skilled in such.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also warned that weight loss drugs may raise the risk of gallstones, or hard deposits, like tiny pebbles, that form from digestive fluid in the gallbladder, a gland near the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted the drugs may raise the risk of these complications because the rapid weight loss they cause can alter bile composition and reduce gallbladder emptying, causing bile to stagnate in the gland and become stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stones are painful, but can be removed with surgery. Patients generally do not suffer long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing told Daily Mail: 'I tell my patients gallstones and gallbladder problems are one thing they should keep in mind. Any time you lose weight, you risk developing these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We do see a lot of patients with gallbladder problems already. I can't really say whether we are seeing an uptick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:10:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRFhzaWMtYmQzd254N015dUNQSjN3bjlPQm9nQVY0UWs4WFZRZ3htOXRkcWczT2lyU0sxaUJRLV9lZF9sQjZhcEVlN2tJSTc2QjJMVnlSSDhVc1l4dGJPSU5mZjk2eUJheFU3aHNHeHdnVFhvMnMzOUlxUjI1bGJMX2ZMcjJzcnB3eWpqV29HUmxUUmxLczhtNzQxcw</guid></item><item><title>科学家们制造了这种片上肺呼吸。然后他们给了它结核病。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-made-this-lung-on-a-chip-breathe-then-they-gave-it-tb</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis has plagued humanity for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-bone-eating-pathogen-from-thousands-of-years-ago-is-still-circulating-inside-us"&gt;thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;, and despite medical advances that can now help us prevent and cure it, the ancient bacterial disease still &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;claims more human lives&lt;/a&gt; per year than any other infectious pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device meant to demystify the early stages of TB, including a peculiar delay that often precedes the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model could also reveal how genetic variations in patients lead to varying effects of TB, with potentially broad implications for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-crucial-reading-in-your-blood-can-predict-future-disease-risk"&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;a quarter of our species&lt;/a&gt; is infected with TB bacteria, and while only a fraction of those people will become sick, that still amounts to more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;10 million new cases&lt;/a&gt; – and more than 1 million deaths – per year worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB progresses slowly, with symptoms often taking months to appear. To learn more about this lag, the authors focused on tiny air sacs in the lungs, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-ve-found-a-brand-new-cell-type-in-our-lungs"&gt;pulmonary alveoli&lt;/a&gt;, which host pivotal confrontations between immune cells and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The air sacs in the lungs are a critical first barrier against infections in humans, but we've traditionally looked at them in animals like mice," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Max Gutierrez, who leads the Host-Pathogen Interactions in Tuberculosis Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These studies are fundamental for our understanding, but animals and humans have differences in the makeup of immune cells and disease progression, sparking interest in alternative technologies," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-recreate-a-whole-body-s-worth-of-organoids-just-one-millionth-of-the-size"&gt;organ-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt;" technology, for instance, lets scientists simulate a full human organ within a microfluidic cell culture microchip, offering an alternative to animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some "lung-on-a-chip" systems already exist, but limitations of those models inspired Gutierrez and his colleagues to try a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until now, lung-on-chip devices have been made of a mixture of patient-derived and commercially available cells," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This means that they can't fully recreate the lung function or disease progression of a single individual, as each type of cell is genetically different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers instead developed a new lung-on-a-chip for their study, featuring only genetically identical cells derived from a single human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used human induced pluripotent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which can virtually become any cell in the body, to produce type I and II alveolar epithelial cells," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; first author Jakson Luk, a postdoctoral fellow in Gutierrez's lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188105" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2.jpg" alt="lung-on-a-chip infected by TB bacteria" class="size-full wp-image-188105" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2-450x675.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188105" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A lung-on-chip infected by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, with cell nuclei in blue, dead macrophage in magenta, tight epithelial-endothelial junctions in yellow, and TB bacteria in white.

"Using the same stem cells, we also produced vascular endothelial cells that are grown on the bottom of the membrane."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offered a novel look at the 'black box' period of TB, or the time between a person's initial infection and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-ancient-disease-has-reappeared-in-the-us-this-could-be-why"&gt;onset of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to look for hallmarks of disease that have been reported in patients from the clinic and animal studies," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers added immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-trick-a-faulty-immune-system-into-repairing-the-gut-of-mice"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; to the chip before introducing TB, they soon noticed macrophage clusters with "necrotic cores" – a central group of dead macrophages nestled in a larger group of live ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, five days after infection, the endothelial and epithelial cell barriers collapsed, showing that the air sac function had broken down," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone's lungs react to TB the same way, however, so the researchers also sought to learn how genetic differences can lead to varying responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We removed the ATG14 gene, which is involved in a natural process for degrading damaged cells and foreign materials," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Macrophages lacking this gene were more susceptible to cell death in resting conditions, and tried to engulf more TB bacteria when infected, confirming the gene's role in keeping our immune defenses intact," he &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed, but Luk and his colleagues see their chip as a key step toward more personalized treatment of TB – and other infections, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could now build chips from people with particular genetic mutations to understand how infections like TB will impact them and test the effectiveness of treatments like antibiotics," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chip supports the big push into personalized medicine," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbt001x3b7awcb9j4lu@published"&gt;My wife and I recently had our second child (and last, we agreed). I am experiencing a totally new feeling: sexual emptiness. I feel like since the reproductive act has been completed, there is very little left to be interested in sexually. We’ve always had an intense but intermittent sex life, with me being the one taking initiative and pushing boundaries and my wife being scarcely available and allowing some of my fantasies to become true. It took a decade for my sexual enthusiasm to slowly fade, however sex always felt fun at least up until now. The new baby is here and I feel like it’s pointless to pursue and engage in sexual activities. I haven’t lost fantasies and desires but it’s all feeling very muffled. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to move past this moment and find a new approach to sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbt00203b7a5no83dqc@published"&gt;It is definitely common for parenthood to derail sex for at least a period of time. If you watched your wife give birth, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/postpartum-sex-advice-childbirth-husband-pregnancy.html"&gt;that could have something to do with your apathy&lt;/a&gt;, as depressing as that is. Also, the burdens of raising an infant can sap people of their will to do … well, just about everything. This may be an issue that you just need to give some time to in order to see improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="194" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00213b7a06j533ts@published"&gt;Beyond that, I think your current task is to attempt to untangle potential personal issues from relationship issues. Some guys’ libidos start to lag in their 40s (or even earlier). Sometimes this seems to be related to hormonal happenings (like decreased testosterone, which could be directly linked to fatherhood, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3182719/"&gt;according to some data&lt;/a&gt;). If I were you, I’d definitely get tests performed to see if there is anything happening on a biological level. You also express a level of grievance regarding your wife and her participation in your sex life. Is there stuff there to work through in counseling/sex therapy? Perhaps it would be helpful to get to the root of what’s happening, whether it’s related to the recent birth of your second child, something physiological, or a cooling off in your sexual relationship with your wife, which is typical of long-term relationships and may require some strategic distancing like that which Esther Perel recommends in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HB4HS1MOVRQP&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9TBgqJH8OXaXJ6KF-p0h2kiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqbntE_NQgtEeQ4z5Xh21yUfQMPho632oSNe9pk1FPgu8WwScI9LBbYConGrWU8sEJYCMm2JrfgmBFsP5NS6e9SxLQ43n-vgDAGtdzv58yXRWR7IYdMjsPx80ZTgKQF3ySydOH1oGpx9R7539r4sTK25qve4cilQVrQnN6griGllIP2KAfBlAYLZz-iJu-5CXXlY.buXEIn7oOzyuCyhuje0NowcjiXYnF1-wD6jG6v5he9w&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1767828185&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+c,aps,382&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it is some or all of these factors in concert. Each one will require different approaches, which is why someone working directly with you and your wife would be especially useful in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00233b7a5rc2g84j@published"&gt;I’ve found myself in love with a new man. Words do not describe how much better this world is with him in it. We are both highly sexual beings and our chemistry is what I’ve dreamed of. What’s interesting though, is that he has a more average-sized dick than what I’m used to (which I’m honestly obsessed with since we can have sex for hours—my previous partners were bigger and it would hurt after too long).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00243b7a8ij3x2f0@published"&gt;That said, I can’t seem to orgasm, either from penetrative sex or from deep clitoral grinding (both of which are tried and true for me). I am deeply at a loss. Is it because of his size? Something else I’m not clocking? We can go for so long and I’m used to having multiple orgasms in short sessions. He is talented with mouth and fingers, so that’s nice but … I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="165" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbu00273b7abios9eft@published"&gt;There is certainly a possibility that he’s just not hitting your spot the way bigger dicks from your past have. It’s encouraging, though, that you are “honestly obsessed” with his dick and want to have sex with him for hours despite the lack of penetrative orgasms. Maybe you take a note from Bottled Up below and learn to appreciate the journey over the destination. From what it sounds like, you’re well on your way. You say your new guy is talented with his mouth and fingers—does that mean you are orgasming from oral/manual sex? It is not at all uncommon for people to be able to come from one form of sex and not another. I understand your puzzlement over an apparent change potentially related to his dick size, but look: Find orgasms where you can. If he’s getting you off in some ways and you appreciate all the ways that you sexually engage with him, well, it sounds like you have a near-perfect situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idmbv00283b7alen8k69q@published"&gt;One thing you might try introducing is toys. Perhaps a vibrator would provide more clitoral stimulation during sex that could push you over the edge. A dildo of a size that you’re more accustomed to could theoretically give you the vaginal orgasms you crave. Introducing toys can be a dicey prospect for some partners, who may feel like they are being judged as lacking as a result, but if he’s generally game and his ego is sturdy, you can suggest this merely as a way to spice things up. If you have reliable ways to orgasm when you masturbate, you may want to consider introducing them as well. If you feel free enough to do so in bed without much conversation, that bodes well for your overall connection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkn002f3b7adjaiv5yl@published"&gt;I’m a middle-aged cis man, recently divorced and dating again. A familiar problem has returned: I take &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt; to get off. With my ex, we were able to get to a place where I could reliably orgasm during a healthy session (40 to 60 minutes) because we had figured out what worked and I felt comfortable. With new partners, it’s just not happening. I’m mostly fine with maintaining an erection but can’t get myself over the orgasmic hump. I remember this from my 20s and think it has something to do with a mix of anxiety and physical insensitivity. It’s not a huge deal for me, since I’ve learned to enjoy the journey and not just the destination, but it seems deflating to my partner. It’s worth noting that I’ve abused porn in the past and have basically sworn off both porn and masturbation these days. Any thoughts on ways to bring myself to a quicker orgasm, especially during PIV sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzko002h3b7a2hlazq02@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Bottled Up,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzko002i3b7aap5c97zx@published"&gt;This is tough! Delayed orgasm (DO)—the condition that you seem to be experiencing—is not easily treated. Appreciating the journey and not the   destination would be my primary piece of advice and you’re already there. Perhaps it might be useful to have a discussion with partners assuring them that you actually enjoy your marathons and aren’t nearly as concerned with your orgasm as they are. It’s great to be considerate and care about what your partner cares about, but you might invest a little bit less in what amounts to an irrational concern.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002j3b7at5pee2x5@published"&gt;Another bit of advice usually given here is to reduce porn use/masturbation, but you’re already doing that as well. I showed your letter to my go-to urology source, Charles Welliver, director of men’s health in the department of urology at Albany Medical College, who replied via email that he felt that he’d figured out the issue until the end of your letter, when you mentioned your masturbation/porn abstinence. Foiled again!&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002k3b7aiv3qhrrp@published"&gt;Welliver said that he’d inquire as to whether or not you are on SSRIs, which can cause delayed orgasm, and he’d also potentially prescribe cabergoline, a medicine that works on the brain’s dopamine receptors and is typically prescribed to treat high prolactin levels. It can sometimes speed things up. (In Welliver’s experience, it has around a 50 percent success rate.) He has heard of others using oxytocin intranasal spray, but like the rest of the off-label medicines sometimes used to treat delayed orgasm (bupropion and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine [Adderall], among them), the data is scant. What you’re experiencing isn’t necessarily in need of a medical solution, though—especially considering that, as you said, this isn’t really a problem for you. I’m just letting you know what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002l3b7aksu26owp@published"&gt;You could also take this as an opportunity to explore. Sometimes new stimulation or scenarios can change orgasm time. If there’s anything you find hot but haven’t yet experienced, now’s the time. Prostate stimulation, in particular, can reliably speed up orgasm for some guys, and that can be achieved as easily as wearing a prostate massager (like the kind &lt;a href="https://www.aneros.com/"&gt;Aneros&lt;/a&gt; makes) during sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk7idzkp002m3b7akaab7er3@published"&gt;You can read a more detailed breakdown on the research on DO &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/01/delayed-ejaculation-orgasm-anorgasmia-men-ssri-testosterone-advice.html"&gt;in this past column&lt;/a&gt;. Some other potential paths to consider are getting your thyroid levels checked (hypothyroid patients often experience DO) as well as sex therapy (which may or may not involve penile vibratory stimulation, which has a bit of &lt;a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382163/"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing improvement in anorgasmic men). Delayed orgasm may be difficult to address, but it’s not impossible, so have hope and don’t let your concerns get in the way of the good time you’re already having.&lt;/p&gt;

All of my serious relationships have been long-distance and I am new to the in-person dating and hookup scene. I’ve been having a lot of success and fun, but I still have one problem: I don’t like kissing mouth-to-mouth. Mouth on the body is fine. It just grosses me out and turns me off. People seem really bothered and insulted by this, but I don’t care—I don’t like it, and I don’t want to do it. How can I convince my partners that that’s really all there is to it? &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/kissing-norms-insults-sex-advice.html"&gt;Why is it so hard to opt-out of this particular act?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“How did you sleep?” You might answer that question by weighing how many hours you slept or how often you woke up throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a third, often neglected, element of sleep to consider, experts say. It’s the consistency of your sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep consistency refers to how well you maintain the same bedtime and wake-up time, give or take 30 minutes — and that includes weekends, said Jean-Philippe Chaput, a professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that most adults in the United States do not have a consistent sleep schedule. And that may be harming their health, Chaput said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the research indicates &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the science on the link between inconsistent sleep and poor health is based on observational studies, which can’t prove cause and effect. Their results are also often restricted by various limitations (including if the study was performed on a small number of people, or on people of only certain ages, ethnicities or occupations). It’s also difficult to accurately track people’s sleep patterns over months or years, and some studies define sleep consistency in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, scientists have found some patterns. Those who tend to deviate most from a consistent sleep schedule seem to be at higher risk of certain health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 2,000 adults aged 45 to 84 in the United States. They concluded that those with the most irregular sleep schedules were more than twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those with more regular sleep patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study published in 2024, researchers analyzed sleep data from more than 88,000 adults in the United Kingdom and assigned “sleep regularity” scores to all of them. Those who scored lowest, meaning they had the most irregular sleep schedules, were about 50% more likely to develop dementia than those who scored in the middle of the range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t sure how frequent or how severe your sleep irregularity has to be to increase your health risk, said Soomi Lee, an associate professor of sleep and aging at Penn State. But the more you deviate from your typical sleep time — whether that’s within a 24-hour period or across weeks or months — the more the risks seem to increase, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large review of studies published in 2023, a group of sleep scientists concluded that there was enough evidence to recommend maintaining a regular sleep schedule to help protect metabolic, mental and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why inconsistent sleep may put health at risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still untangling why inconsistent sleep patterns might negatively affect health, but their leading theory has to do with the body’s circadian rhythm, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your circadian rhythm makes up a roughly 24-hour internal clock that governs your sleep-wake cycle as well as the ebbs and flows of your hormones, metabolism, cardiovascular function, immune system, appetite and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stray from your typical sleep schedule, the bodily functions that rely on those rhythms are thrown off, too. For example, staying up late or sleeping in may affect your hormone levels. Cortisol, which regulates stress, could be released at odd times or in more erratic ways. This can increase stress and inflammation throughout the body that, over time, may affect cardiovascular or metabolic health, Chaput said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A misaligned circadian rhythm may also cause you to feel hungry outside of your regular mealtimes, said Dr. Andrew Varga, an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. That could lead you to eat at unusual hours, such as late at night, possibly resulting in digestive issues or, in the long run, weight gain or obesity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to keep sleep consistent &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With work, school, parenting demands and social obligations, it can be challenging to sleep consistently. But experts have some tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting an alarm to go off an hour before your bedtime every night can remind you that it’s time to start getting ready for sleep, Varga said. Doing something relaxing during that hour, such as reading or meditating, can help you wind down for bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to expose yourself to sunlight every morning — ideally for 20 to 30 minutes at the same time every day, said Dr. Nishay Chitkara, director of sleep medicine at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue. While standing in front of a window can be beneficial, he said, it’s best to go outside to do this, even if it’s cloudy. A bright artificial indoor light, like a light therapy box, can help, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light is the main cue that regulates your circadian rhythm. When it hits your eyes in the morning, your body begins its countdown to later that evening — when it releases hormones telling your body it’s time to go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not feel exhausted from inconsistent sleep in the same way you might after a night of tossing and turning, Lee added. But try your best to stick with a sleep routine regardless. The more consistent you are, she said, the better your health will be in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Trump administration announcement was led by prominent vaccine critic and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/07/us-vaccine-schedule-guidelines-change" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK, Australia, and Denmark&lt;/a&gt; only recommend the RSV shot for high-risk newborns because those countries all recommend the vaccine during pregnancy. Additionally, those countries have universal healthcare – which the US does not – which means everyone is able to visit the doctor regularly and receive the vaccines. In the US, where care is much more fragmented, only about a third of pregnant people receive the shot, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Infections and hospitalizations from the virus, which is particularly dangerous for young children, are beginning to ramp up in the US this respiratory season. But in recent years, doctors and parents have seen a major decrease in severe illness among babies who received the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s easy to see in real life. We can really tell that hospitalizations are down,” said Richard Rupp, professor in pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and the interim director of the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, who as a researcher was involved with the trials of RSV shots for newborns. “It’s made a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Four studies in Jama confirm these observations, echoing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/rsv-cases-decline-vaccines-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous data&lt;/a&gt; showing a significant decline in hospitalization because of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This time of year, hospitals used be full of babies struggling to breathe because of RSV; sometimes, they would run out of beds for all of them. Doctors like Rupp are now worried restricting the shots will make RSV hospitalizations surge once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vast majority (81%) of babies hospitalized with RSV have no underlying conditions. Giving the shot only to children with existing health issues will “miss a large majority of the potential cases”, says Kevin Ault, an obstetrician-gynecologist and a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/vaccines-rfk-jr-cdc-acip-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now-defunct&lt;/a&gt; RSV working group at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s very concerning, and that’s why a universal recommendation was made,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rupp called RSV “a horrible disease” and described how it can manifest in a patient: “At first, it might seem like a child has a little cold, but then things can change – and quickly. In an hour or two, it can turn the other way,” with the child “fighting for every breath … The fear is always that they’ll just stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;RSV vaccination during pregnancy is 70% effective at preventing hospitalization, and the shot given to newborns to prevent RSV was even better, at 81% effective, one study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2843213?resultClick=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. The newborn shot is more effective at preventing child hospitalization compared to the pregnancy shot, though both worked well, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2843212" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a second study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, the RSV shot for infants appears to prevent hospitalization from all lower-respiratory infections, a third study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2842555" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. That’s likely because RSV can cause lingering effects, such as bacterial infections. And the vaccines are safe to give during pregnancy, a fourth study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2843668?guestAccessKey=c3bd4ace-ce5c-4fcc-9396-5ccc68c7a6ba&amp;amp;utm_source=fbpage&amp;amp;utm_medium=social_jama&amp;amp;utm_term=19181941763&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert&amp;amp;linkId=896361963&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawPM8vpleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFBcU5VcXBjeDNRQ3dyTkJqc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHgy9_vpdB65oedK5MizeO2yRwvTX_Qovh0H0p4r4grK2pXuzDEdSISyAsK4w_aem_j-fF0moK6PnSzGo1lE3Uiw" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. In the clinical trials, there was a statistically insignificant possibility of preterm birth, but this follow-up study found no such relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prior to the shots, which were approved in 2023, 2 to 3% of babies in the US were hospitalized with RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s the most common reason for children under five to be hospitalized,” said Ault. RSV has also been linked with developing asthma, a lifelong condition that can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shots given to infants aren’t typical vaccines; they are monoclonal antibodies, or lab-made antibodies that help the babies fight off the virus for several months, until the protection fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts were surprised when the Trump administration began targeting the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was caught, I’ve got to say, flat-footed on the whole RSV thing,” Rupp said. “I was surprised, because this sort of seems like an attack on monoclonal antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With Covid, even people who were opposed to vaccination have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/21/monoclonal-antibodies-covid-treatment-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eager&lt;/a&gt; to get the monoclonal antibody treatments, Rupp pointed out. Earlier versions of monoclonal antibodies to fight RSV have been given to children for decades without any safety signals emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I could not even imagine that we would be at this spot with anybody even doubting that it was something that should be available for all the kids,” Rupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ault said the decision was “made by political appointees without a scientific basis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tracy Beth Høeg, who was recently named the top drugs regulator at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claimed recently&lt;/a&gt; that babies in the clinical trials had a higher death rate – but she also noted that it was not statistically significant. Even so, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the safety of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were three &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinault.bsky.social/post/3lrl5j52i5k2c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the trials, Ault said, “but they were months and months and months after the vaccine, and they were due to things like dehydration”. The shots have since rolled out to millions of infants with no known safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The limitations on shots will further erode access to them – even for babies who are deemed high risk, Ault said, adding: “If you start having [more] fragmentation of the system, you’re going to see hospitals and offices not stocking it. So even if it’s covered on paper, it might not be available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This decision means hospitals, pediatricians, and state and local governments are now scrambling, during RSV season, to figure out best practices, Ault said, which will likely result in confusion about who should stock and administer the shots. A pediatrician might assume a baby got the shot at the hospital, while hospitalists might believe the parents need to talk to their pediatrician first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s a quick breakdown in coordination and coverage that way,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than half of children in the US receive their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program. While officials have said the restricted shots will still be available through Medicaid and other federal programs, experts worry that could change with the stroke of a pen from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody’s big concern is whether or not it will be covered by insurance and by the Vaccines for Children program,” Rupp said. “Those are the people who really will not be able to afford to have this for their children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s also another complication – though it could work in patients’ favor. It’s not clear exactly which children are now recommended to get the RSV shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s no defined ‘high risk’,” Ault said. Because of the high hospitalization rate for babies with no preexisting conditions, simply being an infant should make them eligible for the shot, Rupp and Ault both said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All babies in the first few months of life are at high risk for RSV,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQNG4xeE9nRFgtZzVCclZMNUdjWVlvMVNZMEtqQ1NEQlpwaXZ4NnphXzB5SGpBbVI1M1Z5RVEyeThnUzlOTlVCdkIycWszYnpKRFJqRnY3bXVkNV8ydFpRakhybkF5azdTUzdVeWRyWGRKdnJ6SnhrNVItcEtnZzQ</guid></item><item><title>如果您年满60岁，并且仍然毫不费力地完成这9件事，那么您的大脑老化得非常好- Silicon Canals</title><link>https://siliconcanals.com/a-bt-if-youre-over-60-and-still-do-these-9-things-effortlessly-your-brain-is-aging-remarkably-well/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Silicon Canals</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNdjlpWHFCd2ZCSERkR2hkbml0Tnc0U09aT0xLWVFEck5mX3ZMTHdBR2thblVidS1SZ2ZJTkdYVkh2akhnc1VoRGpSOEE0ZzNzMXF4UFhRNHFTU0tmbVJHcldqemFlR3k1OXJ3WWZvNl93Y1NnRHp6czVFeEIzOGFXN3d2cUxwa0Zma0xXTDg2MGNhWHlfOTRwR0dYWW5ZeWlHd1Bka3B6RlFiU0lSUExsT0JPSVFGYUVxMV9sZUNaZzE5WjQ</guid></item><item><title>您的心脏不在乎您有多年轻：心脏病专家恳求您放弃的神话-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/health/your-heart-doesnt-care-how-young-you-are-the-myths-cardiologists-beg-you-to-drop/articleshow/126462036.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease still carries this strange reputation. Something that happens later. To someone else. To people who didn’t take care of themselves. And yet, cardiologists are seeing younger patients walk into clinics every week with symptoms they ignored because they believed the wrong things for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the deal: your heart doesn’t care how young you are, how busy life is, or how many times you’ve told yourself you’ll “deal with it later.” Heart disease is quietly the world’s number one killer, and it’s not just something that happens to “other people.” Every year, nearly 20 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-%28cvds%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organisation report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), which include heart attacks and strokes, and that’s nearly one-third of all deaths around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes heart disease so sneaky is how it shows up, or doesn’t show up. Lots of damage happens long before anyone feels anything. High blood pressure creeps up quietly. Levels of blood sugar, lipids, and inflammation rise without obvious discomfort. The early signs can be stuff you shrug off: fatigue, breathlessness, weird aches, an off day that just won’t quit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s another part of the puzzle: people often don’t get checked until it’s almost too late. As per a survey by Wockhardt Hospitals, doctors say only about 35 per cent of people go for preventive heart check-ups, the rest show up only after symptoms appear. That means conditions that could have been caught early go undetected until there’s a crisis. Add to that the heartbreaking statistic, as per a 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10442961/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;that only 11 per cent of heart attack patients reach hospitals in what doctors call the “golden hour,” the first hour when treatment makes the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are we up against? Unhealthy diets, cigarettes, stress, inactivity, pollution, these risk factors are everywhere. They stack up over years, quietly making arteries stiffer, blood pressure higher, and the heart’s job heavier. And the worst part? Half the people who die of heart disease never saw it coming. Many young adults think they’re “too young” for a heart problem. They’re not. Rates of heart attacks in people under 40 have risen sharply in recent years, with stress and modern lifestyles being big contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when cardiologists say “forget these myths,” they’re not being dramatic. They’re fighting an epidemic that doesn’t shout, doesn’t wait, and definitely doesn’t care how young you are. Your heart works every second of your life, wouldn’t it make sense to learn how to listen back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bipin Kumar Dubey, HOD, Cardiology and Principal Director, Interventional Cardiology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka, these myths aren’t harmless. Dr. Ranjan Modi, Senior Consultant, Interventional Cardiology at Medanta Hospital, Noida, tells TOI Health many patients don’t miss the signs because they don’t care. They miss them because they believe the wrong stories about how heart disease works. They delay treatment. And sometimes, they cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors have debunked a few common myths around heart disease that stops people from taking medical advice and hence delays treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I’m too young for heart trouble”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most dangerous belief of all. Yes, heart disease becomes more common with age. But today’s lifestyle has changed the timeline. Long work hours, constant stress, smoking, poor sleep, little movement, and processed food have pushed heart risk into the 30s and even 20s. Dr Dubey often sees younger adults shocked by a diagnosis they never thought applied to them. And that shock usually comes after warning signs were brushed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“If it was serious, I’d feel chest pain”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies have done real damage here. Not every heart problem shows up as crushing chest pain. Some people feel breathless for no clear reason. Others feel unusually tired, dizzy, nauseous, or have pain in the jaw, back, or arm. Women, especially, tend to have quieter symptoms. But quiet doesn’t mean harmless. And waiting for dramatic pain can mean waiting too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I’m thin, I exercise sometimes, I should be fine”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being slim doesn’t give your heart a free pass. Cholesterol levels, blood sugar, smoking, stress, and family history matter just as much, sometimes more. Dr Dubey points out that many patients look “healthy” on the outside but have serious issues inside. The heart doesn’t care about appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Exercise is risky once you have heart issues”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth keeps people stuck in fear. While random, intense workouts can be harmful, guided and moderate exercise is often part of recovery. Movement strengthens the heart. Avoiding it completely can actually make things worse. The key is doing it with medical advice, not guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“It’s genetic, so why bother”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes matter, but they’re not the whole story. Lifestyle choices still carry huge weight. Regular check-ups, better food, movement, and stress control can slow or even prevent problems, even if heart disease runs in the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Women don’t need to worry as much”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in women, and symptoms are often missed or misread. That’s why awareness and routine screening matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Treatment means I’m cured”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A procedure or pill isn’t the finish line. It’s the beginning of long-term care. Follow-ups, medication, and lifestyle changes keep the heart stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if there’s one thing Dr Dubey stresses, it’s this: don’t argue with symptoms. Listen to your body. Act early. The heart rarely gives a second warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“My cholesterol is normal, so I’m safe”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol gets all the attention, but heart disease doesn’t work on a single number. Blood pressure, blood sugar, smoking, weight, stress levels, lack of movement, and family history all play a role. Dr. Modi often reminds patients that heart risk is about the full picture. Normal cholesterol is good news, but it’s not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Once I start heart medicines, I’m stuck forever”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not always. Some medications are protective and may be adjusted or reduced if lifestyle changes and medical control improve over time. But stopping medicines on your own is risky. Dr. Modi stresses that changes should always happen under medical guidance. Sudden stops can trigger serious events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“If I don’t feel anything, nothing’s wrong”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most dangerous heart conditions stay silent. High blood pressure, diabetes, and even coronary artery disease can develop without obvious symptoms. Many people only discover them after a heart attack or stroke. Regular checkups catch what feelings can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I exercise, so my diet doesn’t matter much”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise helps. But it doesn’t cancel out poor food choices. Processed foods, excess sugar, and too much salt still strain the heart, even in active people. Heart health is built on daily habits, not just workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the truth is simple. The heart rarely fails overnight. It gives signals. We just need to stop ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的研究揭示了2008年大萧条引发的心理转变- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/new-research-reveals-a-psychological-shift-triggered-by-the-2008-great-recession/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that the 2008 Great Recession did more than damage the economy; it also altered how Americans perceive their own social standing. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251400338" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, indicate that this period of economic turmoil caused a lasting drop in class identity across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have traditionally viewed class identity as a stable trait. Most Americans tend to identify as working class or middle class, and these self-conceptions usually persist throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical data going back to the 1940s supports the idea that these identities do not fluctuate easily. Consequently, there has been little empirical work examining whether class identity can change over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study sought to challenge the assumption of stability. Theoretical models suggest that class identity should be malleable when people experience drastic changes in their circumstances. The 2008 Great Recession provided a unique historical context to test these theories on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While class identity is known to predict critical outcomes like health and voting behavior, it has historically been treated as a static trait that remains stable throughout adulthood,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.antonoplis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stephen Antonoplis&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the University of California, Riverside and director of &lt;a href="https://saslab.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Self and Society Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to test this assumption by investigating whether a massive, nationwide economic shock, specifically the 2008 Great Recession, shifted how people see themselves in the social hierarchy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the financial crisis, many Americans faced tangible losses in the form of unemployment and foreclosures. At the same time, the cultural narrative shifted. The rise of movements like Occupy Wall Street popularized language about the “1%” versus the “99%.” This rhetoric emphasized that most Americans occupied a lower position relative to the economic elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this phenomenon, the researchers analyzed data from four large datasets. These included the American National Election Studies, the General Social Survey, and the World Values Survey. These three datasets used repeated cross-sectional designs, meaning they surveyed different groups of people each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also utilized the Health and Retirement Study. This dataset is longitudinal, meaning it tracks the same individuals over many years. This design allowed the researchers to observe changes within the lives of specific people. In total, the study included data from 164,296 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The datasets covered a broad span of time, ranging from decades before the recession to years after. The sample was largely representative of the United States population in terms of gender, race, and education. This large sample size provided high statistical power to detect population-level shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers employed a statistical method called interrupted time-series modeling. This technique analyzes the trend of a variable leading up to a specific event. It then identifies if there is a sudden change in level at the time of the event. Finally, it looks at the trend in the years following the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class identity was measured using two different approaches. Three of the surveys asked participants to choose a label that best described their social class. Options typically included categories such as lower class, working class, middle class, and upper class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health and Retirement Study used a visual measure known as the MacArthur Ladder. Participants were shown a drawing of a ladder with ten rungs representing society. They were asked to place themselves on the rung that reflected their standing relative to the people who are best and worst off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the American National Election Studies showed a clear pattern. In the years leading up to 2008, class identity among Americans had been gradually increasing. However, the data revealed a drop in class identity starting in 2008. Following this decline, identity levels began to recover slowly in the subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The General Social Survey yielded similar results regarding the immediate impact of the recession. Class identity appeared relatively stable in the decades prior to the crash. In 2008, there was a negative shift in how participants identified themselves. Unlike the previous dataset, this survey indicated that identity levels did not bounce back and remained lower for the next fourteen years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study provided perhaps the strongest evidence. Because this survey followed the same people, it controlled for differences between generations. These participants reported linear increases in their perceived status leading up to the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the recession hit, these same individuals reported a sharp decline in their social standing. This drop was significant compared to what would have been expected based on their previous positive trends. The analysis showed that the recession disrupted the upward trajectory of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were particularly struck by the consistency of the findings across such diverse datasets, including the fact that the drop was visible within the lives of the same individuals over time, as well as the fact that results from most datasets indicated that Americans’ class identity had not increased considerably in the years following the recession,” Antonoplis told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Values Survey was the only dataset that produced slightly different results. It showed a decrease in class identity in the decades prior to 2008. While the data did show a decrease in 2008, the drop was not statistically significant in this specific model. However, the overall pattern across the four studies points toward a real effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that class identity is not set in stone. It appears to be responsive to the economic and cultural environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that people’s sense of ‘where they stand’ in society is not set in stone,” Antonoplis explained. “It is dynamic and responsive to the world around them, including both changes in their finances or employment and changes in the broader culture, such as messaging about economic threat and wealth discrepancies. Our results also suggest that major economic events don’t just change our bank accounts—they change our sense of self and our relationship to society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the numerical shifts might look small at first glance, they represent a significant ‘level drop’ across the entire American population. Because class identity is such a powerful driver of health, well-being, and political leanings, even a modest downward shift can have large aggregate effects on public health and national discourse. It is the difference between a society that feels well off and one that feels collectively demoted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations. The research relied on self-reported data, which can be influenced by various biases. Additionally, while the time-series design helps infer causality, it is difficult to isolate the recession from other events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the election of Barack Obama occurred around the same time as the financial crisis. However, the authors argue that this event is unlikely to be the cause. The election represented a moment of hope for many and occurred after the recession had already begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore the mechanisms behind this shift in greater detail. Scientists want to understand if personal financial loss or media exposure played a bigger role. It is also unclear if this drop in identity led to specific changes in people’s attitudes or mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, did changes in class identity following the Great Recession produce changes in people’s political views or social values?” Antonoplis said. “Did the change in class identity affect people’s psychological well-being?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research was made possible by decades of data collection from thousands of Americans who participated in national surveys since the 1950s and by decades of federal government funding for social science research,” the researcher added. “Our study serves as a reminder of how valuable long-term social science infrastructure is for understanding the psychological consequences of history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this study encourages more researchers to look at identity as something that evolves alongside the world we live in and that it inspires lawmakers to continue funding vital research in the social sciences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251400338" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The 2008 Great Recession Lowered Americans’ Class Identity&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Stephen Antonoplis, Juan Eduardo Garcia-Cardenas, Eileen K.

The new recommendation means &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/07/12/bonus-shots-the-benefits-of-vaccines-no-one-tells-you-about/"&gt;fewer vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Health officials will continue to recommend the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and those against polio, chickenpox and HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now they are only recommending vaccinations against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B, and hepatitis A to children who broadly face a higher risk of infections. The move is not a surprise to health officials nationwide, as it was &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/18/health/hhs-childhood-vaccine-changes"&gt;reported by CNN late last month&lt;/a&gt;. But it does reflect a bigger fallacy that has long surrounded the vaccine debate and been a talking point of anti-vaccine campaigns: if they do it in Europe, they can do it in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A major fallacy is assuming that policies that work in one country will automatically work in another,” Josh Michaud, the associate director of global health and public health policy at KFF, told Salon. “European countries differ significantly from the U.S. in terms of demographics, health care systems, social safety nets, and public health infrastructure, all of which shape their policy choices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michaud said the U.S. has its own scientific institutions and experts who are capable of reviewing evidence and developing guidelines specific for the country. “Relying on guidelines developed elsewhere risks overlooking local conditions and realities that matter for effective public health policy,” Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud pointed out that when it comes to European comparisons, there is also “selected use” of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p class="insert-quote"&gt;“Relying on guidelines developed elsewhere risks overlooking local conditions and realities that matter for effective public health policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many European countries have universal health coverage, stronger social welfare programs, and stricter gun laws than the U.S., yet those policies are rarely cited as models by officials here,” he said. “Instead, the focus has been narrowly placed on Denmark’s vaccine recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud said that experts across peer countries generally agree on “the underlying science of vaccine safety and efficacy.” It’s not that Denmark doesn’t recommend some vaccines because they’re not safe, but instead because of differences of the data and how that data is applied within the context of each country and its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-does-denmark-recommend-so-few-childhood-vaccines-danish-scientist-explains"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Jens Lundgren, an infectious disease specialist at the Copenhagen University Hospital, who said vaccine schedules should be based on a population’s needs. For example, when asked about meningococcal diseases, Lundgren said it’s not really a “public health problem” in Denmark. “We feel that there are other vaccines that should be higher on the list at the moment, at least in the Danish context,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s problematic to base U.S. vaccine policy on simply copying another country,” Michaud said. “Vaccine decisions depend on factors that vary widely across nations, including health care delivery systems, insurance coverage, public health capacity, and national priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added Denmark is not a good model for the U.S. to follow because it is “an outlier among peer countries.” Of the countries that the HHS compared the U.S. to, Denmark is the only one to recommend vaccines against as few as 10 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics said the move from the HHS was “dangerous and unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United States is not Denmark, and there is no reason to impose the Danish immunization schedule on America’s families,” Dr. Andrew Racine, AAP’s president, said in a statement. “America is a unique country, and Denmark’s population, public health infrastructure, and disease-risk differ greatly from our own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racine said that the AAP will continue to publish its own childhood vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What concerns many public health experts is the confusion this will cause parents in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reclassifying vaccines for six diseases from routine recommendations to “shared clinical decision-making” adds complexity for both providers and parents,” Michaud said. “Combined with mixed messaging from the CDC, clinicians and other groups, this change risks reducing vaccination rates and increasing cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capsule, built with a zinc-cellulose antenna and an ultra-small &lt;strong&gt;RFID chip&lt;/strong&gt;, emits a radio signal once swallowed, allowing healthcare providers to verify medication intake in real time. Most of the device safely degrades inside the digestive tract, with only the tiny chip passing through the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of system could be especially valuable for patients who require strict medication adherence, such as those recovering from organ transplants or undergoing long-term treatment for infections like HIV or tuberculosis. According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, failure to take medication as prescribed is a widespread issue that contributes to over 125,000 preventable deaths and more than $100 billion in avoidable healthcare costs every year in the United States alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project, led by &lt;em&gt;MIT’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/12957/carlo-traverso-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Giovanni Traverso&lt;/a&gt;, also a gastroenterologist at &lt;em&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/em&gt;, is part of a broader push to develop patient-friendly monitoring tools that don’t rely on wearable devices or invasive procedures. Researchers believe that integrating these capsules into existing treatment plans could help bridge critical gaps in medication adherence, especially in vulnerable or high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bioresorbable System Designed for Patient Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The capsule’s key feature lies in its degradability. The zinc-based antenna is embedded in a cellulose matrix and paired with a micro-RFID chip that does not require a &lt;strong&gt;battery&lt;/strong&gt;. As detailed in the MIT &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111706" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the outer coating (made from gelatin and a biodegradable metal such as molybdenum or tungsten) forms a Faraday cage that initially blocks signal emission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once ingested, the capsule begins to dissolve in the stomach. Within minutes, the shielding layer breaks down, activating the antenna and triggering a signal to an external reader. The signal is detected up to two feet away and can confirm the pill’s ingestion within &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the research team, nearly all components of the system degrade within the body over the course of a few days, except the RFID chip, which is safely excreted. &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JcXKJhsAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mehmet Girayhan Say&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lead authors, emphasized that the materials were selected for their safety profiles and compatibility with medical and environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Applications and Real-Time Monitoring Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This technology is not designed for casual over-the-counter use, but rather for clinical settings where medication adherence is critical. One such population is transplant recipients, who must take immunosuppressants on a strict schedule to prevent organ rejection. Another target group includes people undergoing treatment for chronic infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In swine models, the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/dinosaur-eggs-hold-ultimate-time-capsule/" data-type="post" data-id="100249"&gt;capsule &lt;/a&gt;successfully transmitted its signal from inside the stomach to an external receiver, even when the tag was floating in gastric fluid. As shown in in vivo imaging and tracking tests, the antenna remained operational for long enough to confirm ingestion, and then safely dissolved without causing blockage or harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67551-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SAFARI project&lt;/a&gt; (Smart Adherence via FARaday cage And Resorbable Ingestible) the ultimate goal is to offer a passive, hands-off way to log ingestion events that could then be linked to patient health records. The capsule design is also compatible with existing &lt;strong&gt;gelatin &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;HPMC capsules&lt;/strong&gt;, which streamlines integration into pharmaceutical workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eco-Conscious Materials and Minimal Health Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its clinical usefulness, the MIT capsule addresses growing concerns about &lt;strong&gt;medical waste&lt;/strong&gt; and environmental sustainability. Current ingestible electronics often use non-degradable materials, which accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract or contribute to electronic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the SAFARI capsule uses zinc and cellulose (both biodegradable and already approved for use in healthcare (along with a dissolvable protective coating. The team reports that the zinc antenna degrades at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;120 nanometers per day&lt;/strong&gt;, and Mo-based shielding disintegrates within hours after exposure to gastric fluids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from blood serum tests in animal studies showed no significant increase in zinc or molybdenum levels post-ingestion. According to the MIT researchers, both elements are essential trace nutrients, and their quantities in the device are far below known toxicity thresholds. This makes the capsule not only safe for repeated use but also well-positioned for broader &lt;strong&gt;clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now preparing for human trials and envision wearable or portable receivers that could be integrated into daily routines, offering healthcare providers near-instant feedback on whether a dose was taken, without requiring any extra effort from the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

So this is really something that I think more people should think about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn noted that the average American doesn’t need to supplement their diet with extra protein because they’re probably already getting the recommended daily allowance in their meals. However, if we are looking for more protein, she urged us to get it from whole foods, rather than processed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that there’s protein in most foods, which means even people who don’t eat meat shouldn’t need to work too hard to get their daily needs met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as you’re making a concerted effort as a vegetarian to eat a lot of different plants, like, you’re gonna get as much protein as you need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelson noted that “a cup of spinach ... has five grams of protein in it, a cup of raw peas has eight grams of protein ... wild rice has six grams of protein in a cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains are also a “huge source of protein,” Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not just talking about quinoa — oats have a lot of protein in them, things like seeds, like hemp seeds and chia seeds, have a lot of protein ... It adds up a lot faster than you think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve been anxious about not getting enough protein, worry not! You probably are, but if you want an extra boost, reach for whole foods — and maybe skip processed meats as a regular part of your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also chatted with Dunn about why we’re wasting our time and money if we’re getting too much protein, which nutrient we should probably be focusing on instead of protein, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the full episode above or &lt;a href="https://pod.link/1707391801" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="wherever you get your podcasts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6961173ee4b0120ab25d18a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pod.link/1707391801" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;wherever you get your podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a question or need some help with something you’ve been doing wrong?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best breakfast for high blood pressure is high in protein, fiber and leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein and fiber help keep blood sugar steady, which in turn affects blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach provide dietary nitrates that improve blood flow and circulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast can be an easy way to start the day with nutrients your body needs to feel and function well. A balanced morning meal helps provide fiber, protein and key vitamins and minerals that support steady energy and overall health. Research suggests that people who eat breakfast regularly often have healthier eating habits and may be less likely to have high blood pressure, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-avoid-to-reduce-stroke-risk-11783242" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;major risk factor for heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

He stresses the importance of eating a breakfast rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and dietary nitrates from dark leafy greens. These nutrients help prevent blood glucose spikes and insulin resistance, which both contribute to elevated blood pressure. And this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt; is a smart way to support healthy blood pressure first thing in the day. Protein-rich eggs help you feel satisfied, while fiber from whole-grain toast and raspberries supports steadier blood sugar and appetite control. Spinach adds potassium and other nutrients that play a role in blood vessel function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together, this protein-, fiber- and leafy green-packed breakfast delivers lasting energy without weighing you down, making it easier to stay fueled and make heart-healthy choices all morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-building-a-better-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Building a Better Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Blood pressure is a complex interaction of various forces,” says Twyman. Of course, there’s nutrition, but timing matters too. “Most people should eat their largest meal of the day in the morning and ideally within one hour of sunrise,” he says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, here’s Twyman’s easy formula for a blood pressure-lowering breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Protein is important for muscle synthesis, so shoot for at least 30 grams of protein at your first meal of the day,” says Twyman. What does muscle have to do with blood pressure? One study showed that greater lean muscle mass is associated with a lower risk of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you really want to build more muscle, you’ll need to add in resistance training. So, be sure to include a couple of strength-training sessions in your weekly exercise routine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe supplies 18 grams of protein. But if you want to hit that 30-gram target, you can add 2 large eggs. You may be thinking, “Wait! Don’t I need to worry about how many eggs I’m eating if I’m trying to be mindful of heart health?” Yes, eggs contain cholesterol (about 200 milligrams per large egg).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;However, “dietary cholesterol does not raise serum cholesterol, so don't worry about the cholesterol content of eggs,” Twyman explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15803/is-saturated-fat-truly-bad-for-your-heart/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;? “Some people are more sensitive to a diet high in saturated fat, so monitor your lipids with routine blood work to see if you are susceptible,” recommends Twyman. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But most of us don’t need to worry. While eggs contain some saturated fat, they have less than you might expect. In fact, one whole large egg only has 1.6 grams of saturated fat, which isn’t much if your overall diet is pretty low in saturated fat, to begin with.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you’re still concerned, you can use egg whites for protein without the saturated fat or opt to add nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-vs-yogurt-which-is-better-for-gut-health-11797224" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt; instead of additional eggs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that complex interaction of forces that impact blood pressure that Twyman mentioned? Blood glucose is one of them. So, avoiding glucose spikes and preventing insulin resistance is key. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s why: Chronically high blood sugar can cause endothelial damage, meaning your blood vessels cannot function properly. And for people living with diabetes, high blood sugar levels make it difficult for the body to produce nitric oxide, an important vasodilator that opens up the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow easily.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, this may lead to elevated blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is eating a breakfast that’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; slows digestion and helps prevent blood glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing fiber with protein balances your breakfast and makes it even more effective. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Dietary Nitrates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Foods high in dietary nitrates, like dark leafy greens and beets, provide the body with compounds that help produce nitric oxide,” says Twyman. Studies show that loss of nitric oxide production is one of the first steps in the development of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Including spinach in your breakfast scramble is an easy way to increase your intake of dietary nitrates. But if spinach isn’t your thing, you can also get plenty of blood pressure–lowering &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959424/what-are-nitrates-are-they-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates&lt;/a&gt; in your diet from arugula, Swiss chard, basil, parsley, radishes, bok choy and beets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use some ideas to add more blood pressure–supporting nutrients to your morning, try these tasty breakfast recipes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8007506/black-beans-rice-fried-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Black Beans, Rice &amp;amp; Fried Egg&lt;/a&gt;. This winning combo of eggs and black beans delivers 19 grams of protein and 11 grams of fiber. Then spinach provides those dietary nitrates that help open your blood vessels for optimal blood flow. Using leftover cooked brown rice is an easy way to get this breakfast on the table fast. Canned beans and prewashed baby spinach are also huge timesavers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7918553/spanakopita-breakfast-sandwiches/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spanakopita Breakfast Sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. A breakfast sandwich is a tasty, convenient way to work nitrate-rich greens into your morning. Here, you’ll get a double shot courtesy of wilted spinach and arugula. This sandwich also provides 15 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7887568/breakfast-salad-with-smoked-salmon-poached-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Breakfast Salad with Smoked Salmon &amp;amp; Poached Eggs&lt;/a&gt;. A big bowl of greens is a fantastic way to work in those nitrates. But the blood pressure benefits of this breakfast don’t stop there. Smoked salmon provides a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669415/signs-you-might-not-be-eating-enough-omega-3s/#:~:text=Victoria%20Seaver%2C%20M.S.%2C%20R.D.%2C,and%20diastolic%20blood%20pressure%20levels." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, another key nutrient for lower blood pressure. This bowl also boasts 15 grams of protein plus 6 grams of fiber. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280185/breakfast-beans-with-microwave-poached-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Breakfast Beans with Microwave-Poached Egg&lt;/a&gt;. In Costa Rica, this popular breakfast bean dish, called gallo pinto, traditionally calls for rice. For extra fiber, we sub in cooked barley. But feel free to use whatever leftover cooked whole grain you have on hand. In addition to 10 grams of fiber, you’ll also score 16 grams of protein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As rich in protein as these meals are, you may have noticed they don’t hit that magical 30-gram number. Not to worry. Round out your meal with a single-serve container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt for an easy 16 grams of additional high-quality protein, plus calcium and potassium, two minerals that also promote healthy blood pressure.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A healthy, balanced breakfast can do great things for your heart health and your blood pressure. For a cardiologist-approved morning meal, aim for a combo of protein, fiber and leafy greens, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269838/spinach-egg-scramble-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble with Raspberries&lt;/a&gt;. Its protein and fiber prevent blood sugar spikes and support metabolic health. Plus, its protein helps maintain lean muscle mass, which may also reduce your risk of high blood pressure. For an extra dose of protection, leafy green spinach delivers blood pressure–lowering nitrates plus additional fiber. Now, that’s what we call a recipe for heart health!

    &lt;p&gt;You might have preconceptions about tofu. In fact, perhaps you religiously avoid it when you’re scanning the supermarket fridges for your meats and cheeses for the week. But it’s “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/tofu-chocolate-mousse-with-blueberries/"&gt;a hero ingredient&lt;/a&gt;”, says Sophie Macfie, a cook, qualified personal trainer, and bestselling author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solid white block of condensed soy milk is nutrient-dense, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/leisure/fitness/best-protein-powders/"&gt;high in protein&lt;/a&gt; and delicious – available in a variety of forms from fried to fermented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be anything you want it to be,” says Sophie. “Some think it’s very one dimensional and can only be used as a meat alternative, but its uses are limitless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie mixes &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/tofu-chocolate-mousse-with-blueberries/"&gt;tofu into desserts&lt;/a&gt;, grates it over salads, and whizzes it into creamy sauces. So, what are the health benefits of tofu – and why should you give it a try in 2026 (even if you’re an avid meat eater)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The nutritional profile of tofu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu is high in protein – in fact, “it’s considered a complete protein as it provides all of the essential amino acids which is uncommon for a plant-based food”, explains Dr Sammie Gill, registered dietitian and BDA media spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) – a plant-based omega-3 – and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-bone-broth/"&gt;low in both total fat&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fat, Dr Sammie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calcium content of tofu depends on the coagulant used during production, she explains. “For instance, using salt coagulants like calcium sulphate results in a higher calcium content in the final product – around 350mg per 100g.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be hard to consume enough calcium and iron, when following a strict plant-based diet, tofu is a good source of both nutrients. A 100g serving of tofu contains roughly 5mg of iron which is over half the daily recommended intake for men and women over 50 and around a third of what women aged 19 to 49 need each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, a 100g serving of plain tofu contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;120 calories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7g fat (1g saturates)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15g protein&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.5g fibre&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu is sold in different forms ranging from super-firm to silken. The firmer the tofu, the less water it contains which means that silken tofu is the softest and smoothest variation. Because it has a higher water content and isn’t pressed, it contains fewer calories and less protein, Dr Sammie notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers report progress toward a pill that lowers blood sugar and boosts fat burning without cutting appetite or weakening muscles. The findings come from a collaboration between &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.su.se/english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stockholm University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug works very differently from popular treatments like Ozempic. Those medications rely on gut and brain signals to reduce hunger and are usually given by injection. While effective, they often bring nausea, stomach issues, appetite loss, and muscle decline. The new approach aims to avoid those problems by targeting how muscles use energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of telling the brain to eat less, the treatment turns on metabolism directly in skeletal muscle. That shift matters because muscle plays a key role in blood sugar control and overall health. Stronger muscle is also linked to longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Discovery of adrenergic receptor agonists that increase glucose uptake with low cAMP generation (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="h-how-the-drug-works-inside-the-body"&gt;How the Drug Works Inside the Body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tablet is built from a lab-developed molecule known as a beta-2 agonist. These molecules are not new, but past versions often overstimulated the heart. That risk limited their use. The research team redesigned the molecule to trigger helpful muscle signals without pushing the heart too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal tests, the treatment improved &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lowering-blood-sugar-may-cut-heart-death-risk-in-half-helping-over-a-billion-prediabetics-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels and body composition. Fat burning increased, while muscle mass stayed intact. Appetite did not drop, and digestive side effects did not appear. Those results stood out because many existing diabetes and weight-loss drugs struggle to protect muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early human testing brought encouraging news as well. In a phase I clinical trial, 48 healthy volunteers and 25 people with type 2 diabetes took the drug. The participants tolerated it well, and no major safety concerns emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results point to a future where we can improve metabolic health without losing muscle mass,” said Tore Bengtsson, a professor at Stockholm University. He explained that muscle health matters deeply in both diabetes and obesity and connects closely to life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Compound 15 binds the orthosteric site on β2AR.

Over time, that raises the risk of serious problems, including heart disease and nerve damage. Many treatments focus on lowering sugar levels but ignore what happens to muscle along the way," Bengtsson told &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new drug flips that focus. By activating metabolism inside muscle cells, it helps the body use sugar more efficiently. Fat burning rises as well, which supports healthier weight loss," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane C. Wright, an assistant professor at Karolinska Institutet, said the drug could change how treatment feels for patients. “This drug represents a completely new type of treatment and has the potential to be of great importance for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity,” he said. He also noted that patients would not need injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="h-a-treatment-that-can-work-alone-or-together"&gt;A Treatment That Can Work Alone or Together&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the drug lies in how it fits with existing therapies. Because it works through muscle instead of appetite control, it can be combined with&lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/glp-1-drugs-like-ozempic-and-wegovy-are-changing-the-foods-americans-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; drugs. The two treatments act on separate pathways, which opens the door to stronger results without piling on side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;mTORC2 links GRK2-biased β2AR agonism to glycemic control.

It also gives doctors more options to tailor care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="h-what-comes-next-in-human-testing"&gt;What Comes Next In Human Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is a larger phase II clinical trial. That study will focus on people with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-a-hidden-connection-between-type-2-diabetes-and-hearing-loss/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or obesity and will test whether the benefits seen in animals and early trials hold up over time. The trial will be run by Atrogi AB, the company developing the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research reflects years of teamwork across institutions in Sweden, Denmark, and Australia.

Here’s what experts say you should know about rucking and how to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rucking adds resistance training to your walk, and has a host of other fitness benefits, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking brings more of a challenge to your daily walk, which is a good thing for someone who is looking to work their body in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physically, walking is awesome, but sometimes we want to amplify that, and the easy way to do that is adding weight,” Cihlar said. “Resistance training is key, especially as we age, in helping our bone health and our muscle growth because that naturally deteriorates as we get older, starting in our 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking takes your walk from a cardio exercise to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cardio plus resistance training. It’s recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="you do 20 minutes of strength training" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;you do 20 minutes of strength training&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research shows that" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; most people do not hit that minimum. Rucking can be one way to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is also good for your cardiovascular endurance, Welch said. Specifically, rucking benefits your “cardiac output, it’s going to help with the efficiency of your heart pumping the blood out,” Welch explained. This can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart rate, so it’s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also good for your posture and back strength. “The ruck is kind of pulling you back, so it really forces you to maintain your posture,” Welch said, who added that it’s a good way to offset the hours and hours and hours of sitting you likely do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Going for a walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack on your back is a good way to add resistance training to your walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus, rucking is good for your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is an exercise you do outdoors, and getting outside in itself is great for your mental health. According to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mental Health America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Mental Health America&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside is linked to lower levels of stress and a better mood overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the body produces vitamin D" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;the body produces vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight, which is important for bone health and can even help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="curb depression and anxiety symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcff6e4b05f1e1aabecf4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;curb depression and anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to always say you never come back from a ruck in a bad mood. It gives you time to clear your head,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are simple ways you can start rucking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting rucking doesn’t have to be complicated. “What’s nice is you can literally start with a backpack you have in your closet and ... throw some magazines in it ... your water bottle,” Cihlar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a rucksack and rucksack weights if you want to use something that is officially made for the sport. Both experts said a rucksack is preferable because it’s safer. A regular backpack can sit pretty low on your back, which can cause issues if you’re carrying around a heavy bag. If you do decide to opt for a backpack, just make sure it isn’t sagging too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much weight you’ll want to carry on your back, that depends on your strength level and your size. “I always say start low because you can always grow from there,” Cihlar said. “You don’t want to start heavy and get discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t a frequent exerciser or weightlifter, starting with just 5 or 10 pounds and building on that is a good idea, she said. As for distance, start with a mile and see how you feel, Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if you’re someone that is regularly active and you lift weights, you could probably do a 20-pound plate, a 30-pound plate in your ruck,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with a mile is a good idea here, too, said Welch, but you can bump it up to a mile and a half or more if you don’t feel challenged. For an additional challenge, take your workout to hilly terrain, Welch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, you can design your own rucking workout regimen to fit your workout goals and fitness level. You can start small with light weights and a short walk, or, if you’re up for it, take a heavier backpack on an incline walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you listen to your body and know your limits, there’s no wrong way to start incorporating this exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPSVQyb0wzVVFyR1RqV1U0bG9Vbm1kb1VldEd4S2NwVXRvNV9SOTFwQlhyY3ZoVExsRTVCM2RrYjBwdjZyMHhQMmVXSzM0Y1d2MkVRRy1JVW5KTDhwMGVmNGswSlNJWW9BZjlxQmhkSFRKaFgyOWc4aEFtWHQ4UTY3elpuT081LXVyTFdud01hYjRGcENFUzQxatIBngFBVV95cUxPMTVXYVp5bi1nY0RwZlZzbk1mT0FxRDBzbk1MYlk0LXdVZWFCS0pfNHQ3UENOaWJLT3dTMVN0SXZoTDlOd0JYX3RYNzhvb0hkU3RsWmFvWkh2R1dOMFc3aHo1dWozRWRtRjFEb2t1QU5yNGphQXduYzAzQ3NqdExjUFhHcURKNGMyNGM1Q1phOWpKRkNmWUtNcnI0NGZydw</guid></item><item><title>如果您因为走上楼梯而被缠住，这意味着什么- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-does-it-mean-if-you-get-tired-walking-stairs-goog_l_695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ascended a flight or two of stairs, you likely know the feeling of being out of breath once you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common occurrence among folks of all ages and fitness abilities. But is it something to worry about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told HuffPost there are a few points to keep in mind when it comes to this phenomenon. While it can be normal, it can also be cause for concern or even a fitness challenge to try and improve.

You’re doing a squat or a lunge when you go up the stairs,” said Erickson, “so, definitely more effortful than just walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how winded you are will vary; you’ll be more out of breath if you run up the stairs or walk up with a heavy suitcase than if you leisurely walked up the stairs. Some folks may not even notice the breathlessness as much as others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve got an elite athlete ― like, I doubt Caitlin Clark gets winded going up a flight of stairs ― but for the average middle-aged person, and, unfortunately, especially here in the United States, we tend to live a little bit more sedentary lifestyle, so it can be very normal to get winded just going up one flight of stairs,” Pohlgeers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s a new change or you’re noticing prolonged breathlessness, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be perfectly normal to feel winded after climbing the stairs, there are a few red flags that may signal a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your breathlessness a new issue that’s never happened before? Or is it getting worse? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, you should talk to a doctor about potential underlying issues, according to Pohlgeers. “The biggest thing is for people not to necessarily think, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m dying,’ but also, don’t always just simply dismiss it as, ‘Well, I’m out of shape.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are things that we really take seriously,” Pohlgeers added. “If there is a change in the exercise capacity, just making sure that we as doctors are able to do our due diligence and rule out any underlying conditions, so that we can maximize people’s lifestyles and help them be as healthy as they possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying conditions such as heart failure, obesity, chronic lung disease, being a smoker, COPD and even being &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog_l_68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anemic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anemic&lt;/a&gt; can all make the breathlessness you feel after &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; up stairs worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long it takes you to recover is always a good indicator, too,” Erickson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for your breathing to be faster for a minute or two after walking up a bunch of stairs, Erickson explained. “But if it’s staying elevated past three minutes or a prolonged period of time, that’s when it becomes more concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice chest pain, headache or vision changes along with the breathlessness, that’s worrisome and worth chatting with your doctor about too, Pohlgeers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you're good. That's a very good sign."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can build your stair-climbing endurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less winded after climbing the stairs, start doing it more often (as long as you don’t have any underlying conditions that can put your health at risk). If you have issues such as heart failure or COPD that make climbing stairs a challenge, get those treated first, Pohlgeers stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body adapts to imposed demands on it. So, if you’re practicing going up the stairs, you become more efficient,” Erickson said. The muscles needed to climb the stairs will strengthen the more you use them, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll ask patients, actually, that are getting ready to go into surgery, it’s like a pre-op clearance: ‘Could you carry groceries up three to four flights of stairs?’” Pohlgeers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s OK if you’re out of breath by the top of the three or four flights of stairs. The concern is can you physically do it without having symptoms like chest pain, vision changes or a headache, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you’re good. That’s a very good sign,” Pohlgeers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing your base strength levels — doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lunges" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="squats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695fcf67e4b07c500938cac1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, that’s going to give you more power, more strength to go up [stairs],” Erickson added. Improving your cardiovascular fitness can also help decrease the fatigue you feel at the top of the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working on building up your endurance, do so gradually, Pohlgeers suggested. You don’t need to go up and down the stairs five times in a row. Instead, slowly build up your fitness ability in a sustainable and even enjoyable way, whether that’s by doing more yard work, going on walks with your neighbor or taking up gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on your strength and cardiovascular fitness, your stair-climbing endurance should also improve, according to Erickson. You’ll be easily climbing back-to-back flights of stairs in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOQ0NUY3dWXy1Kblg2SllVeFpyXzlVcHEwX0NCa05UTzNNV29MVDJYQlh6ZHJHX0hRbVBTZjNJbG4yY3MxWGRPbWIwU3FYMGV1LS02TVp6U2h1Qkx2eEhGOGZzRERReFB2MW1ZNC1oMkltUHBUTGthVTFWdWNfUm82ZUlHd3B1X1dTa19KOFZTWmdZMHAwcm1nbUNsSURCbkVKb1dFOXNndWpNS3dSU2lwd2p30gG3AUFVX3lxTE05eXUwc3BJcnZYUWZRY1JkNHR1ZGM1UlVsVEhZYlB6QkR5QUNYU2xac0tTaUVGNC11UW1kR0JEblBtdGQzWk1jWkNaYkVHbktZRVJLTzhhQVhaZHhkVVdmVTdFaGFUTkt5U0diVXFwNEJQWXR5S3R6c2NEeDA1NHN4V1JkNnFwZC11Zy1xWUk2LWNIYkxxX3pRZUZja0pBQWNaV3lDMGZoYm5IYWgzWnlhR2todG5NTQ</guid></item><item><title>令人惊讶的心脏病发作症状以及如果您有心脏病发作，该怎么办- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/surprising-heart-attack-symptoms/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;With a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/new-study-weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-could-lower-heart-attack-risk/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which is when the blood flow to the heart is blocked and thus limits the body's oxygen supply, the first symptom that likely comes to mind is chest pain. But that isn't the only way a heart attack can manifest. Also known as a myocardial infarction, a heart attack can affect anyone of any age, so it's best to prepare yourself with the knowledge you need to recognize and address this medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Below, we outline the more surprising symptoms associated with a heart attack, along with what you should do if you or someone you know is experiencing one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1cb2cdbf-9df0-48c1-b25f-3ae09a66fd68" data-ng-block="{"&gt; Heart attack symptoms, both common and unexpected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain isn't the only symptom of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;magicmine/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think "heart attack," classic symptoms such as chest discomfort might first come to mind. Heart attacks can present differently in men and women and in people with certain diseases, like diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attack symptoms could include:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-ng-block="{" id&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest discomfort, pain or pressure that radiates up to your jaw, your back and/or your left shoulder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad indigestion or nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extreme fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling generally unwell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially anything from the belly button up," says Dr. Khadijah Breathett, a heart failure transplant cardiologist and tenured associate professor of medicine at Indiana University. "Constant pressure should raise concern that you should see your doctor, and it's OK if it's something else. We'd rather have an individual come see a health care professional and get evaluated rather than toughing it out at home, because that is what contributes to the escalating risk of death."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c33faa9d-361f-42a3-94d3-7e948ee2970f" data-ng-block="{"&gt;What to do during a heart attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is experiencing any of the above symptoms, these are the steps you should follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a3d7146c-2f7d-4869-bd03-fbb53e0870e3" data-ng-block="{"&gt;1. Call 911, no matter what &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel any of the above symptoms, even if you aren't sure it's a heart attack, you should call 911 immediately, doctors recommend.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you feel unwell, or you're starting to have chest discomfort, seek medical attention quickly, because the sooner you get treated, the better," says Dr. Grant Reed, an interventional cardiologist and director of Cleveland Clinic's STEMI program. "A lot of patients ignore their symptoms, and by the time they come in, their heart muscle has already died."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call 911 immediately if you notice any potential heart attack symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Richard T.

There's a strong relationship between when you start to have your heart attack (which is generally when symptoms start) and how fast doctors can open up the blocked coronary artery that's causing it -- the shorter the time, the &lt;a target="_self" data-id="4e82eff0-a8d7-49ae-9096-5846b0bdc320" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16750682/"&gt;better the outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, not just regarding survival but also the likelihood of heart failure or needing to be readmitted to the hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get to the hospital, medical professionals will likely perform an electrocardiogram, which will determine the diagnosis of a heart attack. If it is a heart attack, you'll be taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a coronary angiography will be performed. If you have a blockage in your coronary artery, the doctors will offer treatment with a balloon and a stent to keep the artery open.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are hesitant to seek emergency medical care due to a lack of insurance or immigration status. In the US, hospitals are required to treat all people who come in with life-threatening emergencies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a lot better to be treated and deal with the financial ramifications after the fact," Reed says, adding that, in most cases, the costs can be sorted out with the hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of driving yourself to the hospital, call an ambulance to keep yourself and others safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="34548bba-aafa-4f87-a59a-303d1a35b4e6" data-ng-block="{"&gt;2. Have an ambulance take you to the hospital   &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't drive yourself to the hospital: Call an ambulance. You could lose consciousness and hurt yourself or others on the road, says Dr. Joel Beachey, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The same goes for having a loved one drive you -- if your symptoms worsen, they won't be able to help you while they're driving, and may be distracted.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramedics can provide the best and fastest care while you're on the way to the hospital, including giving you an assessment and providing some treatment, Beachey says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're with someone who is having heart attack symptoms and becomes unconscious, you should first call 911 and then engage in CPR, Breathett says. (You can find free CPR training at your local &lt;a target="_self" data-id="f3f14a6e-afad-4864-b515-89fbb81d888a" href="https://www.heart.org/"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; branch and many other places.)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1dd5fa33-32e9-40db-87ca-6654b5690b20" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Take aspirin, if you have it &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're having heart attack symptoms and have access to aspirin, take a full dose of 325 mg after calling the ambulance, says Beachey. (If you have baby aspirin, which comes in an 81 mg dose, take four of those.) He recommends chewing it instead of swallowing, so it gets into your system faster.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? When you're having a heart attack, a plaque inside your arteries becomes unstable and ruptures, which forms a blood clot that can close off the supply to that artery. Taking aspirin can help break down some of that blood clot.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;ER Productions Limited/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="d6ee91cc-a544-458e-87a6-ebfa304cc304" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4. Advocate for yourself   &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, healthcare providers would take all patient concerns seriously when it comes to heart attack symptoms, but studies show women and people of color are less likely to receive adequate treatment for heart attacks and heart disease. For example, older Black women were 50% less likely to be treated when they arrived at a hospital with a heart attack or coronary artery disease symptoms than white women, including after accounting for education, income, insurance status and other heart health complications like diabetes and high blood pressure, a &lt;a target="_self" data-id="a77d7532-0b90-4fce-982f-40d0d9b0c5c8" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/racial-disparities-continue-for-black-women-seeking-heart-health-care?preview=b3de"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been very clear over most of our history in the US that women and people of color are not heard," Breathett says. "Their symptoms get dismissed, and they have worse outcomes. As a health care system, we have a lot more work to do to change that system so that each person can get equitable care irrespective of their demographic."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that time comes, patients need to be their own advocates and speak up for themselves, she adds. If they aren't being heard, they have the right to seek care elsewhere.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One tip recommended by a resident on TikTok: If you feel a provider isn't taking your symptoms seriously, for heart health or otherwise, you can ask the provider, "What is your differential diagnosis?"   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A differential diagnosis is a term to describe the different diseases that could be contributing to your symptoms. You're basically asking the provider to explain why they've ruled out a heart attack and what else it could be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That might help a person realize, 'Oh, I haven't effectively tested to make sure this is not cardiac disease,'" Breathett says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also bring a family member or friend to help ask questions on your behalf.

			&lt;p&gt;There is no strong evidence that replenishing hormones after menopause is linked to dementia, according to a sweeping  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review is the most rigorous investigation to date of the link between cognitive health and menopause hormone therapy (MHT), also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which seeks to replenish ovarian hormones after the cessation of menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which covers the health data of more than a million women, was commissioned by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), which currently provides no specific guidance on dementia and MHT, despite &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/study-linking-hrt-with-dementia-risk-unhelpful"&gt;recent controversy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-drug-reduces-breast-cancer-growth-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Menopause Drug Reduces Breast Cancer Growth In Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This review will help to inform the upcoming WHO guidelines on reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which are expected to be released in 2026," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/menopause-hormone-therapy-does-not-appear-impact-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; senior author Aimee Spector, a clinical psychologist from University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/hormone-replacement-therapy/"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that when prescribed properly, hormone replacement therapy is safe and very effective at treating symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, poor sleep, low libido, and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of life benefits for the average healthy person &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;generally outweigh&lt;/a&gt; the potential risks of MHT, which can include a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/benefits-and-risks-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;very small increased risk of blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/risk/risk-factors/using-hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;slightly increased chance of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; for those with specific risk factors. But these risk increases still depend on the timing, hormone mix and even delivery method of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-symptoms-may-be-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-study-shows"&gt;menopause is linked to dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and that hormone changes in life &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-goes-through-5-distinct-epochs-massive-study-finds"&gt;are associated with changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, it is not yet clear if MHT helps or hinders cognition as a person ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Menopause hormone therapy is widely used to manage menopausal symptoms, yet its impact on memory, cognition, and dementia risk remains one of the most debated issues in women's health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/menopause-hormone-therapy-does-not-appear-impact-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and aging cognition researcher Melissa Melville from UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones"&gt;Conflicting research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/benefits-and-risks-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about potential harms have fueled public and clinical debate, leaving women and clinicians unsure whether menopause hormone therapy might raise or reduce their risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the current analysis was unable to find any &lt;span&gt;strong evidence that MHT impacts the risk of dementia, either for better or worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most studies were &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/study-linking-hrt-with-dementia-risk-unhelpful"&gt;observational only&lt;/a&gt;, which means they can't prove cause or effect. Their results show inconsistent and slight associations with dementia, some positive and some negative, but all with very low certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these studies, MHT formulations, doses, and prescription timing varied considerably, making comparisons difficult. Women who start MHT formulations after the age of 60, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/when-to-take-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;may face more risks&lt;/a&gt;, and the medication may not be as advisable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/198994"&gt;one randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that estrogen-only MHT products may increase the risk of dementia in women over the age of 65. But the certainty of those results, the authors of the review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, is "low due to serious imprecision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absolute risk difference was 6.27 additional cases per 1000 women, indicating little to no difference in dementia risk when initiated after age 65 years," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt; Melville and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;2024 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; Commission on dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which also found insufficient evidence to suggest MHT increases or decreases the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also align with a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-to-remove-black-box-warnings-from-menopause-hormone-therapy-heres-why"&gt;November announcement&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detailing plans to remove the 'black box' warnings on MHT products, which had previously cautioned about an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this same announcement, the FDA cited &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1996.00440180075009"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested HRT products might actually &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. But this new review suggests that claim is not supported by robust evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dew027"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; also recommend MHT for the prevention of dementia if someone has experienced premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, available evidence to date does not support MHT solely for risk reduction of dementia nor does MHT increase dementia risk," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; Melville and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a need for further high-quality research &lt;span&gt;to clarify the role of MHT in relation to dementia.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review research team specifically calls for further data on those who enter menopause prematurely, either because of a hysterectomy, where the uterus is surgically removed, or an &lt;span&gt;oophorectomy&lt;/span&gt;, where one or both of the ovaries are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-both-ovaries-could-come-at-a-serious-cost-to-the-brain-researchers-find"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that having an &lt;span&gt;oophorectomy&lt;/span&gt; under the age of 50 can come with a serious risk to the brain. A hysterectomy, meanwhile, is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hysterectomy-significantly-raises-risk-of-stroke-new-evidence-suggests"&gt;tied to a higher risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;. There is insufficient data to compare these subgroups as it stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause research is seriously &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00150-y"&gt;underfunded&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some initial studies linked MHT to adverse health outcomes, prescriptions around the globe &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/hhs-advances-womens-health-removes-misleading-fda-warnings-hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;dropped sharply&lt;/a&gt;, despite the serious limitations of these findings and the many caveats that later emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take time and research to build trust in this life-changing therapy once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100803"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Healthy Longevity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Turn on any podcast, and you’re bombarded with 18-step morning routines, expensive “anti-aging” powders, and hacks that promise to rewind your biological clock. It’s enough to make you think that living a long, healthy life requires a PhD and a second mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you strip away the marketing and look at the actual data, the secret to &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/wellness/sleep-longevity/"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; isn’t found in a bottle. It’s found in the produce aisle.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of ‘superfoods’ is largely a misconception used for marketing purposes,” says &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.instagram.com/mkaeberlein/?hl=en"&gt;Dr. Matt Kaeberlein&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist and the CEO of Optispan, a health technology company focused on health span extension. “There is no single food with magical properties. Longevity comes from overall dietary patterns, not nutritional silver bullets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True longevity isn’t achieved with a list of hacks. When paired with other healthy living habits, it comes from mastering the boring, unsexy fundamentals that have kept humans alive for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Boring Truth About What to Eat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love the idea of a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/why-theres-no-such-thing-superfood/"&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt; because it feels like a cheat code—eat this berry, live forever. But some of the most substantial evidence for longevity consistently points to a short list of humble staples, including legumes, whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analyzed over 100,000 adults and found that adhering to a plant-forward diet, specifically one rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, was associated with significantly better aging outcomes. The researchers noted that there wasn’t one “perfect” diet, but rather several patterns (like the Mediterranean or plant-based diets) that all shared the same DNA of minimally processed plants and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want a single litmus test, look at how much of someone’s diet is minimally processed plant food versus ultra-processed calories,” says &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.anantmd.com/"&gt;Dr. Anant Vinjamoori&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Officer at Superpower, a health platform that offers proactive, personalized healthcare. “That split predicts a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do these simple foods work better than high-tech supplements? It’s called the food matrix. “Whole foods deliver a package: fiber, micronutrients, protein, fats, and thousands of bioactive compounds that travel together,” Vinjamoori explains. Supplements can’t replicate that synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Health Fats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a place to start, look at foods like almonds and walnuts. “&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5762129/"&gt;Large cohort studies&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly associate regular nut intake with lower cardiovascular risk and reduced all-cause mortality,” says &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://melaniemurphyrd.com/"&gt;Melanie Murphy Richter&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and longevity expert. Beyond nuts, Richter points to extra-virgin olive oil for its anti-inflammatory properties and plant proteins like beans and lentils, which help keep cellular aging pathways balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even humble fiber, often ignored in favor of flashy nutrients, plays a massive role. Kaeberlein explains that higher fiber intake is consistently linked to better metabolic health and longevity, recommending a target of 30 to 40 grams per day. Vinjamoori agrees, suggesting a simple, actionable goal of adding beans or lentils once a day as a simple move that improves satiety, cardiometabolic risk, and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the boring staples win because they work together. As Richter notes, “One ingredient can support health, but it cannot replace the whole system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your twenties you might have eaten &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/protein-craze-nutritionist-advice/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; to build biceps, but in your fifties and beyond, getting enough can help you stay out of a nursing home. As we age, our bodies develop &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12655298/"&gt;anabolic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, meaning we become less efficient at turning protein into muscle. “The same protein dose produces a weaker muscle-building signal,” says Vinjamoori. This is critical because muscle is a longevity organ; losing it puts you on a fast track to frailty and metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current research, including a 2024 review in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/15/2461"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and data published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10884611/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that the standard recommended allowance (0.36 grams for every pound of body weight) is likely too low for optimal aging. Experts now recommend aiming higher to counteract muscle loss. A reasonable rule of thumb, according to Kaeberlein, is 0.6 to 0.9 grams of protein for every pound, combined with regular resistance training. Vinjamoori explains that while general recommendations for older adults often start lower, needs increase significantly if a person is active, recovering from illness, or trying to rebuild strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source and timing of that protein matter just as much as the total amount. Richter notes that from age 18 to 65, protein from plant sources like legumes and beans appears particularly supportive of long-term health and metabolic balance.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Furthermore, you shouldn’t hoard your daily intake for a massive steak dinner. “Protein quality, distribution across meals, and pairing with resistance training matter as much as total intake,” says Richter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ‘Blue Zone’ Reality Check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard the gospel of the Blue Zones—those mythical regions like Sardinia, Italy, or Okinawa, Japan, where people supposedly forget to die. Families living in these regions have in common lifestyle factors like whole-food/plant-based diets, natural movement, and strong social ties. But before you book a one-way ticket to the Mediterranean, you should know that the data might be a little… dusty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, demographer Saul Newman &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news/2024/sep/ucl-demographers-work-debunking-blue-zone-regions-exceptional-lifespans-wins-ig-nobel-prize"&gt;was awarded&lt;/a&gt; an Ig Nobel Prize for highlighting a correlation between “supercentenarian” hotspots and regions with poor birth record-keeping or high rates of pension fraud. In other words, some of those 110-year-olds might just be clerical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just because the numbers are messy doesn’t mean the habits are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leaving aside ongoing debates about which Blue Zones are real, the consistent themes are clear,” says Kaeberlein. Whether or not everyone is hitting triple digits, the populations in these regions consistently display lower rates of chronic disease, and the mechanism isn’t genetic magic, it’s lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.jgerontology-geriatrics.com/article/view/865"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Gerontology and Geriatrics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Sardinian longevity highlights that the secret is actually a combination of factors, including a plant-forward diet, constant low-level physical activity (like walking and gardening), and strong family bonds. Basically, living in an environment that discourages sitting still and eating processed junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Transferrable Lessons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to live in an Italian village to replicate the biological benefits. The research points to a few specific transferables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat a Plain Diet.&lt;/b&gt; Across these regions, the menu is remarkably consistent. It is high in whole foods, legumes, and whole grains, and low in ultra-processed foods. A &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/22/12013"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of longevity diets found that these patterns &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12929-025-01188-w"&gt;work by&lt;/a&gt; reducing inflammation and improving metabolic health, often mimicking the effects of caloric restriction without the hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t Eat Alone.&lt;/b&gt; In North America, we often view food as fuel to be consumed at a desk. In longevity hotspots, meals are social anchors. “Isolation is not a longevity strategy,” warns Vinjamoori. “Social eating matters.” The &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11872968/"&gt;data supporting this&lt;/a&gt; shows that strong social capital is a primary driver of successful aging in these zones, helping to buffer stress and improve mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize Deliciousness. &lt;/b&gt;Sustainability is key. As Registered Dietitian &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://instagram.com/ashleykoffapproved"&gt;Ashley Koff&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition course director at the University of California, Irvine says, if your longevity diet tastes like cardboard, you won’t stick to it long enough to see your great-grandkids. “One of the core pillars of longevity eating is ‘better be delicious to me,’” says Koff. The Mediterranean diet works largely because it is enjoyable—rich in fats like olive oil and diverse flavors—making it a pattern people want to maintain for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lesson isn’t to copy a specific cuisine,” Kaeberlein says “but to apply those principles within your own cultural context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About Fasting and Supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re hoping a pill or a fasting window will help you retain a heavier lifestyle, the experts say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fasting and time-restricted eating&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are not inherently longevity-promoting,” states Kaeberlein. While they can be useful tools to stop you from snacking on junk at midnight, they don’t replace food quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, “They’re best for correcting a deficiency&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;or treating a defined risk factor,” Vinjamoori says. Unless you have a specific medical need, your money is likely better spent on high-quality groceries. The exceptions worth discussing with your doctor are Omega-3s, Vitamin D, and creatine, which Kaeberlein calls “one of the most evidence-supported supplements” for maintaining muscle and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Long Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longevity isn’t a six-week challenge or a guru-promoted biohacking stack. It’s a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I genuinely prefer a salmon salad to a cheeseburger and fries,” Kaeberlein admits, noting that taste buds adapt over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best diet for longevity is simply the one you can stick to for the next 50 years. So, start small. Swap a processed snack for an apple. Add a scoop of lentils to your soup. “Do it consistently, then build from there,” Vinjamoori advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t just to live longer. It’s to live better—and that starts with what’s on your plate today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Outside Magazine</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:14:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9wT09ZMDlldkhpR01rblk0RmhpSXhYWlVqaDJkellfUWo0UkxPaWZPcTNXTk45NjdzOVF4N0dCMmhpYVdlMGJKZjVyMUI1bnZ1dGRqc0Y5TExhX1N3NFA3SU5XOFhXTmt6eEFEeW5qZVg0ZnNRUXc</guid></item><item><title>对抗椰子犀牛甲虫的病毒显示出有希望的结果- Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://www.staradvertiser.com/2026/01/11/hawaii-news/virus-to-fight-coconut-rhinoceros-beetle-shows-promising-results/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hsa-paywall-content" class="hsa-paywall"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;Every other day inside a lab on the third floor of the St. John Plant Science Laboratory building on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, doctoral student Kristen Gaines opens up a refrigerator full of beetle larvae, hoping to find them dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I see a dead one, it’s still pretty gratifying,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines is a research assistant investigating a virus to kill the coconut rhinoceros beetle, also referred to as CRB, which is decimating Oahu’s coconut and palm trees. After years of trying to eradicate the beetle, the problem has grown to a full infestation, with thousands of trees dead because of the pest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus Gaines is testing is a variant of the oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, referred to as OrNV, which was discovered in the 1960s by German scientist Dr. Alois Huger, according to a 2022 report by researchers from New Zealand and Samoa. The virus, which Huger isolated after he killed healthy beetles by feeding them ones that had died of the virus, was the first time Samoa was able to successfully manage the pest after its introduction in 1910 from a Sri Lanka cargo vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from her testing are promising, Gaines said. She’s observed larvae die after contracting the virus both by injection and naturally from deceased larvae. Most recently, she said, three out of four larvae died after she placed them inside a bin with a dead infected specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of testing facilities &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div id="breaking-news-signup-form" class="email-form rounded my-3 px-4 py-3"&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several East Asian and Pacific island nations have used the virus or variations of it to manage CRB for decades. While there is plenty of research that confirms the virus’ efficacy against the pest, there has been little research on how the virus may affect native beetles, such as the Kauai stag beetle, according to UH principal researcher Michael Melzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other island chains that used the virus against CRB had economies more dependent on palm oil where the potential benefits of releasing the virus outweigh the risks or did not have native insects to worry about, Melzer said. The virus is host-specific, meaning it doesn’t mutate to infect other types of creatures, so the main concern is its effect on native beetles and similar insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the beetle arriving in Hawaii in 2013, the state did not receive a permit to test the virus until April due to the lack of facilities where the tests could be safely administered and contained, said Jonathan Ho, plant quarantine branch manager for the state Department of Agriculture and Biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the CRB invasion on Oahu reached the point where it was “all over the place,” and it wasn’t feasible to spray or inject every coconut tree on the island and properly dispose of all the green waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At that point, at the landscape level, biocontrol was the only real realistic solution to mitigate the threat of CRB,” Ho said. “We weren’t going to spray or treat our way out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that despite its efficacy elsewhere in the Pacific, adequate testing is crucial to protect Hawaii’s environment and ensure the right virus strain is being utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melzer said federal funding the state received to respond to the CRB threat changed from an eradication focus to containment around 2020, ultimately leading to the development of the containment lab and procedures in order to score a federal permit to import the virus and begin testing on larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A near ‘eureka’ moment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry to the colony lab, where Tomie Vowell, a member of the research support team, rears beetles for experiments on request, is a secure, pitch-black room that serves as a bridge between the lab and the hallway. If a beetle were to escape — one never has, according to Melzer — it would get confused in the darkness. A single light in the corner would be turned on to attract the beetle so it could be recaptured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We basically just don’t want that virus leaving the lab, because we don’t know what impact it might have on both native or beneficial insects in Hawaii,” Melzer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the dark room is a door that leads to the lab, where there are four locked refrigerators with beetles at different life stages in various labeled containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRB eggs resemble small white balls. Once hatched, the tiny, pale grubs grow up to 2-1/2-inches long with a strong, black exoskeleton adorned with a rhinoceros-­like horn and fuzzy underbelly. Their natural life cycle from grub to adult is typically a year, Vowell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melzer traveled to Palau to get the virus strain the island nation had used successfully to combat the beetle, and brought it back to Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate lab, Gaines dresses in full protective gear before injecting the virus into CRB larvae. The infected larvae become lethargic as their gut becomes inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines said the first time she suspected a larva exhibiting symptoms had died of the virus, it was “not quite a eureka moment, but close to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can take two to four weeks for larvae to succumb to the virus, Melzer said, while infected adults live longer but ultimately become too lethargic to eat and starve to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the virus is effective because the beetles live long enough to spread the infection to others but in the end die themselves within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It’s already too late’ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes to plan, Melzer estimates the virus could possibly be released into the wild within two years. Ho said the timeline is dependent on state and federal regulatory processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some landscapers, the window for effective CRB containment has long closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It just sucks because there’s a lot that could be done,” said Brent White, owner of Lush Palm Landscapes. “Maybe you should just let that thing (the virus) go out now and kill the beetles. It’s already too late. The North Shore is already gone. All the trees on the North Shore are going to be cut down pretty soon, they’re all going to be gone. There’s no saving it now — sorry, too late — which is really sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White said he’s turned to treating his palm trees nightly with essential oils, which has helped keep his trees alive, but takes a lot of labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s still so hard,” he said. “The minute you stop treating, the beetles come back and attack the tree. It’s just really sad that it’s growing out of control and there wasn’t proper mitigation methods in the beginning to stop it from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance Correa, owner of Malama Aina Landscape and Masonry Design, and Daniel Anthony, founder of nonprofits Hui Aloha ‘Aina Momona and Aloha Organic, agree. The two employ Korean organic farming techniques to combat the beetle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In two to four years, we could lose every coconut tree,” Correa said. “There might not be coconuts to farm. It’s that bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aloha Organic uses a sulfur mixture to deter the beetle, Anthony said, along with nutrients to feed the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We noticed that the healthier your tree was, the more resilient it was to the beetle,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, Anthony’s methods have worked. During a visit Thursday, the residential property he’s been treating monthly in Kaaawa had plenty of coconuts in its trees, while a next-door neighbor’s trees showed evidence of beetle damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both Correa and Anthony, coconuts are part of their culture that helped their ancestors survive for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s life or death for us, for our culture, for our community,” Anthony said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two also share concerns about the long-term effects of chemical use on the trees and the fruit they produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More testing planned &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing recommendations from the &lt;a href="https://www.crbhawaii.org/treatments-palms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Department of Agriculture and Biosecurit&lt;/a&gt;y to combat CRB include chemicals, organic options such as fungi and physical barriers such as netting. Ho said that while he has not heard of sulfur successfully deterring the beetle and it hasn’t been formally studied, any organic option that can be replicated would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basal oil is another organic option to repel beetles, according to the &lt;a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/biocontrol-and-chemicals-for-crb-control/#:~:text=Nudiviruses%20are%20an%20important%20family,last%20up%20to%203%20months." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho said the process for a pesticide to get approval for use against CRB does not necessarily require the same type of rigorous testing on its effects on native species that a bio-agent such as the virus does. But, he explained, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state have labeling processes for use as a pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the chemicals listed on the agriculture department’s website are labeled as being usable and then tested by either UH or a survey response to test efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than treating palm trees, Ho said the best way to manage CRB until a successful bio-agent is approved is to manage green waste and prevent breeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Melzer and Gaines plan to begin testing the virus against native species and potentially bring in a different strain from another affected area to build a virus “library.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melzer said he also hopes to get a permit to test on adult beetles, which so far has not been approved due to the risk of the winged insects escaping by flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We rear CRB for research purposes and we’ve never lost an adult out of there,” he said. “We’re hoping to convince them that we’re never going to lose an adult over here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a permit is not obtained, Melzer said, UH will have to look at better bio-containment facilities so it can finish the testing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone recognizes how important it is that we have these facilities, not even just for CRB, but for other things in the future,” he said. “CRB will not be the last impactful invasive species in Hawaii.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Flu cases continue to rise in western Maine, causing more emergency room and acute care visits as doctors stretch to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/11/25/california-nonprofit-can-acquire-central-maine-healthcare-in-lewiston-state-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Central Maine Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, which owns Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston as well as a variety of care facilities and physician practices, said Friday that the system is experiencing more hospital admissions and emergency and outpatient visits amid &lt;a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/24/flu-cases-spiking-in-maine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the season’s earlier-than-usual surge&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say the region’s most common strain, Influenza A, H3N2, is typically more contagious and severe than other strains.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;Statewide, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2553.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2553.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;8% of doctor’s office visits&lt;/a&gt; last week were for influenza-like symptoms, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This time last year, it was &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2501.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/MaineILIweek2501.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;less than 4%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine’s doctors are experiencing the increased demand through appointment waitlists, call delays and staffing shortages, said Michael Stadnicki, a doctor at Central Maine Family Medicine in Lewiston.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone that works in health care also has the ability to get sick,” Stadnicki said. “There’s more people on the team that are out, so less hands to answer phones, less people to get patients in rooms and be seen, and providers that may succumb to this as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Androscoggin County had 102 positive cases and 17 flu-related hospitalizations last week — the fourth highest in the state. York County had the most positive cases at 246, and Kennebec County had 82 cases but only one hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 10 deaths statewide from flu this season, including three in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike COVID-19, experts say the flu comes on abruptly. A patient might feel fine one hour and be overcome with exhaustion and chills the next, making it easier for the virus to spread undetected in the day before symptoms start and the days after they end. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s typical to see an increase in the flu after the holidays, but this year’s spike began in the middle of December, causing “missed school time and holiday plan interruptions for our pediatric patients,” said Lara Walsh, medical director of MaineGeneral Pediatrics in Augusta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While younger residents ages 5 to 24 are reporting the most positive cases, those 65 and older have had the most hospitalizations due to flu. Three long-term care facilities in Androscoggin County have reported outbreaks this season, and Stadnicki said that number could rise into February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu seems to be more intense for people this year, especially for folks that have underlying vulnerabilities like heart disease or COPD, or are taking some medications that might suppress their immune system,” said Amy Madden, medical director for HealthReach, which operates community health clinics across central Maine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not a great time,” she added. “Get your flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s vaccine protects against three main seasonal flu viruses. While there’s a slight mismatch in the vaccine due to viral mutation, experts say it still offers strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, vaccine fatigue and hesitancy are on the rise nationwide. Coupled with less exposure to common colds during the pandemic, Stadnicki says it’s become more difficult for people to naturally fight the flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “I think this really is one of those culmination of perfect storms: ‘I haven’t had natural colds and flu in a handful of years,’ maybe someone’s skipping the vaccine this year or last year or both, and now we’re starting to finally mix more and more,” he said. “So you’re definitely getting hit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Express care facilities in central and western Maine report high numbers of patients with flu or flu-like symptoms. Jason Brown, senior medical director of MaineGeneral Primary Care, said staff is working to meet increased demand for same-day visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madden said HealthReach clinics are seeing more patients with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and those who say they have been sick at home for a week and are “just not getting better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients who already have the flu are advised to rest, hydrate, stay home and speak to their primary care doctor about medication to treat symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But prevention is the best tool to fight the flu, experts say. People should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their faces and support their immune systems through adequate sleep, exercise and a balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to miss living your life,” Stadnicki said. “So whether it’s a vacation, a get-together, a night out, anything that anyone’s looking forward to — if you don’t do the right things to mitigate your risk, you might miss something that you actually want to do because you don’t feel well enough to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

As cases rise, a newly released study offers surprising insight into how influenza spreads and how people may better protect themselves from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how flu moves from person to person, researchers from the University of Maryland Schools of Public Health and Engineering in College Park and the School of Medicine in Baltimore designed an unusual experiment. College students who were already infected with influenza were placed in a hotel room with healthy middle-aged adult volunteers. Despite close contact, none of the healthy participants became infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this time of year, it seems like everyone is catching the flu virus. And yet our study showed no transmission -- what does this say about how flu spreads and how to stop outbreaks?" said Dr. Donald Milton, professor at SPH's Department of Global, Environmental and Occupational Health and a global infectious disease aerobiology expert who was among the first to identify how to stop the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the Flu Did Not Spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published on January 7 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;, represents the first controlled clinical trial to closely examine airborne flu transmission between people who were naturally infected, rather than intentionally infected in a laboratory, and people who were not infected. Milton and his colleague Dr. Jianyu Lai explored several reasons why none of the volunteers became ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data suggests key things that increase the likelihood of flu transmission -- coughing is a major one," said Dr. Jianyu Lai, post-doctoral research scientist, who led data analysis and report writing for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the infected students carried high levels of virus in their noses, Lai explained that they rarely coughed. As a result, only small amounts of virus were released into the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventilation also played a key role. "The other important factor is ventilation and air movement. The air in our study room was continually mixed rapidly by a heater and dehumidifier and so the small amounts of virus in the air were diluted," Lai said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age may have been another protective factor. According to Lai, middle-aged adults tend to be less vulnerable to influenza than younger adults, which likely contributed to the absence of infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What This Means for Flu Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists believe that airborne transmission is a major driver of flu spread. However, Milton emphasized that changes to global infection-control guidelines require strong evidence from randomized clinical trials like this one. The research team is continuing its work to better understand how flu spreads through inhalation and under what conditions that transmission is most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of transmission observed in this study provides valuable clues about how people can reduce their risk during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being up close, face-to-face with other people indoors where the air isn't moving much seems to be the most risky thing -- and it's something we all tend to do a lot. Our results suggest that portable air purifiers that stir up the air as well as clean it could be a big help. But if you are really close and someone is coughing, the best way to stay safe is to wear a mask, especially the N95," said Milton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the Flu Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research took place on a quarantined floor of a Baltimore-area hotel and included five participants with confirmed influenza symptoms and 11 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted across two groups during 2023 and 2024. A similar quarantine design had been used in earlier research, along with specialized testing of exhaled breath developed by Milton and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants lived on the isolated hotel floor for two weeks and followed daily routines designed to mimic real-life social interactions. These included casual conversations and physical activities such as yoga, stretching, and dancing. Infected participants also handled shared items like a pen, tablet computer, and microphone, which were then passed around the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers closely tracked symptoms and collected daily nasal swabs, saliva samples, and blood samples to monitor infection and antibody development. They measured viral exposure both in the air participants breathed and in the room itself. Exhaled breath samples were collected daily using the Gesundheit II machine, invented by Milton and colleagues at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Flu Research Still Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding better ways to limit flu outbreaks remains a major public health priority, according to Milton. Influenza continues to place a heavy burden on health systems worldwide. Each year, up to 1 billion people globally become infected with seasonal flu. In the United States alone this season, there have already been at least 7.5 million cases, leading to 81,000 hospitalizations and more than 3,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included contributions from researchers at UMD's interdisciplinary Public Health Aerobiology Lab, including Kristen Coleman, Yi Esparza, Filbert Hong, Isabel Sierra Maldonado, Kathleen McPhaul and S.H. Sheldon Tai, as well as collaborators from the UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research came from the NIAID Cooperative agreement U19 grant (5U19AI162130), the University of Maryland Baltimore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower), and gifts from The Flu Lab and Balvi Filantropic Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
