The cloudy area in her upper left chest lobe is from an oleothorax, a now obsolete procedure in which doctors would inject mineral oil into the space between the lungs to treat tuberculosis (TB) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/EM_RESUS/status/1977848357096747164"&gt;video posted on X&lt;/a&gt; this week reacting to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1609176?query=featured_home"&gt;resurfaced case report&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally published in 2017, Dr Sam Ghali, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Florida Health in Jacksonville who was not involved in the case, said: 'This is an absolutely wild chest x-ray that you just don't see every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you think about this in 2025, it sounds absolutely crazy, but you have to imagine back then they didn't have anything else.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, TB infects a few thousands Americans every year and kills about 500, far fewer than cancer, heart disease and dementia. The threat is much more prevalent in developing countries, however, and TB kills 1.2million people worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB in the US was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are now on the rise in 80 percent of US states, which experts have blamed missed cases and distrust of doctors forged by the Covid pandemic.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB have also shifted, starting in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above are public health posters from the Work Projects Administration in the 1930s and '40s on getting tested for tuberculosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of antibiotics, patients receiving an oleothorax would typically have the oil removed after they recovered from TB, though some patients, like the woman in the case report, lived with it for decades.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghali said: 'The routine was that you would come back after a couple of years and get this removed, but a lot of patients, including our patient here, would just get lost to follow-up because they would never go back.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries typically recommended fresh air and rest to alleviate symptoms, typically in sanatoriums established specifically for TB patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 1900s, Adirondack chairs were evented with wide armrests, tall slatted backs and higher seats in the front for patients in TB sanatoriums, as they were thought to help hold up patients' chests and help them get more fresh air, but they did not produce clinical benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB spreads through airborne droplets that are released into the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes or speaks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain. Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US - except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman in the case report had no complications from the oleothorax or TB.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghali said: 'The human body is so amazing that she has adapted and lived with this for like 60 or 70 years, and this was just an incidental finding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just such a powerful testament to the fact that medicine is hard... you've got to do the best with what you have to help people, and it's just so amazing how far we've come in medicine in just 75 years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"This suggests that older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Seniors are more vulnerable to overdoses, as many live with chronic health conditions, take several medications and process drugs more slowly, the researchers said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers could not determine the underlying reasons for these overdoses, as the analysis was a cross-sectional study on patterns over time, Pasia noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths — not due to fentanyl alone — and the importance of sharing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug misuse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drug misuse&lt;/a&gt; prevention strategies to older patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors advised anesthesiologists and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain medicine&lt;/a&gt; specialists to recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, and to be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults over 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, added that older adults prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should be informed about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Doctors are encouraged to be cautious when prescribing opioids to senior patients.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk can also be reduced by simplifying medication routines, and using clear labeling and safe storage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt; methods when appropriate," Wang said in the press release. "Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Larissa K. Laskowski, an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emergency medicine&lt;/a&gt; physician and medical toxicologist at NYU Langone Health, told Fox News Digital that the findings of this study are "not surprising," since illicit-made fentanyl is "one of the deadliest substances known to man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In recent years, it has proliferated throughout the illegal drug market," said Laskowski, who was not involved in the study. "Fentanyl is regularly found in supplies of cocaine and methamphetamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laskowski, an educator in fentanyl risk at schools, stressed that everyone, not just seniors, should be aware of the drug's potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a small amount (the equivalent of a few grains of salt) can stop breathing and cause overdose death," she warned. "Any substance that is sold illegally (not from a dispensary, pharmacy or licensed retail store) could have anything in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no quality control.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding waist size to BMI raises U.S. obesity rates from 42.9% to 68.6%, according to a major JAMA Network Open study.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One in four adults have “hidden” belly-fat obesity despite a normal BMI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Older adults and Asian participants saw the biggest increase in obesity classification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The new definition could change who qualifies for treatment and reshape healthcare policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; A revolutionary change in how doctors define obesity could fundamentally reshape medical practice, according to research analyzing health data from over 300,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that adopting a new obesity framework endorsed by 76 professional medical organizations increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity rates&lt;/a&gt; from 42.9% to 68.6% among study participants. This dramatic jump stems from including people who have dangerous &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-belly-fat-prostate-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; despite maintaining what doctors previously considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-025-01542-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed data from the All of Us research program and represents the first large-scale examination of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-redefined-why-doctors-are-ditching-bmi-for-these-key-health-markers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new obesity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; would affect healthcare. The research tracked participants for four years to document real health outcomes, not just theoretical classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-scale-why-waist-size-matters"&gt;Beyond the Scale: Why Waist Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;height-to-weight calculation&lt;/a&gt; that has dominated medicine for decades, the new approach incorporates waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio alongside BMI to create a more complete health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by endocrinologist Dr. Lindsay Fourman from Massachusetts General Hospital, found that traditional BMI measurements miss many people with dangerous fat distribution patterns. The research team found that belly fat, regardless of overall weight, serves as a key predictor of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercising-belly-fat-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists identified a category called “anthropometric-only obesity” affecting 78,047 study participants. These individuals maintain normal BMI scores while carrying elevated measurements around their midsection. Among this group, 17,426 people (22.3%) had BMI scores doctors previously labeled as normal or underweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;BMI measurements don’t tell the whole story for some people who have higher levels of dangerous belly fat.(kwanchai.c/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-that-bmi-misses"&gt;Health Risks That BMI Misses&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked participants to document who developed serious health problems. People with this hidden form of obesity faced significantly higher risks than those without obesity, despite looking healthy on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared to people without obesity, those with the waist-centered type were 76% more likely to have organ problems. They also faced more than double the risk of developing diabetes and 55% higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;he research team found that people with this form of obesity often developed &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, physical limitations, and sleep apnea. These conditions typically emerge gradually, making early identification through waist measurements potentially valuable for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-age-and-demographics-drive-changes"&gt;Age and Demographics Drive Changes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed striking patterns across different groups. Among participants aged 18 to 29, obesity prevalence under the new definition reached 43.9%. The most dramatic change occurred among seniors: 78.3% of Americans over 70 in the study met criteria for obesity under the new framework, compared to previous BMI-based classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This age-related increase reflects how body composition changes over time, with fat increasingly accumulating &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/bigger-belly-weaker-memory-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around the midsection&lt;/a&gt; as people get older. Among people over 70 in the study, 54.4% had what researchers called “clinical obesity” indicating the presence of organ dysfunction or physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also found notable differences by race and gender. Asian participants saw the largest relative increase in obesity rates, jumping 90.3% from 2,439 participants (27.0%) to 4,641 participants (51.4%) under the new definition. Male participants were more likely than female participants to have anthropometric-only obesity, affecting 32.5% of men versus 21.7% of women in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obesity-treatment-guidelines-face-major-overhaul"&gt;Obesity Treatment Guidelines Face Major Overhaul&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new framework could dramatically alter who receives obesity medications and treatments. Currently, 44.7% of study participants qualified for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ozempic-anti-obesity-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; based on BMI guidelines. Under the new framework, about half of those who currently qualify for weight-loss medication (51.2%) would be reclassified as having preclinical obesity or no obesity, suggesting they may receive lower priority for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, among participants with clinical obesity under the new definition (excluding those with diabetes already eligible for certain medications), 15,495 of 69,894 (22.2%) wouldn’t meet current eligibility criteria for recent weight-loss drug trials or FDA-approved medications. This mismatch indicates treatment guidelines may need substantial revision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Lancet Commission that developed the new definition recommends pharmacological treatment for all people with clinical obesity and select individuals with preclinical obesity. This represents a shift from current practice toward more targeted treatment based on health complications rather than BMI alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-vs-preclinical-obesity"&gt;Clinical vs. Preclinical Obesity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach introduces two categories. “Clinical obesity” means someone has health problems or physical limitations related to their weight. “Preclinical obesity” means early warning signs are present but serious symptoms haven’t developed yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 36% of all study participants had clinical obesity, with rates climbing sharply with age. The distinction matters because people with clinical obesity faced the highest risks of future diabetes, heart disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the earlier stage carried meaningful health risks. People with preclinical obesity had more than three times the risk of developing diabetes and 40% higher risk of heart problems compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study tracked the most common health problems associated with clinical obesity: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; topped the list, followed by physical limitations and sleep apnea. The research revealed that organ dysfunction itself, even without obesity, significantly increased health risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For healthcare systems and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/when-health-insurance-makes-medicine-more-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, these changes could carry massive financial consequences. Medicare and other payers may need to reassess coverage policies as the eligible population for obesity treatments potentially shifts substantially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding,” Dr. Fourman said in a statement. “With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledge that implementing the new definition would require more work and resources than current BMI-based screening. However, they argue that the improved ability to identify health risks may justify the additional effort, particularly if integrated into electronic health record systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity prevalence&lt;/a&gt; using traditional BMI-based criteria (42.9%) closely aligns with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates for the US population (40.3%), supporting the potential broader applicability of these findings to American adults generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 301,026 adults in the All of Us research program, enrolled between May 2017 and September 2023. Participants underwent standardized measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference, and completed health surveys. The study used electronic health records to track health outcomes over a median follow-up period of 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the new obesity definition, 68.6% of participants met criteria for obesity compared to 42.9% using traditional BMI-based criteria. The increase was driven by including 78,047 people with “anthropometric-only obesity” who had elevated waist measurements despite normal BMI. Clinical obesity affected 36.1% of all participants. People with anthropometric-only obesity had odds ratios of 1.76 for organ dysfunction and adjusted hazard ratios of 2.12 for diabetes and 1.55 for cardiovascular events compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on diagnostic codes, surveys, and laboratory results to classify clinical obesity, which may not fully capture all cases of organ dysfunction. Researchers could not establish whether organ dysfunction was directly caused by obesity. The analysis used the new framework’s ability to predict future health risks as a measure of clinical utility, rather than a gold standard comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

"This suggests that older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seniors are more vulnerable to overdoses, as many live with chronic health conditions, take several medications and process drugs more slowly, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers could not determine the underlying reasons for these overdoses, as the analysis was a cross-sectional study on patterns over time, Pasia noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths — not due to fentanyl alone — and the importance of sharing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug misuse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drug misuse&lt;/a&gt; prevention strategies to older patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study authors advised anesthesiologists and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pain medicine&lt;/a&gt; specialists to recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, and to be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults over 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study co-author Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, added that older adults prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should be informed about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are encouraged to be cautious when prescribing opioids to senior patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Risk can also be reduced by simplifying medication routines, and using clear labeling and safe storage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt; methods when appropriate," Wang said in the press release. "Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Larissa K. Laskowski, an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;emergency medicine&lt;/a&gt; physician and medical toxicologist at NYU Langone Health, told Fox News Digital that the findings of this study are "not surprising," since illicit-made fentanyl is "one of the deadliest substances known to man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In recent years, it has proliferated throughout the illegal drug market," said Laskowski, who was not involved in the study. "Fentanyl is regularly found in supplies of cocaine and methamphetamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laskowski, an educator in fentanyl risk at schools, stressed that everyone, not just seniors, should be aware of the drug's potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Just a small amount (the equivalent of a few grains of salt) can stop breathing and cause overdose death," she warned. "Any substance that is sold illegally (not from a dispensary, pharmacy or licensed retail store) could have anything in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There is no quality control. Many drugs today are laced with fentanyl."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The expert reiterated that doctors should speak with patients and caregivers about reversal agents, like over-the-counter Narcan, which is often available for free at &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health departments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health departments&lt;/a&gt;, clinics and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-drug-mix-drives-staggering-rise-overdose-deaths-among-seniors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deadly drug mix drives staggering rise in overdose deaths among seniors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Deadly drug mix drives staggering rise in overdose deaths among seniors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 11:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOU2xXMkcwbXdxZjZRd084SkZ6cElSQXRrekFmekJDU29QY2k3UGFlbFgwOUZyOUg5S2pVcjJjVFU4YTlQZ2Z0S24yRTZTZHZnNVRCNWItWGFhS0kzallmcGhHdnh4aThtaGlOMjFuazMxVWtoUk9fSXRHTVRLc1h1MzFkSk5yMHJnOFp0Zg</guid></item><item><title>这种激素状况影响着数百万女性，但往往被误诊--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/17/pcos-misdiagnosis-treatment-symptoms/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVLRGIHHCNEPVNKVW73JFZO4AM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scrolling through Instagram on her lunch break, Alexis King came across video of model and actress Lori Harvey talking about how long it took for doctors to finally diagnose her with what turned out to be one of the most common hormone conditions among women of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPZFJMUHNRNklUa3h5X3ZOYzdNYnloZlU2eG1FMnRjdUFLTjA2ODJIdXhmZDhXRXU3dkZSdlRjMjloUFhXa09jVlZMVFJZNm1FNnRGSGJpRHhrVTB2UW5oV3g4R05VMGFKNlIySU5lQk56WGtpSllXTGhQQU0wOExzZmRDdFlIOEhtMENGRVNkZw</guid></item><item><title>与对镜像生命末日风险敲响警钟的科学家见面- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/science/mirror-cell-life-dangers</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtk4u0t000x26p9e9ia5bwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientist Kate Adamala doesn’t remember exactly when she realized her lab at the University of Minnesota was working on something potentially dangerous — so dangerous in fact that some researchers think it could pose an existential&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;risk to all life forms on Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000c356n21wv5ghk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was one of four researchers awarded a $4 million &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/researchers-handed-4m-to-boot-up-mirror-cell-synthesis" target="_blank"&gt;US National Science Foundation grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to investigate whether it’s possible to produce a mirror cell,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which the structure of all of its component biomolecules is the reverse of what’s found in normal cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000d356nya8h88qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The work was important, they thought, because such reversed cells, which have never existed in nature, could shed light on the origins of life and make it easier to create molecules with therapeutic value, potentially tackling significant medical challenges such as &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mirror-life/mirror-life" target="_blank"&gt;infectious disease and superbugs&lt;/a&gt;. But doubt crept in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000e356nhvcgdb8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was never one light bulb moment. It was kind of a slow boiling over a few months,” Adamala, a synthetic biologist, said. People started asking questions, she added, “and we thought we can answer them, and then we realized we cannot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000f356nbo7jwacm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The questions hinged on what would happen if scientists succeeded in making a “mirror organism” such as a bacterium from molecules that are the mirror images of their natural forms. Could it inadvertently spread unchecked in the body or an environment, posing grave risks to human health and dire consequences for the planet? Or would it merely fizzle out and harmlessly disappear without a trace?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000g356nxvs08qvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In nature, the structure of many major biomolecules is right- or left-handed, although it’s not clear why life evolved this way. It’s a property known as chirality that was first discovered by French scientist Louis Pasteur in 1848. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For example, DNA and RNA are made from “right-handed” nucleotides, and proteins are made from “left-handed” amino acids. Just as a right-handed glove cannot fit a left hand or how a key precisely fits a lock, interactions between molecules often depend on chirality, and living systems need consistent patterns of chirality to function properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000h356nv1vn418c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mirror cell, all its molecules would be replaced with mirror-image versions.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Such a development is hypothetical; even creating a synthetic cell with natural chirality that mimics its normal living counterparts  isn’t yet possible, but it’s an active and exciting area of research that Adamala and several other research groups are pursuing. Scientists can make many of the components from non-living precursors, and they could soon engineer normal synthetic cells, which in theory could then create single-cell life forms, such as bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtk500o0000356nv1hkh90r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By themselves, small mirror molecules do not pose any particular risks, and scientists can already safely make proteins and carbohydrates with opposite chirality, which hold pharmaceutical promise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000o356n5hsjj4jh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Complete mirror cells, however, remain out of reach. Adamala and her colleagues didn’t make much progress with their investigations on that front. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that the research was slow to get off the ground and, more crucially, informal conversations Adamala had with colleagues in other fields, at conferences and other forums, began to sow alarm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000p356nn8lbj9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People that are experts in biosafety, immunology and ecology, they didn’t think that something like a mirror cell was actually likely, they thought it science fiction,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000q356n0jwj7uv4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One thing these other scientists brought up that was extremely surprising to her was that “mirror cells would likely be completely invisible to the human immune system,” Adamala added. “I used to think the immune system will find a way to detect any invading biomolecules. I didn’t know how chiral the immune system was.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000r356nzm8d5d2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the course of 2023 and 2024, those ad-hoc conversations coalesced into a working group of 38 scientists, including Adamala, and in December 2024 the group published a bombshell article in the high-profile scientific journal Science titled &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2024/12/16/science/mirror-bacteria-research-risks"&gt;“Confronting Risks of Mirror Life,”&lt;/a&gt; which summarized the findings of a detailed 300-page report compiled by the same group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000s356nmuerskem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/cv716pj4036" target="_blank"&gt;The report concluded&lt;/a&gt; that mirror cells could become a reality in the next 10 to 30 years and detailed the potentially devasting consequences if mirror bacteria were released into an environment and spread, evading natural biological controls and acting as dangerous pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000t356nhenaxd1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since then, a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund&lt;/a&gt; has sponsored a series of meetings to develop recommendations aimed at averting the threat scientists think mirror life could pose. While there’s broad agreement that mirror organisms such as bacteria should not be created, there’s much debate over what — if any — limits to investigating mirror biology should exist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg20x000m356nszuj65ge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of experts met at a two-day conference on engineering and safeguarding synthetic life in Manchester, UK, in September to discuss where red lines should be drawn to restrict research into technologies that could enable the creation of mirror organisms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs000z356nmrn32jrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is the possibility that, with admittedly a great deal of work, we could create something which could grow inexorably, spread across the planet and displace or kill many, many forms of life, including us, the animals around us, the plants around us, and even some of the microbes,” said David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who attended the meeting at the University of Manchester’s Institute of Biotechnology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtn85id002k356nrie7q2h2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman, like Adamala, was one of the early members of the working group and remembered keeping initial conversations under wraps. “We didn’t want to be unduly alarmist. We also didn’t want to sound like crackpots,” he recalled. “I think we all hoped that we would quickly learn there was some fatal flaw in this logic, but it started to bother me enough to wake me up at night.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0011356n7upetslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their alarm stemmed from the fact that, because natural life is chiral, interactions between natural organisms and mirror bacteria would be profoundly unpredictable. While the first mirror bacterium would likely be extremely fragile, limiting its growth and survival, it could persist, given the right nutrients. Ultimately, it might act like an invasive species, disrupting ecosystems without predators to keep it in check.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0012356nq1kjgo7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman said mirror bacteria could potentially evade critical parts of plant, animal and human immune systems, which would have difficulty detecting or killing them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0014356npk75jgwb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once inside a human, a mirror bacteria could hypothetically replicate to extremely high levels in the body, causing its host to experience something similar to septic shock. Potential medical countermeasures — including most antibiotics — are chiral, meaning they likely would not be effective on mirror bacteria, although it is possible that mirror versions of antibiotics could be produced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0015356nj4enme5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while biocontainment measures, such as those scientists use to work with dangerous pathogens, could theoretically prevent mirror bacteria from leaving a lab, those measures would be vulnerable to human error or deliberate misuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0016356nvv05rekj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While such a doomsday scenario is far from a sure thing, and there’s great uncertainty about the risks mirror life would pose given it doesn’t yet exist, no one has been able to totally refute the risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0017356n76kuwb0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At first, people were questioning whether those concerns are actually as serious as we thought they were. And so we were trying to poke holes in it, trying to find ways in which we were wrong,” Adamala said. “The more we looked, the more we were certain, and more people were coming on board to this idea that there actually is no safe way to make a mirror cell.”

            Relman characterized mirror life as the first plausible existential risk he had encountered in a long career that has included investigating the&lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/05/us/how-it-really-happened-anthrax-attacks"&gt; 2001 deadly anthrax letters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/new-evidence-havana-syndrome"&gt;Havana Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious health ailment that has impacted spies, soldiers and diplomats around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0019356ngqk2i1t8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said what gives him cause for optimism is the fact that, unlike other contentious and risky areas of science such as cloning, mirror life doesn’t exist yet — it isn’t a “here and now thing” that would be harder to stop. “There’s a real chance we don’t have to have this happen to us unless we choose to do so.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other experts involved in the mirror life discussions in Manchester, however, said it is important to tread cautiously and not make kneejerk decisions that could thwart scientific progress. They emphasized that research to develop individual mirror molecules should be distinguished from that to develop mirror cells or organisms — even though both are sometimes termed mirror life or biology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001h356nnz79w3d7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Michael Kay, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Utah who is focused on developing drugs — primarily against infectious diseases like HIV — based on mirror-image molecules, said he isn’t “so supportive” of red lines that would completely block an area of study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001i356nqp7n27vb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel like they’re too blunt of a tool,” Kay noted, referring to blanket regulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001j356nrghg08ky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the human body doesn’t recognize them as readily, mirror molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids resist degradation and are more stable there — useful traits for potential therapeutic drugs. And since mirror proteins cannot self-replicate, they do not pose the same risks as a mirror cell. However, Kay is worried that through unclear messaging, the word “mirror” will become automatically equated with risky research and it will limit innovation in this area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001k356n2pfj3773@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mirror molecules are inert chemicals with tremendous benefits,” he explained. “This is very early (research), but they’re here and there’s many more in clinical trials. In the next five or 10 years, this is going to be a big class of drugs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001l356n504k1429@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that the risks of mirror cells or organisms, should they be unleashed, are unknown. “This (organism) could just starve to death, which we think is probably the most likely thing, or consume all the resources in the Earth and compete with all existing life,” Kay said. “That’s a huge range.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001m356nt0j0rqzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, he said the ongoing attempts to weigh the risks are important: “I think any effort that buys us time to better understand and better consider the risks and to, you know, just be more deliberate in the way the technologies are advanced, rather than just having a free for all, I think that’s beneficial. And we have the time, you know, for that to happen,” Kay added. “This is not imminent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001o356np0he3n74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many synthetic biologists, including Adamala, are seeking to make a synthetic cell — with natural chirality — from scratch out of non-living parts. The aim is to create something that mimics biological processes to shed light on the cascade of biochemical reactions that allowed life to first arise hundreds of millions of years ago and help solve problems in medicine, industry, the environment and basic research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001p356n3ofoksni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A synthetic cell would be like operating system for life: it would let us engineer biology at unprecedented scale, with precision that we can’t get in natural cells,” Adamala explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001q356n8ogwzm4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will build models of cellular processes, both healthy and diseases, to understand how healthy cells can be made to work better and how diseases start,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001r356nhgj9ujg3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that scientists will hit that milestone of a synthetic non-mirror cell soon, perhaps within a year, according to John Glass, a professor and leader of the La Jolla, California-based J. Craig Venter Institute’s Synthetic Biology Group. And if a normal cell with natural chirality can be created from lifeless molecules, then, in theory, he said a mirror-image cell could be created from mirror-image molecules using the same methods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001s356nrik42meb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glass’ initial conversations with Relman in April 2024 about the potential risks of mirror life left him “shaken,” he remembered. “It made me wonder if the thing, the work that I have been doing for years, could be enabling, one day, the mirror bacteria-based Armageddon that we fear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001t356nbqj40p1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, most experts agree that making a synthetic cell with natural chirality is safe, because if a  bacterium made from a synthetic cell were to enter an environment, it would be subject to the normal controls of any ecosystem, making it easy prey to natural predators such as viruses that target bacteria. Thus, it wouldn’t be able to spread uncontrollably.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001u356ngmnrzd2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Glass, an obvious red line is for scientists to refrain from making a mirror ribosome, a biological machine found in a cell’s cytoplasm that makes proteins. While that advance would  still be far from creating a mirror cell, he said if you instead draw the line at the last step — creating a mirror membrane and then assembling all the constituent parts — it’s too late.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001v356n5skzoscj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kay at the University of Utah feels differently. His lab is focused on improving the chemical synthesis of mirror proteins, a process which is currently very inefficient. As an alternative, he is interested in exploring making a mirror image ribosome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001w356nso4h5p50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea is that if we could make a mirror ribosome, we could then use that to make these products with much higher quality, much longer proteins, in a way that might be compatible with pharmaceutical use,” Kay explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001x356npuumlga0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But there is concern, in this group — and I’m undecided right now — whether having that would be such a valuable tool that it would make the development of mirror life inevitable or too easy for others,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001z356nmzheoyaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adamala, along with her colleagues, chose not to renew her research grant, ending her lab’s work on mirror cells. She is focusing instead on discussions around how to regulate mirror life research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370020356nf7wkqeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To the best of her knowledge, she said, no scientists are pursuing the creation of a mirror cell. In February 2025, nearly 100 researchers, funders and policymakers &lt;a href="https://repository.rice.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/03831782-2fe2-4b00-82ef-781e9c8a0353/content" target="_blank"&gt;signed an entreaty&lt;/a&gt; arguing that “mirror life should not be created unless future research convincingly demonstrates that it would not pose severe risks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370021356n2oafbfag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, signatures and self-restraint may be not enough. Adamala, Glass and Relman all said they hope their conversations will inform more formal restrictions or policies at international or national level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370022356nczk9mr9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was no concrete outcome from the Manchester meeting, and related discussions continued at a September workshop hosted by &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/mirror-image-biology-pushing-the-envelope-in-designing-biological-systems-a-workshop" target="_blank"&gt;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s&lt;/a&gt; Standing Committee on Advances and National Security Implications of Transdisciplinary Biotechnology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370023356nu5q61ltv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pretty much everyone agrees that we should not make a living mirror cell. That’s the baseline but below that people have a lot of different ideas where should we stop the research,” Adamala said. “Right now, the scientific community can’t really agree on the red lines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370024356nlsk3f3vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman said the goal is that the proactive efforts the group is making will not only protect the planet from a doomsday scenario but could help rebuild some of the trust scientists have lost with the public in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370025356nxa4za4a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wouldn’t it be great if we could be the Dr. Ian Malcolm of ‘Jurassic Park’?” he said, referring to the fictional mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum in the 1993 movie, who warns other characters about the potential dangers of unbridled scientific ambition. “We scientists … think about whether we should, not whether we could.”

&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, with 1.3 million people living with the condition, according to &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/zimbabwe" title="External link — figures"&gt;figures&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from UNAIDS, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/united-nations-un/t-17440154"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; program on &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-aids/t-18932088"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern African nation recently met the UNAIDS 95–95-95 fast-track targets, meaning that 95% of those living with HIV know their status; 95% of those who know they have HIV are on life-saving antiretroviral treatment; and 95% of people on treatment achieve viral suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-teams="true"&gt;Ponesai Nyika, a public health expert with extensive experience in HIV/AIDS research and program implementation, told DW that Zimbabwe has a "very solid HIV response infrastructure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of lenacapavir is expected to greatly boost Zimbabwe's efforts to eradicate infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is lenacapavir considered a game changer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; has hailed lenacapavir as a &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" title="External link — transformative step forward"&gt;transformative step forward&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in protecting people at risk of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNAIDS has also described the drug as a watershed moment in HIV response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about it as a potential &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/miracle-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-approved-amid-drastic-us-health-budget-cuts/a-73023089"&gt;miracle drug&lt;/a&gt;," Angeli Achrekar, deputy director of UNAIDS, told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the fact that it is nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections is remarkable, it's unprecedented. It's the best thing we've got in the HIV response. We do not have a vaccine or cure, but this is extraordinary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is expected to be rolled out across 120 low- and middle-income countries by 2027 and is anticipated to significantly reduce the 1.3 million new HIV/AIDS infections yearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika told DW that the drug is seen to be "highly effective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Specifically for HIV prevention, it has been seen to be highly effective, which is what makes it very exciting compared to the others. It is highly effective in preventing HIV infections if used correctly and consistently," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug has gone through two trials: One in sub-Saharan Africa among women and girls, the other among American &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lgbtq-rights/t-17455109"&gt;gay and bisexual men and transgender women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both trials, the efficacy of the drug was more than 99%, raising hope for its "extraordinary" abilities in HIV prevention once fully available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika further explained that the administration of the drug only twice a year makes it even more effective as it reduces incidents of low adherence to HIV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mixed reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Zimbabweans are upbeat about the introduction of the medication, others are more skeptical about the drug's cost, safety and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nyika argues that while lenacapavir — like every new medication — can have some side effects, "the data that we have does show that lenacapavir is very safe and well tolerated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He urged African countries rolling out the drug to be transparent and communicate clearly about any side effects of the drug to aid in its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant praise for the drug, its cost also raises key questions about how accessible this "miracle drug" can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How is it going to help us? Because I'm sure it's for the rich," a Ugandan citizen told DW, reacting to the $40-dollar yearly cost of the drug, which was initially projected to cost about $28,000 (€24,197) per person annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lenacapavir prevention regimen also requires an initial oral dose when starting the regimen: two tablets to be taken on the day of the first injection and two tablets to be taken on the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address cost concerns, Nyika suggested negotiations by middle- and low-income countries and possible local or regional production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These can help bring the cost down, but also leveraging the existing supply chain, community health system and different service delivery modules will help ensure equitable access," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership with PEPFAR and the Global Fund is expected to significantly reduce the pricing of the "miracle drug."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana are also among those countries selected for the rollout by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

My mind was in a spin,” she said, calling the diagnosis “a big shock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brinklow received some positive news — the cancer hadn’t spread beyond her right breast — she still needed to undergo a double mastectomy as her cancer was&lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-diagnosed-with-two-types-of-breast-cancer-in-one-breast-shares-her-story-8714706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:positive for estrogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; positive for estrogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that means it’s less aggressive, as the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/er-positive-breast-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains, “There’s a risk of recurrence after treatment, including treatment for early-stage, low-risk ER-positive breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow was back on her feet as soon as possible: “Following surgery I was out walking for miles every day. You could say I walked myself better.” Her motivation, she said, was her music, as she explained, “When you play the bagpipes you really do need to be able to raise your arms up above your head … lots of women don’t get their full mobility back [after surgery].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Brinklow / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Julie Brinklow in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery is “a very slow process,” Brinklow says, adding that she’s “still improving all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I am back to doing everything that I used to do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow hopes her story can warn others that breast cancer comes in all shapes and sizes. As she explained, “I probably wouldn’t have done anything about it if I hadn’t been nagged. A tumor doesn’t have to be a small hard lump, it can be something that just feels like a thickness that you haven’t noticed before, like part of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t delay in getting checked out if you think there is something different or that you haven’t noticed before,” she said. “The thing that sticks in my mind is that I wasn’t worried about it, and I should have been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Brinklow for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/musician-thought-she-strained-herself-playing-the-bagpipes-11826967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 06:08:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBpaU90TEVfdXlJWFgtZWdZN0IxZmtucEdUUkI0TE1MSk1rekpsRnZTU0I3SzVGMnZxZ1R5R3VUQjdaU1lWcW9VR3VfUEg5TlVsX19LRjFNbm4zcFhJNnMyN2pLMWJTbzFiS2NRdUZDQThQNzN4</guid></item><item><title>使用这位培训师的简单日常挑战- Fit&amp;Well ，只需五分钟即可提高平衡感</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/it-only-takes-two-minutes-to-boost-your-balance-with-this-trainers-simple-daily-challenge</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound"&gt;Ultrasound is generated&lt;/a&gt; with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.26.2.179"&gt;heat up and destroy&lt;/a&gt; brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain, and even  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Frontal brain MRI" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red.

For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/17/r206"&gt;eventually overcame this problem&lt;/a&gt; by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/indication-development-pipeline/"&gt;Hundreds of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found notable success on a condition called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1600159"&gt;essential tremor&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/diseases-and-conditions/essential-tremor/"&gt;performed routinely at many locations&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delivering drugs to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier-and-how-can-we-overcome-it-75454"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is evolution's exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2202001804"&gt;temporarily open the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061230"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4011"&gt;brain metastases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2022.114583"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/boyer-lectures-gene-therapy-is-still-in-its-infancy-but-the-future-looks-promising-104558"&gt;Gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay1344"&gt;facilitate the delivery of gene therapies&lt;/a&gt; to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulating immune responses against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/anti-cancer-car-t-therapy-reengineers-t-cells-to-kill-tumors-and-researchers-are-expanding-the-limited-types-of-cancer-it-can-target-196471"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; instructs the patient's own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma – have tumors that are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01979-x"&gt;immunologically "cold,"&lt;/a&gt; meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92089"&gt;better recognize and destroy cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-ultrasound-helmet-reaches-deep-inside-the-brain-without-surgery"&gt;New Ultrasound Helmet Reaches Deep Inside The Brain Without Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world's first &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/uva-focused-ultrasound-cancer-immunotherapy-center/"&gt;focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, my colleagues are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472661"&gt;running a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-cancer-cells-can-become-immortal-research-finds-a-mutated-gene-that-helps-melanoma-defeat-the-normal-limits-on-repeated-replication-194234"&gt;advanced melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/SVIN.123.001140"&gt;cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM&lt;/a&gt;. CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0439"&gt;debilitating neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113861"&gt;improve drug delivery to CCMs&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01390-z"&gt;stop CCMs from growing&lt;/a&gt; in mice, even without administering a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don't yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/25424823251343789"&gt;abundant research on the safety&lt;/a&gt; of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262622/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Despite being so easy and accessible, walking is often underrated. You don’t need fancy gear, a gym membership, or a strict routine, just comfy shoes and a bit of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s always a bit of confusion about when to walk, before meals, right after, or later in the day?

"For people with diabetes or prediabetes, this habit can significantly lower post-meal glucose and even reduce HbA1c over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He discourages walking immediately after meals. "Walking immediately after finishing a meal (within 0–5 min) is still beneficial, but some people may feel discomfort or bloating, especially after a heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's the right time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start 10–15 minutes after eating," says the doctor. "This timing coincides with the period when blood glucose levels begin to rise as the meal is being digested and glucose is entering the bloodstream," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"10–20 minutes of light to moderate walking (at 3–4 km/hour pace) is usually enough to blunt the glucose spike. A longer 30-minute walk can provide additional benefits, especially after carbohydrate-rich meals," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But, wait, are you walking the right way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest exercises, but surprisingly, a few common mistakes can really sabotage its benefits. First off, walking too slowly or without purpose won’t get your heart rate up enough to boost fitness or burn calories. It’s okay to stroll, but adding a bit of pace or some arm movement makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, ignoring posture can cause neck, back, or shoulder strain — stand tall, engage your core, and swing your arms naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is skipping consistency; walking once in a while won’t do much, so make it a regular habit, even if it’s just 15 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong footwear is a sneaky culprit too — shoes that don’t support your feet can lead to pain or injuries, which kills motivation. Also, walking on the same route all the time can get boring and reduce effort; mix it up with different paths, trails, or slight inclines to challenge your body. Finally, forgetting hydration or ignoring body signals can make walking uncomfortable or even risky, especially in hot weather. Walking is amazing, but doing it smartly is what really delivers results!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，这种常见的早晨习惯无声地损害动脉；可使心脏死亡风险增加87 ％ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/this-common-morning-habit-is-silently-damaging-arteries-can-increase-heart-death-risk-by-87-says-study/articleshow/124619416.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we start our mornings has a lot to do with how the rest of the day is going to go. From picking up mobile phones after waking up, to struggling to get that one cup of coffee, all morning rituals matter. At first, these might seem harmless but medical professionals are now concerned about how morning habits contribute to clogged arteries, which harm our cardiovascular health. One of the habits, as research points out, is skipping breakfast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the breakfast meal has been hailed as vital. But with busy lives, increasing numbers of people are skipping breakfast altogether or consuming things on the go, (which is also pretty harmful) ,pushing back the morning meal in the guise of intermittent fasting, weight management, or time pressures. Research now indicates this practice is potentially much worse than it looks, especially for cardiovascular and arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How it influences the health of arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arteries transport oxygen-carrying blood from the heart to all cells throughout the body. Over time, it may become constricted because of the buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis. When this occurs gradually and silently, it raises the threat of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping breakfast also sets off a sequence of physiological events that can hasten the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that individuals who usually skip breakfast are likely to have higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol, increased blood pressure, and increased insulin resistance. All these three factors combined raise the risk of arterial plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body is starved of nutrients in the morning, it compensates by releasing stress hormones such as cortisol. This surge of hormones raises inflammation, which is central to the hardening of arteries. Furthermore, individuals who eat breakfast skip meals later in the day, gobbling high-calorie or processed foods that increase triglyceride levels and put pressure on the vascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109717393178" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;tudy looked at how breakfast habits relate to the early stages of artery disease.

A different study conducted in Spain revealed individuals who routinely skipped breakfast had thicker walls in their carotid arteries, a primary indicator of nascent atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe this connection is not just about what one eats, but WHEN one eats. The body follows a circadian rhythm, and eating in alignment with that rhythm helps regulate metabolism and blood sugar levels. Skipping breakfast disrupts this rhythm, forcing the body into a stress state that promotes fat storage and inflammation — both harmful to arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why symptoms often go unnoticed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most troubling aspect of this condition is that it advances stealthily. Atherosclerosis becomes established over a long period of years, and frequently decades, with no apparent symptoms until a dramatic event occurs. Preliminary symptoms such as minor fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath are usually attributed to normal fatigue. When the individual develops chest pain or heart attack, the disease is well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests, lipid profile testing, and imaging scans such as carotid ultrasound are the only dependable methods to diagnose changes within arteries early. Physicians also stress the need to monitor blood sugar and blood pressure levels since both are highly correlated with vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to keep your arteries healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution starts with returning balance to the morning routine. Having a healthy breakfast regulates metabolism and enhances steady energy levels. Nutritionists suggest incorporating foods high in fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats — like oats, nuts, seeds, fruits, and whole grains. These reduce LDL cholesterol and guard the inner wall of blood vessels. In all this, hydration is equally important, water helps in flushing out toxins from the body, and regulates all processes of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is steering clear of processed breakfast foods filled with added sugars or trans fats.

If your kid is afraid to go to school, terrified of germs, or trapped in a world constrained by fear, it can feel like eternity. Trust me; I remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A child’s brain is a sponge. What OCD does, what anxiety does, is it robs a child of the chance to really experience the world on their own terms. We want to help them change their relationship with the OCD. We’re not going to make it go away; we’re going to help the child, parents, school, everybody, respond to these emotions in a different way that’s more productive,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My experience mirrors the typical trajectory. About 1 in 5 cases begins by age 10, with upticks around puberty and young adulthood. OCD isn’t caused by parenting, Potter says. It reflects a sensitive brain alarm system, partly genetic, shaped by environmental and developmental changes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Genetics contributes 40 to 50 percent of the risk of OCD; the genetic contribution appears to be higher in childhood-onset than in adult-onset disease,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And while awareness has grown, treatment delays are still common: Many kids still go years before an accurate diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“With early recognition and evidence-based care, OCD is highly treatable,” Potter says. In honor of all those kids who used to struggle in silence — and those who still do — here’s what to know about OCD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD is: &lt;/b&gt;OCD is diagnosed when intrusive thoughts, images, or urges cause anxiety. As a result, the sufferer feels compelled to perform actions or mental rituals to get relief, so much so that it disrupts life, Potter says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Obsessions are persistent, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause distress (like my fixation on ear lumps). Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental rituals to reduce distress or prevent something bad from happening. They can be behavioral and visible — like hand-washing or checking — or invisible, like counting or praying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sometimes, compulsions are related to a fear (like checking a stove to make sure you turned it off so the house doesn’t burn down); other times, they aren’t logical (walking on a certain side of the road to keep your parents safe). Most of all, these obsessions or compulsions consume time, often more than an hour per day. They’re exhausting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, saddest of all, many kids “know behaviors are hurting their lives or are distressed by them, but they still feel unable to stop. Shame is common and delays asking for help,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are lots of OCD strains: fear of contamination; needing things to be perfectly symmetrical; relationship doubts with checking and reassurance; and existential worries, such as rumination about death or mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD isn’t:&lt;/b&gt; Lots of people have daily rituals, like tapping a can of Diet Coke before opening it or lighting a candle when walking into a room. The difference? These behaviors are grounding, and they’re optional. If you can’t do them for some reason — let’s say you’re out of matches — you can move on. With OCD, functioning stalls until the behavior is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s exhausting, not because the person wants to think this way, but because the OCD is directing them. It’s like having mental pop-up ads. Our minds usually click them away quickly and without much thought, but in OCD, the pop-ups stick around and start taking over, and even if you do what they say and click them away, they come back,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it’s treated&lt;/b&gt;: The good news is, OCD is highly treatable. The gold standard is exposure and response prevention. This is a specialized form of cognitive behavioral therapy that re-trains the brain’s alarm system by facing triggers (or exposures) and by resisting the corresponding ritual (response prevention).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s an example: For a long time, I avoided walking up flights of stairs, because it would make my heart race, which I’d then obsess over. My heart was definitely about to explode. So my therapist made me walk up and down several flights, creating the very symptoms I avoided — and realize that, no, my heart wasn’t going to collapse. With ERP, Potter says, more than 70 percent of kids improve significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Medication also helps. It won’t erase the OCD; instead, think of it as a way to turn down the noise and reduce symptom intensity, making therapy more fruitful. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the most commonly prescribed medications for OCD. I take Prozac.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What parents can do&lt;/b&gt;: For support, Potter recommends resources including the International OCD Foundation and Anxiety and Depression Association of America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You can also try to separate your child from the OCD by externalizing it: “This is OCD talking, not you.” Some kids find it helpful to give it a name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve had kids give it the funniest names. They’ll call it Broccoli. My favorite was Miggy, after amygdala, our limbic fear system,” Potter says. “The idea is externalizing the OCD. OCD is trying to tell you what to do and trying to say that, if you don’t do this, then your day is going to be bad or a bad outcome is going to happen. But this is OCD: You don’t always need to listen to OCD.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Notice, name, and respond deliberately. “When OCD tries to run the show, pause before problem-solving or directing. Lead with empathy: notice and name what your child is feeling, reflect it with your words and body language, and then gently pivot to action by coaching one tiny step toward what they’re avoiding,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most of all, don’t accommodate the OCD. This might seem counterintuitive: You don’t want your kid to be upset; neither do their teachers or friends. But accommodation can backfire in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Parents often buffer distress by answering reassurance questions, assisting in avoidance behaviors, or creating work-arounds. It helps in the moment but grows OCD over time because it takes away the opportunity for kids to learn that, yes, they can really handle a challenging situation,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are ‘nice’ by trying to reduce distress in the moment, but the ‘kind’ thing to do is to show kids we believe in them and know they can handle it. There’s a concept in schools [that] moved from helicopter parenting to lawnmower parenting, where the urge is to clear the path for our kids. But that deprives them of the chance to build muscles and see that they can handle and get through the muck.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As psychologists Alex Jordan and Ben Levett &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt; in the Globe: “Anxiety feeds on avoidance,” they wrote. “When students take on what they’d rather avoid, they learn that worst-case scenarios rarely materialize, that discomfort is survivable, and that anxiety diminishes with practice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finally, praise their efforts. When your kid takes a step away from an OCD behavior and tolerates uncertainty, name it out loud: “You felt the urge and still chose bravery,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How a kid can explain OCD to their friends&lt;/b&gt;: I wished I’d had a way to explain what was going on in my brain when I was younger. My mind felt like a CD that kept skipping. People couldn’t really relate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s what Potter suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Younger kids could say, “Sometimes my brain gets stuck on worries. It tells me I have to check or repeat things to feel safe. I’m learning how to ignore those false alarms so my brain can calm down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Teens could say, “I have OCD, so my brain sends false alarms. I feel like I have to do things a certain way to calm down. I’m practicing not doing the rituals so I can retrain my brain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you’re dealing with friends or family who just don’t quite get it? Try this: “Everyone gets random thoughts. Mine sometimes get stuck and feel important even when they aren’t. I’m learning to face them without rituals so I can get my freedom back.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And for anyone currently struggling? Take it from me: You really can get your freedom back, and you will. This illness is part of you, but it doesn’t define you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

    &lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are everywhere – lined up on pharmacy shelves and promoted on wellness blogs and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dra_says/video/7399633468839185696?lang=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a friend or family member who swears a daily tablet will help everything, from better sleep to alleviating muscle cramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you really need one? Or it is just marketing hype?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is magnesium and why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential metal the body needs to make and operate more than 300 different enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:%7E:text=consumer%20fact%20sheet.-,Introduction,L%20%5B1%2C5%5D."&gt;enzymes&lt;/a&gt; build protein, and regulate muscle and nerve function, help in the release of energy from our food, and help to maintain blood function. The body doesn’t produce magnesium so we need to get it from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/magnesium"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily magnesium dose of 310–420 mg  a day for adults and 30–410 mg  for children, depending on age and sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easily met through a good diet. Foods &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/foods-high-in-magnesium"&gt;rich in magnesium&lt;/a&gt; include nuts and seeds, whole grains, seafood, meat, legumes and green leafy vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even get some of your magnesium needs met through &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170271/nutrients"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. It has 146 mg per 100 g of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I know if I’m deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;at risk of experiencing magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include people with restricted diets, gastrointestinal problems such as Crohn’s and coeliac diseases, type 2 diabetes, and alcohol dependence. Older adults are also more likely to be deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will only need a magnesium supplement if you &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/magnesium-deficiency"&gt;show signs of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most common signs is muscle spasms and twitches. Other symptoms to look out for include low appetite, nausea and vomiting, or your heart beating abnormally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium deficiency can be properly diagnosed by a blood test ordered by your doctor. If you need this test, it’s covered by &lt;a href="https://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/search.cfm?q=magnesium&amp;amp;sopt=S"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What conditions can it help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium supplements have been promoted to prevent muscle cramps, manage insomnia and help with migraines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While magnesium deficiency is linked to &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;muscle cramps&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of most muscle cramps is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;unknown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the current evidence does not demonstrate that magnesium supplements can prevent muscle cramps in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Nial Wheate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is conflicting data as to whether the use of magnesium helps with sleep. One study reported magnesium was able to reduce the time for a person to fall asleep by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-024-04721-w"&gt;17.4 minutes&lt;/a&gt; while others didn’t &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.59317"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139319"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-024-07794-0"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent research suggests taking 122-600 mg of magnesium supplements daily for 4–24 weeks may decrease their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are magnesium supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are generally well tolerated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, abdominal cramping and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;diarrhoea&lt;/a&gt;. Magnesium causes diarrhoea by drawing water into the intestine and stimulating movement in the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to take too much magnesium and you can &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/magnesium-overdose-whats-the-likelihood"&gt;overdose&lt;/a&gt; on it. Very large doses, around &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323349#likelihood-of-an-overdose"&gt;5,000 mg per day&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to magnesium toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the research investigating the clinical use of magnesium focuses on magnesium in &lt;a href="https://www.nmi.health/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NMJ_Magnesium_A-Review-of-Clinical-Use-and-Efficacy.pdf"&gt;oral&lt;/a&gt; formulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other formulations are available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As magnesium is a small metal ion, it can &lt;a href="https://www.jle.com/fr/revues/mrh/e-docs/permeation_of_topically_applied_magnesium_ions_through_human_skin_is_facilitated_by_hair_follicles_307878/article.phtml"&gt;pass through skin&lt;/a&gt; – but not easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium bath salts, patches and topical cream-based formulations may be able to raise your blood magnesium levels to some extent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But due to the amount needed each day, tablets and foods are a better source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to watch out for when taking magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium products can vary widely in dose, formulation and cost. Magnesium supplements have between 150 to 350 mg of the metal per tablet. Your required dose will depend on your age and sex, and whether you have any underlying health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements sometimes contain other vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins C and D, and the metals calcium, chromium and manganese. So it’s important to consider the total quantities if you’re taking other vitamins and supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many magnesium supplements also include vitamin B6. While this vitamin is important for supporting the immune system, high intakes can it can cause serious &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/too-much-vitamin-b6-can-be-toxic-3-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-260400"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re already taking a B6 supplement, a magnesium supplement that also includes it can put you at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1940661205221154954"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What if you’re considering supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you might be deficient in magnesium, speak to your doctor who can order a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suffer from migraines, cramps, or poor sleep, talk to your doctor or pharmacist who can advise on and monitor the underlying cause. It may be that a change in lifestyle or an alternative treatment may be more appropriate for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to take a magnesium supplement, check you won’t be taking too much of any other vitamin or mineral. A pharmacist can help select a supplement that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Beyond building muscles or burning calories, regular movement can physically reshape the brain and sharpen memory. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO),&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; over 1 in 4 adults globally are not active enough, leading not only to physical but also mental decline. And that’s where neuroscientists like Dr Wendy Suzuki, a leading brain researcher at New York University, bring clarity: exercise isn’t just good for the body, it literally changes the brain’s structure and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science of the “sweaty brain”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wendy Suzuki’s research, as shared on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMvNqW2RE2d/?igsh=MWJyb2tpcGF3cWtjaA%3D%3D" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Diary Of A CEO podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reveals something remarkable: every drop of sweat strengthens the brain. In her lab studies, even participants who moved their bodies for 45 minutes, two to three times a week, showed measurable improvements in memory, mood, and focus. This happens because exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the hippocampus, the region responsible for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, consistent workouts make the hippocampus stronger and thicker, almost like growing “mental muscles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means clearer thinking, faster recall, and a sharper sense of focus in everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The minimum dose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those not used to exercise, Suzuki’s team discovered a very hopeful number: two to three 45-minute aerobic sessions a week. That’s enough to begin changing how the brain functions. These sessions can include cycling, brisk walking, swimming, or dancing, anything that raises the heart rate and keeps it there steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks, participants reported better memory retention and a noticeable lift in mood. The beauty of this discovery is that the brain responds to movement much faster than expected, it doesn’t need months to notice improvement; even a few weeks can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The brain’s sweet spot&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While two or three sessions are a great start, Suzuki’s second study revealed something even more exciting. Among regular exercisers, the more they moved, the greater the brain benefit. Those who increased activity up to six or seven days a week experienced continuous improvements in hippocampal growth, prefrontal function (decision-making and planning), and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this means around 4-5 total hours of aerobic exercise per week is an ideal target for sharper memory and stronger cognitive control. That could be 45 minutes daily for five days, or longer, lighter walks mixed with occasional intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why aerobic workouts rewire the brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic workouts stand out because they flood the brain with oxygen and trigger the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a kind of “fertilizer” for brain cells. BDNF helps neurons grow stronger and connect better, improving learning and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also lowers the levels of stress hormones like cortisol, which can otherwise shrink brain regions responsible for memory. In other words, every jog, spin class, or dance session helps the brain defend itself against ageing and stress while staying alert and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mood-memory connection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Suzuki’s most heartwarming findings is how mood improvement precedes cognitive gains. When exercise lifts emotional state, by releasing endorphins and serotonin, the brain becomes more ready to absorb and store information. Happiness, it turns out, sharpens focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might explain why many people find their most creative or clearest thoughts appear after a workout. The emotional uplift primes the brain to remember and problem-solve better, creating a powerful loop of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every drop of sweat counts, literally&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most comforting insight from Suzuki’s research is that there’s no wasted effort. Even short bursts of physical activity, climbing stairs, dancing while cooking, or a brisk 15-minute walk, contribute to brain growth. The key is consistency, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these small moments of movement add up, helping the brain become, as Suzuki puts it, “big, fat, and fluffy,” meaning healthy, resilient, and full of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is meant for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

For example, people might worry someone like parents or housemates could find their pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Homelessness and domestic violence can make it difficult to take oral PrEP every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An injection which lasts for months offers convenience and discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;HIV is a virus that damages the cells in the immune system and weakens the body's ability to fight everyday infections and diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It can be caught during unprotected sex or through sharing needles.

			&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen is a household name – the go-to remedy for everything from headaches to period pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent research suggests this everyday drug might be doing more than easing discomfort. It could also have anti- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="177986" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists uncover more about the links between inflammation and cancer, ibuprofen's role is coming under the spotlight – raising intriguing questions about how something so familiar might offer unexpected protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-blocks-multiple-tumors-in-mice-for-250-days"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Blocks Multiple Tumors in Mice For 250 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) family. The connection between NSAIDs and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-prevention-37896"&gt;cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt; isn't new: as far back as 1983, clinical evidence linked sulindac – an older prescription NSAID similar to ibuprofen – to a reduced incidence of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/colon-cancer-4369"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in certain patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, researchers have been investigating whether these drugs could help prevent or slow other cancers too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177990" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642.jpg" alt="A Common Pain Relief Drug May Have Anti-Cancer Properties" class="size-full wp-image-177990" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ibuprofen_pack_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177990" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ibuprofen is a form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relief.

There are two main types. COX-1 helps protect the stomach lining, maintains kidney function, and plays a role in blood clotting. COX-2, on the other hand, drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit both, which is why doctors recommend taking them with food rather than on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen and endometrial cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;A 2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that ibuprofen may lower the risk of endometrial cancer, the most common type of womb cancer, which starts in the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) and mainly affects women after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest preventable &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/womb-cancer/risks-causes"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for endometrial cancer is being overweight or obese, since excess body fat increases levels of oestrogen – a hormone that can stimulate cancer cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include older age, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; (particularly oestrogen-only HRT),  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177986" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Early onset of menstruation, late menopause, or not having children also increases risk. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/womb-cancer/symptoms/"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study&lt;/a&gt;, data from more than 42,000 women aged 55–74 was analysed over 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who reported taking at least 30 ibuprofen tablets per month had a 25% lower risk of developing endometrial cancer than those taking fewer than four tablets monthly. The protective effect appeared strongest among women with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, aspirin – another common NSAID – did not show the same association with reduced risk in this or &lt;a href="https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(17)31448-8/abstract"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;. That said, aspirin may help &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;prevent bowel cancer from returning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other NSAIDs, such as naproxen, have been studied for preventing &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/2/11/951/47850/Chemopreventive-Efficacy-of-Naproxen-and-Nitric"&gt;colon, bladder, and breast cancers&lt;/a&gt;. The effectiveness of these drugs seems to depend on cancer type, genetics, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen's broader potential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen's possible cancer-protective effects extend beyond endometrial cancer. Studies suggest it may also reduce risk of bowel, breast, lung, and prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people who &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6188"&gt;previously had bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; and took ibuprofen were less likely to experience recurrence. It has also been shown to &lt;a href="https://mbrc.shirazu.ac.ir/article_6973.html"&gt;inhibit colon cancer growth and survival&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2017.1239"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; even suggests a protective effect against lung cancer in smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177993" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642.jpg" alt="illustration of bowel cancer location" class="wp-image-177993 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/bowel_cancer_ibuprofen_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177993" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bowel cancer was found to return less in people who took ibuprofen. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3xXkB9k/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and ibuprofen is, at its core, anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By blocking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047847714002433?via%3Dihub"&gt;COX-2 enzyme activity&lt;/a&gt;, the drug reduces production of prostaglandins, chemical messengers that drive inflammation and cell growth – including &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/6/1487"&gt;cancer cell growth&lt;/a&gt;. Lower prostaglandin levels may slow or stop tumour development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's only part of the story. Ibuprofen also appears to influence cancer-related genes such as &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323635"&gt;HIF-1α, NFκB, and STAT3&lt;/a&gt;, which help tumour cells survive in low-oxygen conditions and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen seems to reduce the activity of these genes, making cancer cells more vulnerable. It can also alter how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-020-0906-7"&gt;DNA is packaged within cells&lt;/a&gt;, potentially making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A word of caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all research points in the same direction. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.35363"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 7,751 patients found that taking aspirin after an endometrial cancer diagnosis was linked to higher mortality, particularly among those who had used aspirin before diagnosis. Other NSAIDs also appeared to increase cancer-related death risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)10411-7?uuid=uuid%3A36697d88-ee94-4d3c-8754-db42e17bde1b"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; found that NSAIDs, especially aspirin, may reduce the risk of several cancers – though regular use of other NSAIDs could raise the risk of kidney cancer. These conflicting results show how complex the interaction between inflammation, immunity, and cancer really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise, experts warn against self-medicating with ibuprofen for cancer prevention. Long-term or high-dose NSAID use can cause serious &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nsaids-prescribing-issues/management/nsaids-prescribing-issues/#:%7E:text=Cardiovascular%20and%20renal%20complications%20are,cardiac%20or%20renal%20adverse%20events."&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach ulcers, gut bleeding, and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less commonly, they may trigger &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5422108/"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart attacks or strokes. NSAIDs also interact with several medications, including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-199630060-00002"&gt;warfarin&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/18/7/1062"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the risk of bleeding and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-medicine-may-stop-colorectal-cancer-from-returning"&gt;A Common Medicine May Stop Colorectal Cancer From Returning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that a humble painkiller could help prevent cancer is both exciting and provocative. If future studies confirm these findings, ibuprofen might one day form part of a broader strategy for reducing cancer risk, especially in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, experts agree it's wiser to focus on lifestyle-based prevention: eating anti-inflammatory foods, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine/patient/endometrial-prevention-pdq#:%7E:text=of%20endometrial%20cancer.-,The%20following%20protective%20factors%20decrease%20the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer,the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer."&gt;maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday medicines may yet hold surprising promise, but until the science is settled, the safest prescription for cancer prevention remains the oldest one: eat well, move often, and listen to your doctor before reaching for the pill bottle.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266645/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

According to one new study, the so-called "dopamine detox" trend doesn't have a whole lot of merit. And not only that, but it's come to overshadow a handful of other practices that not only manage dopamine better, but have longer-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 activities that will actually give you a better 'dopamine detox' than avoiding screens:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dopamine Detox" has become a hot online trend for overcoming the ills of screen addiction, all with a deceptively simple premise: Taking breaks from screens or even just "raw-dogging" flights with no screens of any kind can "detox" your brain from dopamine, the neurotransmitter that governs pleasure, reward, and motivatio,n and which is heavily involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems reasonable enough, right? You avoid the thing you're addicted to, the addictive mechanism is cut off, and you're "detoxed" from its effects. But the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-dopamine-detox-and-do-i-need-one-254813" rel="nofollow"&gt;science so far &lt;/a&gt;says there's really not much of anything to this. (Note: This research pertains to adults. Kids are a whole other ball of wax when it comes to the impacts of screens!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, dopamine is a necessary neurotransmitter we actually need to function, not some poison that needs shedding. But the idea of "detoxing" from dopamine is alluring, especially because when people try it, they do usually notice changes, especially negative ones like craving the very screens they've just given up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mechanism is very real. But there's a major distinction missing from all this viral discourse: Scientists say it's not so much that we're getting MORE dopamine that is the problem, but rather that we're getting dopamine hits so OFTEN and so QUICKLY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It basically overwhelms the system, which is why scientists say replacing "fast dopamine" with one (or all) of these four "slow dopamine" activities will not only help ease screentime overstimulation but also yield lasting, more complete results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/toyoake-japanese-city-limits-screen-time-2-hours-day"&gt;Welcome To Toyoake, A Japanese City Where Screen Time Is Limited To 2 Hours A Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

But it can be as simple as just going for a regular walk. No need to become an Olympic powerlifter. But physical exercise not only helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978/" rel="nofollow"&gt;boost and manage dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, but also levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, too, much like antidepressants do. The difference, again, is that it does so in natural doses in a natural rhythm rather than the bombardment that doomscrolling provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Creative projects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-exercise-creative.png" alt="man painting a picture" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens creative" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Mehmet Turgut Kirkgoz | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's painting, gardening, knitting, or bonsai trimming, creative projects and dopamine have a beneficial push-pull relationship. Creative projects provide &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4718590/" rel="nofollow"&gt;pleasure that releases dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, and creativity is enhanced by that release.

Science has long known that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889690/" rel="nofollow"&gt;face-to-face interactions &lt;/a&gt;tell the brain to release dopamine, giving us all kinds of positive benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much like with creative projects, it has a knock-on effect.

			&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; progresses, harmful protein clumps build up in the brain, blocking communications between neurons and killing them off – but what if we could prevent these clusters from forming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from the University of Bath in the UK have achieved just that in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;basic worm model&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. They engineered a peptide, a small amino acid chain, to essentially keep a protein called alpha-synuclein locked in its healthy shape. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"&gt;prevented the misfolding&lt;/a&gt; that leads to clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; checks several important boxes: it's durable, and it can survive inside cells without causing any toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's Disease Could Be Ignited by Burned-Out Brain Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Jody Mason, from the University of Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study follows on from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2023.101563"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers, which identified part of the alpha-synuclein protein that may stop it building to dangerous levels. This key part or fragment acts like a guide for the protein to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg" alt="Peptide and protein diagram" class="wp-image-176560 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-560x415.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-600x445.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team used a shortened peptide to make sure alpha-synuclein proteins behaved. (Meade et al., &lt;em&gt;JACS Au&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fragment was then cut down into the smallest possible size to form the new peptide tested here. The researchers also added extra stability to their peptide molecule, using chemical structures called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"&gt;lactam bridges&lt;/a&gt; to stop it from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the peptide created by the researchers can patrol cells and prevent misfolding without interfering with the normal, healthy job that alpha-synuclein is there for: regulating neurotransmitter signaling chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dopamine-doesnt-work-in-our-brains-quite-the-way-we-thought"&gt;such as dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of finding effective &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;treatments for Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and other diseases like it, is that it can be difficult to disentangle the causes of the condition from the consequences – are alpha-synuclein protein clumps appearing because of the effects of Parkinson's, for example, or helping to drive its progression?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the treatment outlined here seems preventative. It could eventually be used to stop proteins from building up in the brains of people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;at risk of developing Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, rather than breaking up existing protein clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Astronaut in space, with text overlay" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177074" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's a lot of progress to be made – including figuring out the best way to deliver these peptides into the body (which will be significantly more difficult for humans than it is with worms) – but the early signs from this research are positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also want to explore using similar techniques for related conditions, including Lewy body dementia and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which are characterized by dangerous protein clumps of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Julia Dudley, the head of research at  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which helped fund this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.5c00694"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The second, &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=5160&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, was in a Los Angeles County resident. Both patients had to be hospitalized but are now recovering at home, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the overall risk of ... exposure to the public remains low, we are taking this very seriously,” Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson said in a statement. “This underscores the importance of continued surveillance, early response and vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of mpox is different  from the one that spawned &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-07/mpx-cases-decline-los-angeles"&gt;a global outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, which is known as “Clade II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade I is potentially even more concerning, however, because it may cause more severe illness and spread more easily, “including through close personal contact,” such as massage or cuddling, in addition to sex, the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of cases of Clade I mpox, which may cause more severe illness than the more-common Clade II, is concerning,” L.A. County health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health said last year that Clade I has historically caused more severe illness than Clade II, but &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-036.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; that “recent infections from Clade I mpox may not be as clinically severe as in previous outbreaks, especially when cases have access to quality medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is primarily spread through close, intimate contact, such as through body fluids, sores, shared bedding or shared clothing, as well as kissing, coughing and sneezing, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell-tale symptoms “include rash or unusual sores that look like pimples or pus-filled blisters on the face, body and genitals, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches or swelling of lymph nodes,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. Other symptoms can include a sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who develops an unexplained rash or lesions should avoid sex and intimate contact and seek medical evaluation as soon as possible,” the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should get tested if they have symptoms, officials said. Those who have symptoms should also avoid sex or close contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade II mpox generally causes mild-to-moderate illness and has been circulating at low levels throughout the United States since 2022, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 118 cases of Clade II mpox reported to the L.A. County Department of Public Health so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this week, there had been a total of six &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of Clade I mpox in the U.S. — all among people who had recently traveled to areas where this type of mpox is circulating, namely central and eastern Africa. None of those cases was  linked to each other, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says there have been more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40,000 cases of Clade I mpox&lt;/a&gt; in central and eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the countries with confirmed cases, multiple modes of Clade I mpox transmission have been documented, including “contact with infected dead or live wild animals” and “household contact often involving crowded households,” in addition to sexual contact, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39e6c30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c88c932/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbbd947/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f574188/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2851685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Countries in central and eastern Africa that have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cdd6d31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d1ecbf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2fbbeb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff2fda8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;These countries in central and eastern Africa have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the general U.S. population in the U.S. from Clade I mpox is considered “low,” the CDC says.

That person had mild illness, the San Mateo County health department &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.smcgov.org/ceo/news/san-mateo-county-health-responds-new-mpox-strain" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected get better within two to four weeks, the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said, “but antiviral treatments may be considered for individuals with or at risk of developing severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-dose Jynneos &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is also available to help prevent the spread of mpox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who only got one dose can get their second doses “no matter how long it’s been since the first dose,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are widely available, and can be found at pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS. People can look up locations to get vaccinated through the vaccine’s manufacturer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fempoweredagainstmpox.com%2F%3Futm_content=%26utm_medium=email%26utm_name=%26utm_source=govdelivery%26utm_term=%23locator-map/1/01000199ee69436e-f5d64ed8-741e-4092-b7a9-57396cb267d8-000000/tA7ggaQrerUoABOTVMH8kqdw1N0C9Q35BAxTw78Y0eo=427" target="_blank"&gt;Bavarian Nordic&lt;/a&gt;.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first U.S. cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the public is low, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not the U.S. first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-outbreak-who-f1c5d501223ccf3b53c6d9a2727d5c8a"&gt;Mpox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-public-health-emergency-us-f336fc99abd57f0866a38b578d5bb44c"&gt;was averaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; close to 500 cases per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-health-medication-public-313a2781a28f6b17230843432a609118"&gt;later that year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mpox-health-world-health-organization-c39dea7fa56622eaab680bcb2ad7eeec"&gt;had waned enough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that it was no longer an international emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maya Rudolph juggles motherhood and fame, cherishing family dinners despite her kids’ busy schedules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Her go-to meal is miso-glazed salmon with roasted sweet potatoes—a fiber- and omega-3-rich combo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rudolph’s dish supports gut health thanks to fermented miso and nutrient-packed sweet potatoes and salmon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maya Rudolph may be the star of &lt;em&gt;Loot&lt;/em&gt; and one of the most iconic &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; alums out there, but at the end of the day, she’s also a mom trying to get her family together at the dinner table. The actor appeared on the &lt;a href="https://www.tablemannerspodcast.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table Manners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast this week, where she dished about her favorite foods and lamented that family dinners are fewer and farther between now that her kids are getting older.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We try,” said Rudolph, who has four kids with long-time partner and filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson (known as PTA to cinephiles), of structured family dinners. “We used to when they were little but now I feel like having children? Everything they do after school feels like it has become professional-level … so no one is ever home at the same time.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, dinnertime isn’t always &lt;em&gt;One Battle After Another&lt;/em&gt; for Rudolph and PTA, and this is in part to their kids’ love of discovering trending recipes on social media. “The kids love to look at things on Instagram,” said Rudolph. “My oldest daughter, Pearl, loves to find recipes and we found this recipe for—I forget what they’re called but you take a potato and you put a chopstick underneath and you slice it really really thin—hasselback. I don’t have the time to do that so I really just throw sweet potatoes in the oven. I love a sweet potato maybe more than anything in the world. They’re so good.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alongside those roasted sweet potatoes, there’s a tasty fish dish Rudolph loves to cook. “The most recent thing that I’ve really been enjoying making is a homemade version of a miso cod, but more like a salmon—almost like a teriyaki but with a sweet miso,” she said. “So the top is a bit caramel-y and it gets kind of like crispy and gooey.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re big fans of Rudolph’s miso salmon and sweet potato combination, especially since a large sweet potato adds six grams of fiber to your plate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949130/is-miso-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Miso&lt;/a&gt;, a soybean paste made by fermenting cooked soybeans, molded grain and salt, is also great for gut health.

What’s more, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; is a great source of healthy protein that’s rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and provides vitamins B12 and D, lots of minerals and plenty of antioxidants, so it’s also a great choice for a healthy dinner.

    &lt;p&gt;The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/doc/1432277049818/the-2025-protein-profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cargill&lt;/a&gt;. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals – they're all encouraging more protein after lifting," said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The protein boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, &lt;a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/us-proteins-and-protein-alternatives-market-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to Mintel&lt;/a&gt;, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights &lt;a href="https://www.innovamarketinsights.com/trends/protein-beverages-trends-global-market-overview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chains like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-protein-lattes-cold-foam-menu-september-29/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that "consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly," Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="https://rubyoaknutrition.com/about/christine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ruby Oak Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need," Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/protein-powders-shakes-lead-consumer-reports/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?EXTKEY=M5ANXO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary," Tieu said. "Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people — including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes — protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein is really needed in a diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein — this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to look for high quality sources," Ansari said. "So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong," she said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-protein foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis," Tieu suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some protein-rich foods include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meats, with options like chicken and turkey leaner than beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood, like tuna, salmon, shrimp and scallops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-media-health-trends-experts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs, or egg whites for less cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milk or soy milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tofu and tempeh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, lentils, chickpeas and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megan Meyer, a science communication consultant with a doctorate in nutritional immunology, said she aims to have both snacks and meals that include protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of my favorite protein-rich snacks include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, a handful of nuts, meat sticks and hard-boiled eggs," she said. "My go-to proteins for meals include lean meats like chicken breast, canned tuna, beans, lentils and tofu."&lt;/p&gt;

She starts her workout with a half hour of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-cardio-exercises-rcna14823" target="_blank"&gt;cardio&lt;/a&gt; — either the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/can-the-stair-climber-give-a-snatched-waist-rcna198583" target="_blank"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, treadmill, rowing machine or elliptical. Then she does a strength-training circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-deae9c" class="body-graf"&gt;While a lot of people like to &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-time-to-workout-rcna32755" target="_blank"&gt;work out in the morning&lt;/a&gt;, she prefers to go to the gym at night. “I find it very relaxing. I come home, take a shower, go to sleep and have a very restful night,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-44e26c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1269"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-04-166836.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-04-166836.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-04-166836.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-04-166836.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-04-166836.jpg" alt="Paulette Szalay weightloss"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;In her job as a teacher, Szalay could no longer take the stairs to her second-floor classroom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Paulette Szalay &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-666a4e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She eliminated some foods and found healthier ways to reintroduce them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bae81" class="body-graf"&gt;Szalay worked with a nutritionist for most of 2022, calculating the calories and carbs she needed to keep up her energy in the gym. Her initial daily targets were 1,200 calories, at least 50 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/dietitian-tip-fiber-high-protein-diet-rcna214084" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and low levels of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d6be" class="body-graf"&gt;“He went over the foods I like, what I should take out and what I added back in eventually,” she says. At first, she stopped eating carbs like pasta and bread, then later she modified the way she added them back in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77c6cc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Part of my Italian culture is that pasta would be your main dish,” she says. “Instead of having pasta four or five times a week, I would have a small portion as a side dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8035c9" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of frying, she now grills, steams, broils or uses an air fryer. She switched to vegan butter. “There were a lot of little changes in my food and how I prepared it,” she says. “You don’t realize it, but with just one tablespoon of regular butter, you’re adding all these extra fats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-156fd8" class="body-graf"&gt;She eats smaller meals throughout the day to make sure her blood-sugar levels stay even. In a typical day, she might have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-837822" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;A protein shake with a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter, plus supplements — collagen, MCT oil, vitamin D, vitamin C, a multivitamin, a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/food/10-good-prebiotic-foods-add-your-grocery-list-today-t216012" target="_blank"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; and a&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/probiotic-foods-rcna30830" target="_blank"&gt; probiotic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-morning snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Almonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch: &lt;/strong&gt;Salad with tuna or another type of fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Yogurt or a piece of fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner: &lt;/strong&gt;Grilled chicken, steamed vegetables and another side. On a gym day, that might be a half of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-many-calories-in-sweet-potato-rcna44374" target="_blank"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; or a baked potato, or a small serving of pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14c721" class="body-graf"&gt;“It works. I never feel hungry or like I lack energy. I’ve been healthy through the last three years,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-17602f"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1231"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-05-87827c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-05-87827c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-05-87827c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-05-87827c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/Paulette-Szalay-weightloss-mc-251014-05-87827c.jpg" alt="Paulette Szalay weightloss"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Szalay says her newfound confidence gives her a sense of purpose and she hopes to be an inspiration to other women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Paulette Szalay &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ddbe80" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She finds ways to overcome p&lt;/strong&gt;lateaus and setbacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98a565" class="body-graf"&gt;Szalay lost 10 pounds in her first week, but she knew that wasn’t sustainable. When she &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-break-weight-loss-plateau-walking-rcna92618" target="_blank"&gt;hit a plateau&lt;/a&gt;, she adjusted her exercise routine, changed the times that she ate and added in some carbs: “Believe it or not, putting back some of those carbs really helped &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/boost-metabolism-prevent-weight-gain-rcna19394" target="_blank"&gt;speed up my metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1041c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Nine months into her journey, she faced a serious health problem — an ocular stroke where she lost the vision in her left eye. But less than 24 hours later, her eyesight came back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b4daa" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was told that because I was living a healthy lifestyle, the cells regenerated and reversed the blindness. And they told me there was a good chance I would have another stroke within six months, but that has never happened,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-76a11f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She connects with support, and builds her confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03e03d" class="body-graf"&gt;Szalay weighs herself every week, on Saturday mornings: “I had a huge group text with family, friends and colleagues. That support system was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-saved-al-rokers-life-5-mindset-motivation-tips-rcna186157" target="_blank"&gt;key to motivating me&lt;/a&gt;. Every week I would get on the scale and tell them what I lost and what I weighed. I would get claps and hearts, and that’s what kept me going. Everyone needs a support system. You can’t do it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96f767" class="body-graf"&gt;As she started to lose the weight, her confidence grew. “I still relied on that support system, but it started to transfer over to me. I felt like I could do this. I’m confident now that I can do this on my own,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e1661" class="body-graf"&gt;That confidence gave her a sense of purpose. “I wake up and say, ‘What can I accomplish today?' There are goals I strive for. Before, I was waking up, doing the same routine, going to school and teaching. Now I feel like I have a purpose,” she says.”I would like to be an inspiration to others as that one woman on the beach was an inspiration to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 19:35:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOZ0Zkd1dYSWR1b0E1Z1NEZF93WV9mcjZidUhla2M3NlM4SnZpZlFDWUg0d2R0QXdISEJVS01kRTI2VGh0NFZ5U1E2SE5VUFhoc2ZXRE9VeEdCQS1mc3Z2YXllclVfaTZvaTBHNG9uQlJzV1RXQzlpWnBPcndsVThWVndkZm9Qc050akUyWWR4dXdSakhrczdROGt0SXVYRmJyM2JTWFBHVmJoZHZsWTVGdlZzQlZub1dwbVFn0gFUQVVfeXFMT3ExUDNRMURsU240dDQ0ME1mTFhHb1RrU09rQko3ZkJzc19HLXNRMzZha1hncExkN01xYXo4bzcwN2VvUHM3c1VDVU82NXQ3VW85R3hf</guid></item></channel></rss>
