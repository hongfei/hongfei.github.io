Almost immediately, I was overwhelmed with nausea. Next to me, my boyfriend was happily scrolling through news articles. He tried to show me a headline, but I was too busy staring out the window, breathing deeply and trying not to vomit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This happens basically any time I am in a moving vehicle that I am not personally piloting. It’s a little embarrassing. But I’m in good company: approximately one in three people are &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/motion-sickness/#frequency" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;considered&lt;/a&gt; “highly susceptible to motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/madeleine-aggeler","type":"Contributor","title":"Madeleine Aggeler","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=941aa4893ff7a0165c0d43241305e14e","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=237d41eba137320866c62c54d68129d8"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What exactly is motion sickness, and why do some people experience it so much more than others? We asked experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Motion sickness is a generic term that encompasses all sorts of travel sickness, including sea sickness, air sickness and car sickness, says Dr John Golding, professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But you don’t need to travel to experience its unpleasant symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, burping, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and blurred vision. When the Lumière brothers first screened a motion picture for the public in 1895, some people in the audience started feeling dizzy and sick, says Golding. This is known as “visually induced motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc137228-1ee0-4d21-bf7f-08a6dc5c4f4e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Athletes and fitness influencers use creatine, but what is it?

Your body uses visual stimuli, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/18/the-power-of-proprioception-how-to-improve-your-sixth-sense-and-become-healthier-and-happier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt; (the body’s ability to perceive itself in space) and the vestibular system (structures inside the inner ear that help you maintain a sense of balance) to sense where your body is and how it is moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Usually, these three mechanisms are in sync. But when one of them isn’t – say, you’re reading a static page in the car, but your vestibular system still senses that you’re moving – this sensory conflict confuses the brain. “This neurological tension is what triggers common symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting,” explains Dr Safia Debar, a general practitioner and executive health physician at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the case of the Lumière brothers’ first audiences, their vestibular systems and senses of proprioception told them they were still, but their eyes told them they were moving. Today, many people experience this sort of visually induced motion sickness when using virtual-reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-movements-cause-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What kinds of movements cause motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the most common misconceptions about motion sickness is that the strength of the movement determines the severity of the reaction, says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But people don’t tend to get motion sickness when they’re bouncing up and down on horseback; that is a “higher frequency” movement, says Golding. Slower-frequency movements, like the rocking of a ship at sea, or the swaying of a bus, are more likely to result in motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-some-people-experience-motion-sickness-more-than-others" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why do some people experience motion sickness more than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So why can one person read endlessly in a car while even a quick glimpse at a phone turns another person green?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of factors seem to influence one’s proneness to motion sickness, says Dr Behrang Keshavarz, senior scientist at the Kite Research Institute and professor in the department of psychology at Toronto Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One is age: motion sickness tends to peak in children between the ages of 8 and 12. “Adults are usually better than kids with motion sickness,” says Keshavarz. But that’s not true for everyone, he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Research suggests people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience motion sickness than those assigned male at birth, says Keshavarz, though no one’s quite sure why. Genetics may also play a role, says Golding, adding that studies indicate motion sickness might be 50-70% heritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some individuals may also be better at adapting to strange new motions than others, suggests Dr Thomas A Stoffregen, emeritus professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people are ‘naturally coordinated’ and can learn new motor skills quickly,” he says over email. “Others (like me) are klutzes and take forever to learn new movements.” The latter are more at risk for motion sickness, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I would like to see this printed on the little airplane vomit bags I so often end up breathing into during landings.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not about being delicate or anxious,” says Debar. “Some people are simply more sensitive to motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About half of novice astronauts get space sick during training, Golding adds. “They’re very fit, very highly motivated and not weak-willed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I nod.

Sit in the front seat of a car when you can, keep your eyes on the horizon, and avoid reading and screens, says Debar. She also notes that ginger has some natural anti-nausea effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pleasant music, fresh air, nice smells and a generally pleasant ambiance may be able to distract you, says Keshavarz. He also suggests car passengers copy the movements of the driver. Drivers rarely get motion sickness because they can anticipate the movements of the car and lean into turns, for example. “If you mimic what the driver does, that helps,” Keshavarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unfortunately, the most effective way to combat motion sickness is also the least pleasant: habituation. In other words, doing the activity over and over again until it doesn’t give you motion sickness anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is by far the most effective countermeasure,” says Golding, who used it to help desensitize Royal Air Force pilots to air sickness. “It doesn’t have side effects, but it’s very time consuming and can be stimulus specific,” he says – meaning that habituating to car sickness won’t necessarily help you with sea sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over-the-counter anti-nausea medication can be effective, experts say, but they often cause drowsiness. Transdermal patches such as Scopolamine are also helpful for up to three days, but can take six to 10 hours to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Timing is important for such medications, says Golding. Even pills might take 30 minutes to an hour to take effect. And you must take them before you start to feel sick, because once you start to experience motion sickness, your stomach goes into gastric stasis, meaning it is no longer emptying its contents into the gut. “That means you might have taken the pill, but it’s not going anywhere,” says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Finally, you can always “vote with your feet”, says Golding. “Avoid situations where you get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSHZLUldIT1puQXN1NFZ3OUdDdThPYjN4NjZGVE8wWF8yTk1xRXhNcEUxS3dyR3M3ZE91V0RScDF6WTdHQ1JXeWxqSGctdUVHdTJvN0JYOUpCWXNuOFZ6MzZ0bUtZWVZFVkx0VmZIZXdhSkZfbEpCWnd6RndhRGJBVFNR</guid></item><item><title>重新布线记忆：像人脑一样学习的新模型-神经科学新闻 | Rewiring Memory: A New Model That Learns Like a Human Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9rMm9qTXRTNENLbVNxZWtuOGZNWjZQeWdXRjVOeDRSWk81NWwySFlmc3k1TnBMNGZNaW5KMjF0MFBManVPN19COFlWdWlILWpkUzNTSVpobS1KanJqeUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new memory model called Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) offers a more human-like explanation for how external stimuli help us retrieve memories, building on the foundations of the classic Hopfield network. Unlike traditional models, which assume memory recall happens from a fixed starting point, the IDP framework describes how stimuli reshape the brain’s “energy landscape” in real time to guide memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic approach better reflects how we remember things in real life, like recognizing a cat from just its tail. The model is also robust to noise, filtering out weak memories in favor of stable, meaningful ones, offering insights for future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Memory Retrieval:&lt;/strong&gt; The IDP model suggests that external stimuli reshape the neural landscape as memories are retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise-Resilient Design:&lt;/strong&gt; It uses environmental “noise” to filter out unstable memories, improving robustness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; This model could inspire more memory-capable AI systems that go beyond static inputs and mimic human associative recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the first notes of an old, beloved song. Can you name that tune? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can, congratulations — it’s a triumph of your associative memory, in which one piece of information (the first few notes) triggers the memory of the entire pattern (the song), without you actually having to hear the rest of the song again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use this handy neural mechanism to learn, remember, solve problems and generally navigate our reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110130"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human.jpg" alt="This shows a brain made of computer chips." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-memory-neuroscience-human-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Instead of applying the two-step algorithmic memory retrieval on the rather static energy landscape of the original Hopfield network model, the researchers describe a dynamic, input-driven mechanism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a network effect,” said UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering professor Francesco Bullo, explaining that associative memories aren’t stored in single brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory storage and memory retrieval are dynamic processes that occur over entire networks of neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982 physicist John Hopfield translated this theoretical neuroscience concept into the artificial intelligence realm, with the formulation of the Hopfield network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, not only did he provide a mathematical framework for understanding memory storage and retrieval in the human brain, he also developed one of the first recurrent artificial neural networks — the Hopfield network — known for its ability to retrieve complete patterns from noisy or incomplete inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopfield won the Nobel Prize for his work in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to Bullo and collaborators Simone Betteti, Giacomo Baggio and Sandro Zampieri at the University of Padua in Italy, the traditional Hopfield network model is powerful, but it doesn’t tell the full story of how new information guides memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably,” they say in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, “the role of external inputs has largely been unexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest a model of memory retrieval they say is more descriptive of how we experience memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The modern version of machine learning systems, these large language models — they don’t really model memories,” Bullo explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You put in a prompt and you get an output. But it’s not the same way in which we understand and handle memories in the animal world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While LLMs can return responses that can sound convincingly intelligent, drawing upon the patterns of the language they are fed, they still lack the underlying reasoning and experience of the physical real world that animals have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way in which we experience the world is something that is more continuous and less start-and-reset,” said Betteti, lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the treatments on the Hopfield model tended to treat the brain as if it was a computer, he added, with a very mechanistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, since we are working on a memory model, we want to start with a human perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main question inspiring the theorists was: As we experience the world that surrounds us, how do the signals we receive enable us to retrieve memories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hopfield envisioned, it helps to conceptualize memory retrieval in terms of an energy landscape, in which the valleys are energy minima that represent memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory retrieval is like exploring this landscape; recognition is when you fall into one of the valleys. Your starting position in the landscape is your initial condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you see a cat’s tail,” Bullo said. “Not the entire cat, but just the tail. An associative memory system should be able to recover the memory of the entire cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the traditional Hopfield model, the cat’s tail (stimulus) is enough to put you closest to the valley labeled “cat,” he explained, treating the stimulus as an initial condition. But how did you get to that spot in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The classic Hopfield model does not carefully explain how seeing the tail of the cat puts you in the right place to fall down the hill and reach the energy minimum,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you move around in the space of neural activity where you are storing these memories? It’s a little bit unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) model aims to address this lack of clarity with a mechanism that gradually integrates past and new information, guiding the memory retrieval process to the correct memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of applying the two-step algorithmic memory retrieval on the rather static energy landscape of the original Hopfield network model, the researchers describe a dynamic, input-driven mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We advocate for the idea that as the stimulus from the external world is received (e.g., the image of the cat tail), it changes the energy landscape at the same time,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The stimulus simplifies the energy landscape so that no matter what your initial position, you will roll down to the correct memory of the cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers say, the IDP model is robust to noise — situations where the input is vague, ambiguous, or partially obscured — and in fact uses the noise as a means to filter out less stable memories (the shallower valleys of this energy landscape) in favor of the more stable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We start with the fact that when you’re gazing at a scene your gaze shifts in between the different components of the scene,” Betteti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So at every instant in time you choose what you want to focus on but you have a lot of noise around.” Once you lock into the input to focus on, the network adjusts itself to prioritize it, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing what stimulus to focus on, a.k.a. attention, is also the main mechanism behind another neural network architecture, the transformer, which has become the heart of large language models like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the IDP model the researchers propose “starts from a very different initial point with a different aim,” Bullo said, there’s a lot of potential for the model to be helpful in designing future machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a connection between the two, and the paper describes it,” Bullo said. “It is not the main focus of the paper, but there is this wonderful hope that these associative memory systems and large language models may be reconciled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#592a36373038773f3c2b3738373d3c23192c3a2a3b773c3d2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sonia Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsb.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sonia Fernandez – UC Santa Barbara&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu6991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/a&gt;” by Francesco Bullo et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hopfield model provides a mathematical framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model has inspired decades of research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the role of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying mixed inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, we embed both the classic and the proposed model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to examine the association between two vitamin D biomarkers (25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and vitamin D-binding protein [DBP], and their related genetic correlates) and the risk of six mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a population-based, case-cohort sample of all individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005. Using Danish health registers with follow-up to Dec 31, 2012, we identified individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, ASD, and anorexia nervosa based on ICD-10 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a random subcohort from the general population was selected. Based on neonatal dried blood spots, we measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP. Our primary analyses were based on hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI and absolute risks for the six mental disorders according to measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As secondary analyses, we examined the association between genetic predictors of 25(OH)D and DBP, and the six mental disorders, and Mendelian randomisation analyses based on published summary statistics for 25(OH)D, DBP, and the six mental disorders. People with lived experience contributed to the development of the guiding hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the total population from the iPSYCH2012 design (n=88 764), which included individuals who developed the six mental disorders, major depressive disorder (n=24 240), bipolar disorder (n=1928), schizophrenia (n=3540), ADHD (n=18 726), ASD (n=16 146), anorexia nervosa (n=3643), and the randomly sampled subcohort (n=30 000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who met a range of inclusion criteria (eg, measured 25[OH]D, DBP or genotype, and predominantly European ancestry), we measured 25(OH)D or DBP in 71 793 individuals (38 118 [53·1%] male and 33 675 [46·9%] female); 65 952 had 25(OH)D and 66 797 the DBP measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant inverse relationships were found between 25(OH)D and schizophrenia (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·78–0·86), ASD (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·90–0·96), and ADHD (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·86–0·92). A significant inverse relationship was found between DBP and schizophrenia (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·80–0·88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on polygenic risk scores, higher concentrations of 25(OH)D (adjusted for DBP) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of both ASD and schizophrenia. Analyses based on Mendelian randomisation provided support for a causal association between both lower 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations and an increased risk of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergent evidence finds that neonatal vitamin D status is associated with an altered risk of mental disorders. Our study supports the hypothesis that optimising neonatal vitamin D status might reduce the incidence of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 14:33:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE52MEhoeVB1MnpvQWQ3b2tBeHpRSmtEN0hRcGhUdWhCb1l0aEVRT2lnTkg3MVZUWHpJSTI3RjJ1ZjhoM2dMVGhwcWJlLWQtMlRKWlZrV3pnc01JTUptTmt4TlB4SVRsYWJmTlE</guid></item><item><title>吃这1种食物可以促进运动后的肌肉恢复—而不是蛋白质- TODAY.com | Eat This 1 Food To Boost Muscle Recovery After Exercise — And It's Not Protein - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPYTM1MEZEelhGTWt3bjNHLW1wNjd5RjJ3bGV6bDM0SXhtLVp4UDA5Ti1Sa3BjSVNybXJuM0JHZ09lNWEtQks3OUd0WW5XZ041eXN0TEl5NDFfZ2FDbjY4dzdTeUVWQ1dzdXVoU0FBME1NZ3ZvdHNndGctajVZVTR3LS01LW1FVTF5QmZmeE5WcDE3T1VRMk03ODY4YjnSAVRBVV95cUxPZHlvRC04Z1dOeVp1eVlfTWZudEhScll4bXZUYjRQaml4WFlYdHdOT1NXXzZxUUNTcVQxbEE3MHhxMEttdHc0WUM1WG0yMV9zY0FUSXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Lagging in energy a little bit after a workout isn't uncommon, nor is feeling a little lethargic at the gym when you exercised rigorously the day before. But you don't have to feel this way, says registered dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are focused on getting enough protein before and after working out because they've likely heard it's crucial for muscle recovery, but it turns out that another macronutrient is just as vital, advises Rizzo, who specializes in sports nutrition. The macronutrient in question is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're thinking that her advice means you need to load up on bread, pasta or rice after every workout to get the muscle-boosting, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat carbs and protein together to boost muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These days it feels like the wellness world is all about protein, but carbs are just as important for staying energized and fit. That's why Rizzo recommends eating carbs and protein together after working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Carbohydrates are the main energy source for exercise," Rizzo explains. "The body actually stores carbs in the muscles and liver to serve as the primary energy source for activity. This stored form of carbs is called glycogen, and replacing glycogen after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. If you don’t replace glycogen, you may feel fatigued later in the day and during you next workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019055/#sec12" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that activities like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling or resistance training utilize glycogen and require carbohydrate replacement, either through post-exercise recovery meal or increasing carbs throughout the day,” Rizzo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although carbohydrates have been demonized by wellness movements of the past, they have a lot of benefits,&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank"&gt; according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They are a primary energy source for the body and often provide fiber, important for gut health and preventing chronic disease. And certain whole grains, fruits and veggies can reduce risk of weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Without carbs, your muscles may not recover adequately after working out, the risks of include injury and decreased performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Incorporating carbs after a workout doesn’t need to be complicated, Rizzo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rather than having a protein shake after a workout, make a smoothie with a protein source, like yogurt or soy milk, and add a handful of fruit.

They report that around 25% of older adults are socially isolated and 5%-15% of adolescents are lonely. But a variety of research – including our own – suggests reading may be a much better solution than chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110118"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a person reading and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, can slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human interaction is no doubt hugely important. In a study we published in 2023, we found that it only takes around five close friends &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for children and adolescents to thrive&lt;/a&gt;, giving them better brain structure, cognition, academic performance and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having fewer than five close friends may not provide enough social contact. But larger numbers are less likely to be close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilemma of technology frequently means that despite some people having vast numbers of friends on social media, they are not close friends and so do not provide the social support needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, chatbots may not provide the type of face-to-face social interaction that people need to flourish. During the pandemic lockdowns, a study found that face-to-face communication was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10191089/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;far more beneficial&lt;/a&gt; for mental health than digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can reading help us to feel less lonely and have better wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey from The Queen’s Reading Room, the charity and book club of Queen Camilla, and other surveys, have found that reading fiction and other books significantly reduces feelings of loneliness and improves wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another charity, The Reader, conducted a survey of approximately 2,000 participants and found that this was especially true among young adults. Fifty-nine percent of those aged 18-34 said reading made them feel more connected to others and 56% felt less alone during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another survey, in conjunction with the University of Liverpool, of over 4,000 participants found that reading offers powerful benefits, serving as a top method for reducing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants reported that reading encouraged personal growth, such as improving health, picking up hobbies and boosting empathy, with 64% of readers having a better understanding others’ feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reading and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, scientific research looking at book clubs and shared reading back this up, finding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316632/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;notable emotional and social benefits&lt;/a&gt; of reading. For example, students reported greater connection (42.9%) to others, deeper understanding of others’ experiences and beliefs (61.2%) and reduced loneliness (14.3%) as a result of reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys above all rely on people reporting how they feel, rather than an objective measure. But there are also findings from objective measures of the brain, including neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 11 intervention studies showed that shared reading among older adults &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/40/2/daaf036/8110077?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improved wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and helped alleviate loneliness and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way in which reading may help reduce loneliness is by enhancing our social cognition, which is the ability to understand and connect with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/2/215/2375122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt; of young adults found that reading fiction, particularly passages with social content, activated areas of the brain involved in social behaviour and emotional understanding, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brain region was also linked to the stronger social cognition seen in frequent fiction readers, suggesting a neural pathway through which reading fosters greater social connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, reading may also reduce the risk of dementia. One study of 469 people aged 75 and over, with no dementia at baseline, were followed up for 5.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among leisure activities such as playing board games, playing musical instruments and dancing, reading was associated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with a 35% reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/abs/10.1212/01.wnl.0000192165.99963.2a?casa_token=Ihv-keCL5qcAAAAA%3AuPNBvFyPFqvcxqrGrC3dwdbh-qZGPWIEGh6yxq9WVMekTDULJx-_N3u4WxYMOlvUCKT7VSwP5oFTndLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851541/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our own research also showed the benefits of reading for pleasure early in life. In a large sample of over 10,000 children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/earlyinitiated-childhood-reading-for-pleasure-associations-with-better-cognitive-performance-mental-wellbeing-and-brain-structure-in-young-adolescence/03FB342223A3896DB8C39F171659AE33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;we found that&lt;/a&gt; those children who read for pleasure early in life had better brain structure, cognition, academic achievement, longer sleep duration and better mental health – including lower symptoms of inattention, stress and depression – when adolescents. Importantly, they also had less screen time and better social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while AI and chatbots can enhance our lives in many ways, they are not a solution to everything. We know that while technology has many benefits, it has also produced many unforeseen problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s solve problems of loneliness and social isolation through reading and book clubs. Reading is also a great way to improve brain structure, cognition and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this reading and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/barbara-jacquelyn-sahakian-947460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Jacquelyn Sahakian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/christelle-langley-948259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christelle Langley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Jacquelyn Sahakian and Christelle Langley – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256613/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:34:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5JODVDcVhuMEFHbXFXRzY1akxrMnlQYUxPNU9TMzFFZy1HM0Z0S0tXLVR5T25YanBmUEpEZjd5eXFOUmIwSl9zOUp5RUY2UmFmSW9sUWNxSmVHUUZvMTZQM0FiVUh0V3hMb3J2ckYwSQ</guid></item><item><title>治疗如何重新连接大脑以缓解慢性疼痛-神经科学新闻 | How Therapy Rewires the Brain to Ease Chronic Pain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE81ajJOM0I5MjJ5MEdlM2xHdTVpWXFoNTlSR2FTbWZ1Zl9HSmVwQmp6LXJpNjBtWTlvbzBTQ3p5Yk5tNEppcmhVYzM1QjVpWEVJYzhsNjZzd0hKT0RfVVpEV2VydzI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Chronic pain affects one in five adults, and medication alone doesn’t always offer relief. A new review reveals that psychological treatments—particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—can reduce pain through measurable changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review of multiple studies found that therapy shifts brain network activity, helping people loosen harmful thought patterns and reduce emotional stress linked to pain. These brain-based changes are associated with less pain and improved quality of life, offering new hope for accessible, non-drug treatments like CBT or even apps based on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychological therapy alters brain networks tied to pain and emotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBT Works:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most supported and effective method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Apps may offer scalable access to therapy-based pain relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back pain, migraines, arthritis, long-term concussion symptoms, complications following cancer treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the conditions linked to chronic pain, which affects one in five adults—and for which medication is not always the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110114"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When we are in this state, a specific network in the brain known as the default mode network is active. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new review study offers insight into how specific types of psychological treatment can help relieve this pain— through physical changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research article was published today in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, one of the world’s leading medical journals. The study is led by Professor Lene Vase from the Department of Psychology at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, people go to the doctor when they are in pain, and the doctor usually prescribes medication to ease the pain. But medication doesn’t always work well for chronic pain, and many doctors are looking for other treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychological treatment is one alternative, and we are now one step closer to understanding exactly how it works,” says Lene Vase, who in addition to being a professor of psychology also holds a doctorate in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not new that psychological treatment can relieve pain. What is new is the detailed scientific explanation behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have shown that patients experience less pain after psychological treatment. But is this just a feeling? Does the mental processing simply distract us and help us cope with the pain? Or do physical changes in the body actually occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article published today, Lene Vase and her colleagues review a number of previous studies. Each study on its own is too small and inconclusive to draw firm conclusions about physical changes in patients. However, when the researchers analyse them together, a clear pattern emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more studies before we can pinpoint with scientific certainty exactly which elements of psychological therapy affect the brain, and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the analysis we’re publishing today provides clear indications of which specific elements of psychological treatment are most important, and how they are associated with changes in the way the brain and spinal cord process pain,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the brain is on autopilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vase highlights cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a method that shows clear effects. This type of therapy focuses, among other things, on changing automatic thought patterns—the thoughts and feelings that occur when we are not actively thinking, and the brain is on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we are in this state, a specific network in the brain known as the default mode network is active. This network interacts with other brain networks which are directly linked to pain and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, researchers can see—put simply—that activity in these networks changes when people shift their thought patterns and emotions through therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re in pain, it can easily take over your life. You might worry about how it will affect your job or your family, and you might avoid doing things you used to enjoy. If you are able to loosen these thoughts and emotions and return to living life as normally as possible, we can see that this is linked to visible changes in the brain, less pain and improved quality of life,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try an app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor believes this new knowledge can be used actively by psychologists, doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, what we know most about is the effect of sitting face to face with a psychologist, but unfortunately, there aren’t enough psychologists to treat everyone who suffers from pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, it seems that doctors, physiotherapists and nurses can also help guide patients towards pain-relieving ways of thinking. And some people may even be able to help themselves—perhaps by using an app,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already more than 500 apps for psychological pain relief, the researchers write in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. But their effectiveness hasn’t yet been fully documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we wait for solid scientific evidence, I would personally choose an app based on cognitive behavioural therapy,” says Professor Lene Vase from the Department of Psychology at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent Research Fund Denmark, Lundbeck Foundation, Aarhus University Research Foundation, National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health (USA), Medical Research Council (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Research (UK), The MayDay Foundation, Versus Arthritis, Arthritis Research and Southwood Family Donation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict of interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lene Vase has received fees for courses on pain and placebo and has served on the scientific programme committee for the World Congress of Pain.

CCMs are abnormal clusters of blood vessels in the brain that can cause serious symptoms, often treated with risky surgery or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preclinical studies, the ultrasound-microbubble method stopped 94% of lesion growth without drugs, surgery, or radiation. This breakthrough could transform treatment for patients with familial CCMs and other high-risk cases, with clinical trials on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug-Free Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused ultrasound with microbubbles stabilized CCMs without medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressive Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Growth halted in 94% of brain lesions in preclinical models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgical Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt; The approach may offer a safer, incision-free option for hard-to-reach CCMs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new, incision-free technique developed at UVA Health to treat debilitating brain lesions called cerebral cavernous malformations, or cavernomas, has shown great promise in early testing, halting the growth of the lesions almost entirely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach could represent a paradigm shift in how the malformations, commonly called CCMs, are treated, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110110"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/focused-ultrasound-brain-lesions-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;For example, traditional brain surgery comes with the risks of the surgery itself and also the possibility that the removed cavernomas could regrow. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique uses tiny, gas-filled “microbubbles” propelled by focused sound waves to open the brain’s protective barrier and stunt the growth of the malformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a clear example of serendipity in science. We were looking for something else – performing long-term safety studies of focused ultrasound as a tool for drug and gene delivery to CCMs – when we noticed that CCMs exposed to just focused ultrasound with microbubbles were being stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the initial observations, we spent years doing experiments to confirm the effect was real and reproducible,” said researcher Richard J. Price, PhD, co-director of UVA Health’s Focused Ultrasound Cancer Immunotherapy Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because the focused ultrasound treatment is relatively simple and non-invasive and the necessary clinical devices are becoming more common, if proven safe in clinical trials, I am hopeful it could eventually become a real treatment option.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Cavernomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavernomas are clusters of overgrown blood vessels that can sprout like weeds in the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the body. Most cases cause no symptoms, but they can, in some instances, cause headaches, seizures, muscle weakness and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment options for patients include brain surgery, often used when the CCM is at risk of causing a dangerous brain bleed, or stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses radiation to destroy CCMs that are difficult or impossible for a surgeon to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVA’s new approach could offer an alternative that avoids unwanted side effects associated with brain surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery, Price says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, traditional brain surgery comes with the risks of the surgery itself and also the possibility that the removed cavernomas could regrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price and his collaborators were shocked at how well their microbubble treatment performed in lab tests. One month after treatment, the approach had halted the growth of 94% of CCMs in lab mice. During this same time, untreated CCMs grew seven-fold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that really stands out is the magnitude of the effect. The mouse models of CCM are much more severe than human CCMs. Mouse CCMs grow exponentially. Yet despite their aggressive nature, CCMs in mice still respond completely to treatment,” said Price, of UVA’s Department of Biomedical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some studies, we even saw that brain tissue exposed to focused ultrasound with microbubbles was less inclined to harbor new CCMs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If translated to humans, this prophylactic effect could open the door to treatments for so-called ‘familial’ patients who are genetically predisposed to acquiring multiple new CCMs throughout their lifespan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, simulated treatment plans for patients with CCMs (patients who have received stereotactic radiosurgery) revealed that the approach is already viable with existing technology, though clinical trials will be needed before the federal Food and Drug Administration would consider making it available for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable aspect of the approach is that it doesn’t involve the use of any drugs. Scientists at UVA and elsewhere have been exploring the potential of focused ultrasound to briefly breach the blood-brain barrier – the brain’s natural defenses – to allow the targeted delivery of medications for Alzheimer’s and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in both Alzheimer’s and now cavernomas, the use of the sound-propelled microbubbles appears to have dramatic benefits even without drugs – benefits scientists can’t fully explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promising Alzheimer’s results have already led to the launch of several clinical trials testing the approach in patients. Price hopes UVA’s pioneering research will prompt the launch of similar trials soon for CCMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are very interested in understanding what is in the ‘black box’ that somehow connects focused ultrasound to the cessation of mutant cell expansion in the CCMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are also returning to our original ideas about drug and gene delivery to CCMs. Since the baseline effect stabilizes the lesions, perhaps we can now think of eradicating them entirely with additional therapies,” Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of discovery is largely an outcome of the investments UVA has made in focused ultrasound technology over the years. There are few other institutions in the world with the critical mass of expertise and infrastructure to allow new discoveries like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Price and his collaborator Petr Tvrdik, PhD, recently received more than $3 million from the National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute to support their ongoing CCM research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price and his collaborators have described their CCM results in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Delaney G.

&lt;p&gt;Australia is drifting northward at a rate of about &lt;strong&gt;7 centimeters (just under 3 inches)&lt;/strong&gt; per year, making it the fastest-moving &lt;strong&gt;continent&lt;/strong&gt; on the planet. This movement is caused by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indo-Australian tectonic plate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which carries not only &lt;strong&gt;mainland Australia&lt;/strong&gt; but also&lt;strong&gt; Tasmania&lt;/strong&gt;, parts of &lt;strong&gt;New Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt;, and regions of the Indian Ocean basin. By comparison, most continents move at an average rate of about 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) per year. This speed means Australia shifts as quickly as human hair and fingernails grow, highlighting how dynamic the &lt;strong&gt;Earth’s surface&lt;/strong&gt; truly is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind Tectonic Shifts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tectonic shift refers to the movement of the &lt;strong&gt;plates&lt;/strong&gt; that make up Earth’s crust. The planet’s surface is divided into roughly a dozen major and several minor plates, which fit together like pieces of a cracked shell. These plates rest on the hot, molten &lt;strong&gt;mantle&lt;/strong&gt; beneath, and their movement is driven by heat generated from radioactive processes deep inside the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This movement causes plates to collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, reshaping the planet’s surface over millions of years. According to the&lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tectonics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (&lt;strong&gt;NOAA&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the average movement of continents is about &lt;strong&gt;1.5 centimeters per year&lt;/strong&gt;, but certain areas like coastal California experience faster motion, explaining their frequent &lt;strong&gt;earthquakes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Australia’s Movement Affects Mapping and Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Australia’s steady movement has practical implications for mapping and &lt;strong&gt;location-based technology&lt;/strong&gt;. The country used coordinates based on the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (&lt;strong&gt;GDA94&lt;/strong&gt;), but by 2017, this system had become out of alignment with the continent’s actual position by approximately 1.6 meters (5.2 feet). To address this, the Australian government introduced the Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (&lt;strong&gt;GDA2020&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan announced that “Australia’s coordinates have officially moved 1.8 metres northeast,” emphasizing the importance of updating the reference frame. This change enhances the accuracy of location data used in industries such as surveying, mobile location services, and emerging intelligent transport systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Geoscience Australia’s Role in Updating the Geodetic Framework&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geoscience Australia has played a leading role in implementing the &lt;strong&gt;GDA2020&lt;/strong&gt; update. Nick Brown, the project leader for GDA2020 at&lt;a href="https://www.ga.gov.au/news/news-archive/australia-officially-moves-1.8-metres-northeast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Geoscience Australia&lt;/a&gt;, explained that the updated coordinates reflect the projected position of the Australian continent as of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support this transition, Geoscience Australia and the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (&lt;strong&gt;ICSM&lt;/strong&gt;) have developed technical manuals, online software tools like AUSPOS and AUSGeoid2020, and a web service to convert spatial data from the old GDA94 system to the new GDA2020 standard. These resources aim to help government agencies and spatial organizations update their data and maintain accurate mapping and positioning services across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Australia’s continuous northward drift serves as a clear example of how Earth’s surface is in constant motion, requiring ongoing adjustments in scientific measurement and &lt;strong&gt;technology&lt;/strong&gt; to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Professor Bethany Barone Gibbs, an expert in &lt;span&gt;epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at West Virginia University, said the new study showed the importance of even small bursts of activity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Replacing sedentary time with light intensity activities, like tidying up the house or strolling at a slow pace, was nearly as beneficial as moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities, like biking or doing aerobics,' she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;These findings suggest sitting less and doing anything else—like taking a walk, cooking, playing with your dog or gardening—will help you stay healthier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise physiologist and lead author of the study Keith Diaz, of the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, added: 'Our study indicates that one doesn’t have to start running marathons after a cardiovascular event to see benefits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sitting less and moving or sleeping a little more can make a real difference.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise, of any kind, is known to help keep the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart is a muscle and, just like those in your arms and legs, it gets stronger with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs (pictured) are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stronger heart can pump blood around the body more efficiently keeping cholesterol and blood pressure low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Diaz added the researchers had been particularly surprised that replacing sitting with sleeping would have such an impact on health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sleep is a restorative behaviour that helps the body and mind recover, which is especially important after a serious health event,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises that adults should get at least seven to nine hours of sleep per night for optimum health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.124.011644"&gt;Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, the team analysed data from 609 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All patients had attended Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City with symptoms of a heart attack, such as chest pain, between 2016 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had an average of 62 and were split almost evenly in terms of sex.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon discharge, patients were given a watch which tracked their activity levels for the following 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists then followed up with the patients a year after they had first reported symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the conclusion of the study nearly one in 10 patients (50) had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors didn't detail exactly what condition the deceased patients had died from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the most active participants found they, on average, undertook 144-minutes of light physical activity, like walking, 25 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity, like jogging, had eight-and-half hours of sleep and spent nearly 12 hours sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, the least active patients spent nearly 16 hours sedentary, only spending 82 minutes doing light physical activity, less than three minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity and only slept about six-and-a-half hours on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study had several limitations which the authors acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, demographic data such as patients' wealth or where they lived was not collected— and this could have influenced their survival outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Secondly, the watches were only worn for about 30 days meaning that changes to physical activity levels among participants after this time would not have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease is one of Britain's biggest killers, killing about 160,000 people a year, with the American death toll about five times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures estimate that around 1.4million people in the UK have previously had a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help protect themselves from health problems like heart attacks the NHS advises the public to aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate activity includes activities like a brisk walk or gardening whereas vigorous includes those like riding a bike or swimming.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:37:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Ozempic are some of the most in-demand drugs on the market - prescribed for everything from diabetes to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;But a growing number of patients claim Ozempic can come with a terrifying side effect: Irreversible vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Edward Fanelli, a former contractor from Freehold, New Jersey, said he was prescribed Ozempic to manage his diabetes, but within months, his vision went dark - forcing him to give up his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"Not even six to eight months later, I, out of nowhere, I could not see out of my right eye," he says. "I couldn't take a chance do the contracting work, worried about cutting my fingers off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Fanelli says he was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a sudden on-set condition with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He is the first patient in New Jersey to file a lawsuit in state court against the makers of Ozempic, claiming he was never warned the blockbuster drug could lead to irreversible vision loss.

	"If they would have told me a chance I could lose my vision, I would not have taken it. Don't care - weight loss would have done on my own," he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Island attorney Jason Goldstein represents more than a dozen clients, including Fanelli, in lawsuits that center on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the active ingredient in Ozempic and similar drugs, which has now been linked in medical literature to NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein claims the drugmakers failed to warn patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"That's the crux of this case, people are not warned about this. What did the doctor know? What did the patient know? No one knew," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic, says the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged and that NAION is not an adverse drug reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein says he will be pushing for updated warning labels and compensation so future patients don't find themselves negatively impacted by a drug they thought would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Novo Nordisk spokesperson released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus® and Wegovy®) as per the approved labels. After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Novo Nordisk, on its part, has conducted an analysis across randomized controlled clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including a blinded ophthalmologist evaluation to confirm NAION diagnoses. These data do not suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use and NAION events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - The Bronx</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:17:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOeXBDSXUtQjFycjF6UHFjUmJUTDhrN1FZZWNNT2haeVZGSE5zdGNQQlNMeDVSV1ZyUmJkYkd2WWhrNXcyeGJMT2FZbEN4TTB4MXlrODRUUmQ0NV9QTG9iUW05TjRMSDMxclcxbGZvUUtJaUJvMFRXUjIyTnFUWWgwaVk5dGxESk5VaGZGOXd5MXpjUm5FYlNvTF9aeVRVZHdlM09QeXBBMA</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现焦虑青年的注意力相关大脑连接改变- PsyPost | Scientists finds altered attention-related brain connectivity in youth with anxiety - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQTkpMakxGZng2T1RhMVZVUWdJWmdFNHNqUEUzZlRqdy1xSjl2VDBQbGdiZWk5SDBJOTE5N1VraTc3LTczNGRXTTlSaXpJUW5kYzl6ZDNxVGFMOC1JSGlfbnFubk9seTU3blpDbVVXcEFIYkVRU3d4REo5X0V2cWd3VmcyYzVveDRiRHFNMHNuMk9jQ1hBeHFsZHpoX2FXRTk1RzFWWTE0NGJpLUt5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245190222500062X" target="_blank"&gt;Psychophysiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; highlights how brain connectivity patterns differ in children and adolescents diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Researchers found that young people with this condition showed stronger connectivity within a specific brain network that helps detect unexpected events. This heightened connection appeared to fade in those who recovered from the disorder over time, suggesting a potential brain-based marker linked to anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder often begins during childhood or adolescence and is marked by persistent, uncontrollable worry across many areas of life. It can interfere with academic, social, and emotional development and is associated with a greater risk for other mental health challenges later on. Despite its early onset, little is known about how this condition may affect the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generalized anxiety disorder emerges in childhood or adolescence for some individuals, but lot of what we know about brain connectivity comes from adult studies,” said study authors Sam A. Sievertsen of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and Jennifer Forsyth of the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to fill that gap by exploring how the brains of youth with generalized anxiety disorder differ in terms of functional connectivity. This refers to how brain regions communicate with each other while the person is at rest. Using brain imaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study—a large, ongoing project following nearly 12,000 youth across the United States—the researchers compared connectivity patterns in children with generalized anxiety disorder to those without any psychiatric diagnoses. They also looked at whether these patterns changed as the children’s symptoms changed over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ABCD Study offered us a unique opportunity to look at thousands of youth and assess how large-scale brain networks differ in those who meet criteria for Generalized anxiety disorder at this earlier age from those who do not,” the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on six large-scale brain networks known to be involved in attention, emotion, and self-awareness, as well as six subcortical regions deep in the brain that play important roles in motivation, memory, and emotional processing. They analyzed resting-state brain scans from 164 youth who had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and compared them to scans from over 3,000 youth without any diagnosed mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a statistical model to examine how strongly brain areas within each network were connected and how these networks communicated with the subcortical regions. They also tested whether these connectivity patterns were different in youth with other conditions that often co-occur with generalized anxiety, such as depression or other anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest findings was that youth with generalized anxiety disorder had slightly stronger connectivity within the brain’s ventral attention network. This network is involved in automatically redirecting attention to sudden or important changes in the environment. Stronger connectivity in this network may reflect a heightened sensitivity to potentially threatening or unexpected events—a feature often reported by individuals with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were struck by the ventral attention network being the signal most specific to youth with generalized anxiety disorder in our study,” Sievertsen and Forsyth told PsyPost. “There were other subcortical region-cortical network connectivity differences in generalized anxiety disorder, but they were less pronounced and less unique to generalized anxiety disorder compared to other diagnoses like depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this connectivity difference appeared to change with the clinical course of the disorder. Among youth who no longer met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder two years later, the heightened ventral attention network connectivity was reduced. In contrast, those who continued to meet criteria for the disorder showed no significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hyperconnectivity went away in youth when their anxiety remitted, implying this pattern shifts with generalized anxiety disorder symptoms,” the researchers said. “The effects we saw were modest and based on observational data, so we can’t say that this causes or is caused by generalized anxiety disorder – but it suggests that the strength of this network’s connectivity is associated with it and should be examined further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this core finding, the researchers also observed stronger connectivity between certain cortical networks and subcortical regions in youth with generalized anxiety disorder. These included the amygdala, which plays a key role in processing emotional stimuli; the caudate and putamen, which are involved in goal-directed behavior and reward processing; and parts of the brain associated with monitoring internal states and maintaining alertness. These connections were generally stronger in the anxiety group compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all connectivity differences were specific to generalized anxiety disorder. In some cases, the same connectivity patterns were seen in youth with other conditions, such as depression or separation anxiety. For example, stronger connections between the brain’s control network and the caudate or amygdala were found in multiple groups. This suggests that while some brain changes may be linked to generalized anxiety disorder in particular, others may reflect broader alterations related to mood or anxiety symptoms more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether these brain differences were associated with the severity of anxiety symptoms, based on parent and youth reports. They found no strong associations between connectivity measures and symptom severity scores. This may suggest that these brain differences are more closely tied to diagnostic status than to specific levels of worry or fear. Alternatively, it could reflect limitations in how symptom severity was measured or the complexity of linking brain patterns with fluctuating emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was not designed to test treatment effects directly, but most children with generalized anxiety disorder had received some form of mental health care by the two-year follow-up. The researchers did not find strong links between treatment history and brain connectivity changes, though they note that more detailed information about the type and duration of therapy or medication would be needed to better assess this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work has some limitations to consider. “The effect sizes in our study were modest and the clinical groups were still relatively small, so these differences should not be considered diagnostic or biomarkers by any means,” Sievertsen and Forsyth explained. “We also relied on parent-reported diagnoses because they best match clinician interviews at this age, which was helpful, but future work would benefit from using multi-informant or clinician assessments and more than two time points of data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this study represents one of the largest efforts to map brain connectivity differences in children with generalized anxiety disorder. Its findings suggest that stronger connections in the ventral attention network may play a role in the condition’s symptoms and could be explored as a potential biomarker in future research. Long-term, the researchers hope to investigate whether this pattern can help predict who develops anxiety, who recovers, and who responds best to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key area of study now is to investigate whether the stronger connectivity we observed really forecasts who is experiencing generalized anxiety disorder, who recovers, or who benefits most from therapy – questions that growing longitudinal datasets and other clinical cohorts are poised to help test,” Sievertsen and Forsyth told PsyPost. “Future studies could pair resting scans with tasks designed to provoke worry, use diagnoses confirmed by both youth and clinicians, track children across more developmental checkpoints, and hone in on finer brain regions and brain-age models to help test the signal we observed and what it someday may mean for the clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really appreciate the families and youth who participated in this research. We also hope that others will build on these findings and help move us toward more precise mental-health care for youth with generalized anxiety disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.005" target="_blank"&gt;Resting State Cortical Network and Subcortical Hyperconnectivity in Youth With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the ABCD Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sam A.

Each bird follows simple rules of interaction with its closest neighbours, yet out of these local interactions emerges a complex, coordinated dance that can respond swiftly to predators and environmental changes. This same principle of emergence – where sophisticated behaviours arise not from central control but from the interactions themselves – appears across nature and human society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how market prices emerge from countless individual trading decisions, none of which alone contains the ‘right’ price. Each trader acts on partial information and personal strategies, yet their collective interaction produces a dynamic system that integrates information from across the globe. Human language evolves through a similar process of emergence. No individual or committee decides that ‘LOL’ should enter common usage or that the meaning of ‘cool’ should expand beyond temperature (even in French-speaking countries). Instead, these changes result from millions of daily linguistic interactions, with new patterns of speech bubbling up from the collective behaviour of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples highlight a key characteristic of highly interconnected systems: the rich interplay of constituent parts generates properties that defy reductive analysis. This principle of emergence, evident across seemingly unrelated fields, provides a powerful lens for examining one of our era’s most elusive mysteries: how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of emergence inspired me to develop the concept I call the &lt;em&gt;entangled brain&lt;/em&gt;: the need to understand the brain as an interactionally complex system where functions emerge from distributed, overlapping networks of regions rather than being localised to specific areas. Though the framework described here is still a minority view in neuroscience, we’re witnessing a gradual paradigm transition (rather than a revolution), with increasing numbers of researchers acknowledging the limitations of more traditional ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;omplexity science is an interdisciplinary field that studies systems composed of many interacting components whose collective behaviours give rise to collective properties – phenomena that cannot be fully explained by analysing individual parts in isolation. These systems, such as ecosystems, economies or – as we will see – the brain, are characterised by nonlinear dynamics, adaptability, self-organisation, and networked interactions that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. Before exploring the ideas leading to the entangled brain framework, let’s revisit some of the historical developments of the field of neuroscience to set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1899, Cécile and Oskar Vogt, aged 24 and 29 respectively, arrived in Berlin to establish the Neurological Centre, initially a private institution for the anatomical study of the human brain that in 1902 was expanded to the Neurobiological Laboratory, and then the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in 1914. Cécile Vogt was one of only two women in the entire institute. (In Prussia, until 1908, women were not granted access to regular university education, let alone the possibility to have a scientific career.) She obtained her doctoral degree from the University of Paris in 1900, while her husband Oskar obtained a doctorate for his thesis on the &lt;em&gt;corpus callosum&lt;/em&gt; from the University of Jena &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;in 1894.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1901, Korbinian Brodmann, who had concluded his doctorate in Leipzig in 1898, joined the group headed by the Vogts and was encouraged by them to undertake a systematic study of the cells of the cerebral cortex using tissue sections stained with a new cell-marking method. (The cortex is the outer brain surface with grooves and bulges; the subcortex comprises other cell masses that sit underneath.) The Vogts, and Brodmann working separately, were part of a first wave of anatomists trying to establish a complete map of the cerebral cortex, with the ultimate goal of understanding how brain structure and function are related. In a nutshell, where does a mental function such as an emotion reside in the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons – a key cell type of the nervous system – are diverse, and several cell classes can be determined based on both their shape and size. Researchers used these properties, as well as spatial differences in distribution and density, to define the boundaries between potential sectors. In this manner, Brodmann subdivided the cortex into approximately 50 regions (also called areas) per hemisphere. The Vogts, in contrast, thought that there might be more than 200 of them, each with its own distinguishing cytoarchitectonic pattern (that is, cell-related organisation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;It is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodmann’s map is the one that caught on and stuck, likely because neuroanatomists opposed too vigorous a subdivision of the cortex, and today students and researchers alike still refer to cortical parts by invoking his map. Although relatively little was known about the functions of cortical regions at the time, Brodmann believed that his partition identified ‘organs of the mind’ – he was convinced that each cortical area subserved a particular function. Indeed, when he joined the Vogts’ laboratory, they had encouraged him to try to understand the organisation of the cortex in light of their main thesis that different cytoarchitectonically defined areas are responsible for specific physiological responses and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a deep logic that the Vogts and Brodmann were following. In fact, it is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure. In the case at hand, parts of the cortex that are structurally different (contain different cell types, cell arrangements, cell density, and so on) carry out different functions. In this manner, they believed they could understand how function is individuated from a detailed characterisation of the underlying microanatomy. They were in search of the &lt;em&gt;functional units &lt;/em&gt;of the cortex – where the function could be sensory, motor, cognitive and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other organs of the body that have more clear-cut boundaries, the cortex’s potential subdivisions are not readily apparent at a macroscopic level. One of the central goals of many neuroanatomists in the first half of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; was to investigate such ‘organs of the mind’ (an objective that persists to this day). A corollary of this research programme was that individual brain regions – say, Brodmann’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;area 17&lt;/span&gt; in the back of the brain – implemented specialised mechanisms, in this case related to processing visual sensory stimuli. Therefore, it was vital to understand the operation of individual parts since the area/region was the rightful mechanistic &lt;em&gt;unit &lt;/em&gt;to understand how the nervous system works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists’ interest in brain regions was motivated by the notion that each region executes a particular function. For example, we could say that the function of the primary visual cortex is visual perception, or perhaps a more basic visual mechanism, such as detecting ‘edges’ (sharp light-to-dark transitions) in images. The same type of description can be applied to other sensory and motor areas of the brain. This exercise becomes considerably less straightforward for brain areas that are much less sensory or motor, as their workings become exceedingly difficult to determine and describe. Nevertheless, in theory, we can imagine extending the idea to all parts of the brain. The result of this endeavour would be a list of area-function pairs: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;L &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;= {(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), … , (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)},&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;areas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;implement &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;functions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a serious problem with this endeavour. To date, no such list has been systematically generated. Indeed, current knowledge strongly suggests that this strategy will &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;yield a simple area-function list. What may start as a simple &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; pair, is gradually revised as research progresses, and eventually grows to include a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of functions, such that area &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; participates in a series of functions &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, … , &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; From a basic one-to-one &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mapping, the picture evolves to a one-to-&lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;mapping: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;… , F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mapping between structure and function is not one-to-one, then what kind of system is the brain? This is the question the entangled brain concept sets out to tackle. It’s useful to consider two types of information: anatomical and functional. Let’s start with the brain’s massive combinatorial anatomical connectivity. Neurons are constantly exchanging electrochemical signals with one another. Signalling between them is aided by physical cell extensions, called axons, that protrude beyond the cell body for distances from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to around &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 mm&lt;/span&gt; in the central nervous system. Axons travelling longer distances typically bundle together along what are called white-matter tracts to distinguish them from tissue composed of neuronal cell bodies, which is called grey matter. Anatomical connectivity, then, can be viewed as a system of roads and highways that supports cell signalling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hile most connections are local, the brain also maintains an impressive network of medium- and long-distance pathways. To give a rough sense of the dimensions involved, axonal lengths within local brain circuits (such as those within a single Brodmann area) have lengths from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to just under &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 cm.&lt;/span&gt; Connections between adjacent and nearby regions can extend between 0.5 to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;4 cm,&lt;/span&gt; and connections between areas in different lobes, such as between the frontal and the occipital lobes, can reach &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 cm&lt;/span&gt; or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although details vary across mammalian species, there’s evidence that the brains of macaque monkeys (a species that has a brain organisation resembling that of humans) are densely interconnected. For example, when scientists looked at any two regions in the cortex, they found that about &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;60 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the time there’s a direct connection between them (although the strength of the pathway decreases between regions that are farther apart). Notably, the cortex organises medium- and long-distance communication through special regions that act like major transportation hubs, routing and coordinating signals across the entire cortex, much like how major airports serve as central connection points in the global air transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just part of the story. Beyond the extensive interconnections found in the cortex, there are multiple ‘connectional systems’ that weave together regions even further. The entire cortex connects to deeper brain structures. We can think of the brain as having distinct sectors. Simplifying somewhat, these are the cortex, the subcortical parts that are physically beneath the cortex in humans, and the brainstem. In the 1980s, it became clear that the cortex and subcortex are part of extensive connectional loops – from cortex to subcortex back to cortex. We now know that the multiple sectors are amply interlinked. What is more, a subcortical structure such as the thalamus, viewed in the past as a relatively passive steppingstone conveying signals to the cortex, is so sweepingly interconnected with the entire cortex that it is perhaps better to think in terms of a cortical-thalamic system. Even subcortical areas believed to mainly control basic functions, like the hypothalamus, which regulates hunger and body temperature among others, have widespread connections throughout the brain. This creates an incredibly intricate connectional web where signals can travel between disparate parts through multiple routes, hence the idea of ‘combinatorial’ connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of the connectional organisation of the brain? The dense nexus of pathways allows for remarkable flexibility in how the brain processes information and controls behaviour. Signals of all types can be exchanged and integrated in multiple ways. All this potential mixing strongly challenges how we traditionally think of the mind and brain in terms of simplistic labels such as ‘perception’, ‘cognition’, ‘emotion’ and ‘action’. I will return to this point later, but the standard view is further challenged by a second principle of brain organisation: highly distributed functional coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman Empire’s roads, critical to its success, were extensive enough to circle the globe about twice over. In addition to obvious military applications, the road network supported trade, as well as cultural and administrative integration. These economic and cultural relationships and coordination between disparate parts of the empire were sustained by the incredible physical infrastructure known as the &lt;em&gt;cursus publicus&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise, in the brain we need to move beyond the anatomical domain (the roads) to functional properties (such as economic and cultural relationships between different parts of the Roman Empire), all the more because neuroscientists themselves often focus too much on anatomical features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, functional relationships between neuronal signals are detected across multiple spatial scales – from the local scale of neurons within a brain area to larger scales involving signals originating from the grey matter of different lobes (such as the frontal and parietal lobes, many centimetres apart). By signals, we mean the electrical activity of neurons that is directly recorded via microelectrodes inserted into grey matter (ie, neuronal tissue), measured indirectly when using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, or possibly via other measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of functional relationships are detected? An important one is that signals from different sites exhibit synchronised neuronal activity. This is notable because groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated, and potentially part of a common process. Different types of signal coordination are believed to reflect processes such as attention and memory, among others. Additional types of relationships are detected mathematically, too, such as whether the strength of the response in one brain area is related to the temporal evolution of signals in a disparate location. In the brain, we identify signal relationships that are indicators of joint functions between regions, much like detecting cultural exchanges between separate parts of the Roman Empire via evidence of shared artefacts or language patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When signals are measured from two sites within a local patch (say, a few millimetres across), it is not too surprising to find notable functional relationships between them (eg, their neuronal activity is correlated), as neurons likely receive similar inputs and are locally connected. Yet, we also observe functional relationships between neuronal signals from locations that are situated much farther apart and, critically, between brain parts that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; directly anatomically connected – there is no direct axonal connection between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this happen? There is evidence that signal coordination between regions depends more on the total number of possible communication routes between them than on the existence of direct connections between points A and B. For example, although regions A and B are not anatomically connected, they both connect to region C, which thus serves as a bridge between them. Even more circuitous paths can unite A and B, much like flying between two cities that have no direct flights and require multiple layovers. In such a manner, the brain creates functional partnerships that take advantage of all possible ways through its intricate pathways. This helps explain how the brain can be so remarkably flexible, sustaining different partnerships between regions depending on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen we consider the highways traversing the brain and how signals establish behaviourally relevant relationships across the central nervous system, we come to an important insight. In a highly interconnected system, to understand function, we need to shift away from thinking in terms of individual brain regions. The functional unit is not to be found at the level of the brain area, as commonly proposed. Instead, we need to consider neuronal ensembles distributed across multiple brain regions, much like the murmuration of starlings forms a single pattern from the collective behaviour of individual birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many instances of distributed neuronal ensembles. Groups of neurons extending over cortical (say, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) and subcortical (say, amygdala) regions form circuits that are important for learning what is threatening and what is safe. Such multiregion circuits are ubiquitous; fMRI studies in humans have shown that the brain is organised in terms of large-scale networks that stretch across the cortex as well as subcortical territories. For example, the so-called ‘salience network’ (suggested to be engaged when significant events are encountered) spans brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes, among others, and can also be viewed as a neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we consider ensembles in the case of brain circuits or large-scale networks, the associated neuronal groupings should be viewed as strongly context dependent and dynamic. That is to say, they are not fixed entities but instead form dynamically to meet current situational requirements. Accordingly, they will dynamically assemble and disassemble as per behavioural needs. The implication of this view is that whereas brain regions A, B and C might generally be active together in dealing with a specific type of behaviour, in some contexts, we will also observe an ensemble that encompasses &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;region D,&lt;/span&gt; or instead the ensemble &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;{A, C, D}&lt;/span&gt; that meets slightly different requirements. In all, neuronal ensembles constitute an extremely malleable functional unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of how an orchestra works during a complex piece of music. The string section might split into different groups, with some violins joining the woodwinds for one musical phrase while others harmonise with the cellos. Later, these groupings shift completely for a different passage. The brain works in a related way: rather than recruiting fixed regions, it forms flexible aggregations that assemble and disassemble based on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling. This builds on what we learned about the brain’s extensive physical connections and the coordinated activity across regions. These features make the formation of ensembles possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is common in science, these ideas have a long genealogy. In 1949, the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that the brain’s ability to generate coherent thoughts derives from the spatiotemporal orchestration of neuronal activity. He hypothesised that a discrete, strongly interconnected group of active neurons called the &lt;em&gt;cell assembly&lt;/em&gt; represents a distinct mental entity, such as a thought or an emotion. Yet, these ideas have taken a long time to mature, not least due to technical limitations in measuring signals simultaneously across the brain, and the relative insularity of experimental neuroscience from other disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a symphony emerges from both the individual instruments and how they play together, brain function emerges from both the regions themselves and their dynamic interactions. Scientists are finding that we can’t understand complex mental processes by studying individual brain regions in isolation, any more than we could understand a symphony by listening to each instrument separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly fascinating is that these brain assemblages overlap and change over time. Just as a violin might be part of the string section in one moment and join a smaller ensemble in the next, brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed. But note that, in this view, even brain networks aren’t seen as constituted of fixed sets of regions; instead, they are dynamic coalitions that form and dissolve based on the brain’s changing needs. This flexibility helps explain how the brain can support such a wide range of complex behaviours using a limited number of regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories such as perception, cognition, action, emotion and motivation are not only the titles of introductory textbooks, but reflect how psychologists and neuroscientists conceptualise the organisation of the mind and brain. They seek to subdivide the brain into territories that have preferences for processes that support a specific type of mental activity. Some parts handle perception, such as the back of the head and its involvement in vision, or the front of the brain and its role in cognition. And so on. The decomposition of the mind-brain adopted by many neuroscientists follows an organisation that is called modular. Modularity here refers to the idea that the brain consists of specialised, relatively independent components or modules that each handle specific mental functions, much like distinct parts in a machine that work together but perform separate operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, a modular organisation, popular as it is among neuroscientists, is inconsistent with the principles of the anatomical and functional neuroarchitecture discussed here. The brain’s massive combinatorial connectivity and highly distributed functional coordination defy clean compartmentalisation. The extensive bidirectional pathways spanning the entire brain create crisscrossing connectional systems that dissolve potential boundaries between traditional mental domains (cognition, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;emotion, etc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain regions dynamically affiliate with multiple networks in a context-dependent manner, forming coalitions that assemble and disassemble based on current demands. This interactional complexity means that functions aren’t localised to discrete modules but emerge from decentralised coordination across multiregion assemblies. The properties that emerge from these interactions cannot be reduced to individual components, making a strict modular framework inadequate for capturing the brain’s entangled nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the brain so entangled, and thus so unlike human-engineered systems? Brains have evolved to provide adaptive responses to challenges faced by living beings, promoting survival and reproduction – not to solve isolated cognitive or emotional problems. In this context, even the mental vocabulary of neuroscience and psychology (attention, cognitive control, fear, etc), with origins disconnected from the study of animal behaviour, provides problematic theoretical pillars. Instead, approaches inspired by evolutionary considerations provide better scaffolds to sort out the relationships between brain structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the entangled brain are substantial for the understanding of healthy and unhealthy brain processes. It is common for scientists to seek a single, unique source of psychological distress. For example, anxiety or PTSD is the result of an overactive amygdala; depression is caused by deficient serotonin provision; drug addiction is produced by dopamine oversupply. But, according to the ideas described here, we should not expect unique determinants for psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities. Alterations across several brain circuits, spanning multiple brain regions, are almost certainly involved. As a direct consequence, healthy or unhealthy states should not be viewed as emotional, motivational or cognitive. Such classification is superficial and neglects the intermingling that results from anatomical and functional brain organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also not expect to find a single culprit, not even at the level of distributed neuronal ensembles. The conditions in question are too heterogeneous and varied across individuals; they won’t map to a single alteration, including at the distributed level. In fact, we should not expect a temporally constant type of disturbance, as brain processes are highly context-dependent and dynamic. Variability in the very dynamics will contribute to how mental health experiences are manifested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we need to stop seeking simple explanations for complex mind-brain processes, whether they are viewed as healthy or unhealthy. That’s perhaps the most general implication of the entangled brain view: that the functions of the brain, like the murmurations of starlings, are more complicated and more mysterious than its component parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:04:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbDJobXBaTzlmT21lZ2tPLWJ3dDlVU182T3dQS29wYVZBUFJCMVgzT21fU05CTlYtcVdjVlBvdVl2eTk5dHZYSi1PV1Nxb1BKVTgtSEhSYVo3WHgybjFvUmFaQ3had3BlaHM0WDRMbUF5RnpQWEJDQ3U0TzJqWUtjbnNwWQ</guid></item><item><title>每天只需5分钟这些练习就可以随着年龄的增长磨练你的大脑-洛杉矶时报 | Just 5 minutes a day of these exercises can sharpen your brain as you age - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWmlvcmk2UFk2Z0M4T1ptVUljemE0NXI2ekFsR1RJckhLRE1fbnRFM3F3V2xQX2huTGhsUTY5YmZDX1ZPb1B6eU80REtPRzZvR0g3ZUVwbnZCUTh4S2F4bTdXN0wzOGExT3pPNks1bldCdXhfdVdHSGFiWDV0X0lnMHZad2ZGbHVoSlhfQjFaNE9pRE5xaDBzX3RfQmZJbmppNjFLcWMyOHNEeG5zUHllLVBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix max-w-170 mt-7.5 mb-10 mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise has long been linked with stronger brains and reduced risk of dementia and other cognitive diseases.

They also found that even a few minutes of moderate exercise like walking improves brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our key finding was that moving from doing zero minutes or very little moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to doing just five minutes a day — that’s where the biggest gain in cognitive function was seen,” said the study’s lead author, Maddison Mellow, a research associate at the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers distinguished between moderate and vigorous exercise by applying a simple test: whether subjects could still manage to speak full sentences after moving around. Vigorous exercise makes that impossible, said Audrey Collins, a postdoctoral research scientist at AdventHealth Research Institute and the paper’s co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study observed 585 people, all in good health. Their physical activity was measured using accelerometers they wore on their wrists; the researchers tested cognitive functions using online and paper-based tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth noting: This study also found a “strong relationship” between spending little to no time doing moderate to vigorous activity and poorer cognitive performance, Mellow said. One slightly surprising finding, she added, was that the cognitive performance gains from exercise don’t extend to longer-term memory and visual-spatial functions like judging distances or sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was novel in that it categorized how people divided their days into three behaviors: sleep, sedentary and active. And though &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041610225002704" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;getting enough quality sleep is important to brain health in midlife&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, the researchers said that when forced to choose between minutes spent sleeping and minutes spent exercising, reducing sleep time to spend more time moving resulted in better brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It didn’t really matter, in this sample, where time was coming from, whether from sleep, sedentary behavior or light intensity physical activity,” Mellow said. “So long as time was being increased in moderate vigorous activity, that’s where the benefits were being shown for cognitive outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, what are some moderate or vigorous bursts of exercise for older adults to do every day? We consulted experts to give you five accessible options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1-walking" class="subhead"&gt;1. Walking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two experts I spoke with each said the easiest way to clock those five daily minutes for brain health is by walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is No. 1, because that’s the easiest,” said E. Todd Schroeder, professor of clinical physical therapy and the director of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://sites.usc.edu/cerc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Exercise Research Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at USC. Very sedentary older adults may want to start with simple flat-ground walking at their normal pace, Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already a steady, regular walker, kick up the pace to elevate your heart rate into that all-important moderate category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brisk walk is considered to be moderate activity,” said Rob Musci, an assistant professor of health and human sciences at Loyola Marymount University. On a scale of 1 to 10, moderate exercise is what you would consider being in the 4 to 6 range, Musci said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve a real huff-and-puff workout, walking or hiking briskly uphill is excellent, Schroeder said, because it also necessarily requires walking back down hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That interval-type training is good,” he said, “where your heart rate goes up for a time then comes back down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="2-swimming" class="subhead"&gt;2. Swimming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming is a terrific way to get a full-body workout and raise your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s easy on the joints,” Shroeder said. “Even if you struggle with the technique of swimming, you can put on fins and get some at least moderate exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="3-cycling" class="subhead"&gt;3. Cycling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycling can be on a stationary bike or an outdoor bike, many of which are now battery-assisted, making pedaling up hills almost too easy. One reason I like old-fashioned outdoor bikes, sans batteries, is that they also train balance and require your brain to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="4-resistance-training" class="subhead"&gt;4. Resistance training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting weights is one of the best ways to maintain muscle strength as we age, Musci said. Try these simple exercises you can easily do at home in fewer than three minutes. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tossing a weighted ball from one hand to another (try it standing on one leg)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squats holding a kettlebell, dumbbell, a bag of oranges or nothing at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weighted chest presses in boat pose &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="5-gardening-and-housework" class="subhead"&gt;5. Gardening and housework&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardening can be a great way to engage core muscles, encourage flexibility and practice fine motor skills. Even basic house cleaning, like scrubbing a bathtub or mopping a floor, can qualify as moderate exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that gets your heart going is what we’re looking for,” Musci said. “You hear about all these high-end interventions, fitness programs and boot camps, but in reality, it’s just movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing, he said, is “just getting off the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;on Zielbauer is the creator of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://agingwithstrength.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aging With Strength&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; on Substack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWmlvcmk2UFk2Z0M4T1ptVUljemE0NXI2ekFsR1RJckhLRE1fbnRFM3F3V2xQX2huTGhsUTY5YmZDX1ZPb1B6eU80REtPRzZvR0g3ZUVwbnZCUTh4S2F4bTdXN0wzOGExT3pPNks1bldCdXhfdVdHSGFiWDV0X0lnMHZad2ZGbHVoSlhfQjFaNE9pRE5xaDBzX3RfQmZJbmppNjFLcWMyOHNEeG5zUHllLVBB</guid></item><item><title>每天只需5分钟这些练习就可以随着年龄的增长磨练你的大脑-雅虎 | Just 5 minutes a day of these exercises can sharpen your brain as you age - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcmdPNFA5V3NmSGFQMXR4RmVSVUtJeGRKLVhYZ25vXzFoLUwtd2x1elptTkNSLTlUbG1kS3FPblJyenZ0NnV5b1EtS0x5UGVDUUstZU54dFJVRUlCc0hiRjU1WHozUVRwcUJBZm5UcVRoRkQzYnRXQ25VNS1wb0dZbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;(Photo illustration by Jim Cooke / photos by Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Exercise has long been linked with stronger brains and reduced risk of dementia and other cognitive diseases.

The bad news: people are finding ticks everywhere, especially on themselves and their pets. The good news: so far there aren't huge numbers of reported illnesses or diseases due to ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that will probably change — unless people take precautions, and even then there's a chance a tick bite could lead to an infection, or even a virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Lately there's not only been a ton of calls, but field staff are collecting tons," said Lee Green, senior medical entomologist at the &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Indiana Department of Health (IDOT)&lt;/a&gt;, about this year's tick populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At this point in the year, Green said ticks are mostly in the nymph stage, which means they are smaller than the adults and harder to spot when they're crawling on people or pets. While the infection rate for adult ticks is double that of nymphs, Green said nymphs transmit more diseases to people because they are so small and are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We see the most Lyme disease in humans during the season of nymphs," he said. "They're starting to come out now," which means the IDOH is trying to spread information about prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173589007-ticks-and-dime-monroe-county.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173589007-ticks-and-dime-monroe-county.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="These ticks, 4 lone star adult females, 5 lone star adult males and 57 lone star nymphs, were found in Monroe County in May 2024 by Monroe County Health Department employee Kody Clark.

Gulf Coast ticks can be found as far north as Hamilton County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They look very similar to the American dog tick," Green said. "Right now they are found in 14 counties from central Indiana to the southwestern part of the state. The more we look for (Gulf Coast ticks), the more we find it in other areas, as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Asian longhorned tick is the newest in Indiana and was the first tick "to invade the whole U.S." in the past 80 years, according to Green. So far the Asian tick has been found only in Switzerland, Ohio, Dubois and Spencer counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While Asian longhorned ticks don't usually bite people, they are a problem for livestock. Green said that in lab conditions, the ticks can transmit human pathogens but that hasn't been identified anywhere else. It does transmit a parasite that's detrimental to cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/12/NHEN/83580191007-dr-adams-1.png?width=300&amp;amp;height=420&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/12/NHEN/83580191007-dr-adams-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;height=840&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dr. Robert Adams is an emergency medicine physician with Indiana University Health Bloomington."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dr. Robert Adams is an emergency medicine physician with Indiana University Health Bloomington." data-c-credit="Courtesy Photo/IU Health"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Robert Adams, emergency medicine physician with IU Health Bloomington, said Indiana has between 300 and 400 tick-related cases each year. While hundreds of cases of tick-borne illness may seem like a lot, Adams said that's a low number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lyme disease is one of the most common, with most cases in the northwest part of Indiana. After a tick with Lyme disease bites a person, they will usually develop a "target" rash that is red in the center, surrounded by a circle of white and then circle of red — similar to a target. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and ehrlichiosis are two of the most common illnesses found in southern Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Ticks can transmit viruses, and a meat allergy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A new worry for Hoosiers is that some ticks are carrying two types of virus that they can transmit to people. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bourbon-virus/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bourbon virus&lt;/a&gt;, named for the Kansas county were it was first found, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt; leave people feeling achy and feverish, with fatigue, rash and headache. For these, antibiotics won't work, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It will just have to run its course," he said, adding it's not known if there are any long-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another malady ticks can pass on to people is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which is an allergy to red meat. After an infected tick bites a person, it leaves behind a sugar molecule in the bloodstream that triggers a new immune response. If that person eats food that contains a-gal (red meat and other mammalian products), they have an allergic reaction that can range from hives and an upset stomach to life-threatening anaphylaxis. There's no way of knowing who has the allergy until they develop a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams said some people with alpha-gal can still eat chicken, but most can no longer eat beef or pork. He believes some people may actually have the allergy and not know it, suffering heartburn or hives and not realizing the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'm finding more and more people have it," he said. The way to know for sure is to have an antibody blood test taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green explained that alpha-gal is transmitted by lone star ticks. In Indiana there were two pockets of lone star ticks — near Lake Michigan and a larger population in southern Indiana. But those two populations are growing and coming together, becoming more common in and around Monroe County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What ticks are found in Indiana, Monroe County?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370889007-2-blacklegged-tick-ixodes-scapularis-female.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=305&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370889007-2-blacklegged-tick-ixodes-scapularis-female.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=610&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Microscope image of a Blacklegged tick."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Microscope image of a Blacklegged tick." data-c-credit="Provided By Delaware DNREC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Indiana has six &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/zoonotic-and-vectorborne-epidemiology-entomology/vector-borne-diseases/tick-borne-diseases/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ticks that spread diseases and illnesses to people&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it is a concern for cattle and other livestock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kody Clark, with the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/department/?structureid=12" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, said as of May 8, his agency has received reports of 20 American dog ticks and 18 lone star ticks. The reports were delivered to the health department through its Citizen Tick Reporter Web app, at &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/tr4ykamr" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;https://tinyurl.com/tr4ykamr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173590007-ticks-drag-cloth-monroe-county.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173590007-ticks-drag-cloth-monroe-county.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kody Clark, an employee at the Monroe County Health Department, uses a drag cloth to capture ticks in Bloomington area parks in May 2024."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kody Clark, an employee at the Monroe County Health Department, uses a drag cloth to capture ticks in Bloomington area parks in May 2024." data-c-credit="Courtesy Photo/Kody Clark"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clark said the most common places people reported finding American dog ticks were inside their homes. Most lone star ticks were discovered on people's skin. Clark anticipated more reports through June and hopes people will use the app to report what ticks they have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While Clark hasn't seen any reports of Gulf Coast ticks in Monroe County, he believes they are present because they are established in Lawrence, Greene and Hendricks counties, according to IDOH maps. "It is just a matter of finding and identifying them," he said in an email. "The Asian longhorned tick is another one on our radar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clark will be using drag cloths this month in Bloomington-area parks to get a better idea of which ticks are prevalent in the area. Last year, Clark found mostly lone star ticks, followed by the American dog tick and then the black-legged tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Ways to prevent tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green and Adams agree that preventing ticks from being nearby or having a chance to latch on to a person are the best ways to avoid illnesses. And now is the time to start prevention measures, with Adams stating, "We're not seeing a lot in the ER but we're being told that people are picking off ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370929007-3-american-dog-tick-dermacentor-variabilis-female-dorsal.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=470&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370929007-3-american-dog-tick-dermacentor-variabilis-female-dorsal.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=940&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Microscopic image of an American Dog tick."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Microscopic image of an American Dog tick." data-c-credit="Provided By Delaware DNREC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that have been sprayed with .5% permethrin is the best defense when outside. Spraying exposed skin with repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-methane-diol are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green also recommends boot gaiters soaked in permethrin for people who walk in tall grassy areas. The gaiters help keep ticks on the outside of clothes, just as tucking pants legs into socks does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doing a check for ticks after being outside, even in your yard, is a good idea. Green said black-legged ticks (also known as deer ticks) like to "feed where they land." Sometimes that can be hard-to-see places such as the back of a person's knee. And if it's a nymph, it's even more difficult to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Keeping ticks out of your yard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even if a person doesn't get a disease from a tick, if it bites them, Green said there can be infections that can cause future health issues. Again, he emphasized prevention is best, adding people can do more by making modifications to their landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/08/03/PELM/70522968007-deertick.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=447&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="The black-legged tick, also called the deer tick or bear tick, is a carrier of Borrelia burgdorfi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="The black-legged tick, also called the deer tick or bear tick, is a carrier of Borrelia burgdorfi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease." data-c-credit="Jim Gathany / Centers For Disease Control And Prevention"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ticks need high humidity because they absorb water vapor through their mouth parts. Take away the humidity and ticks will disappear. Mowed grass that has sunshine to dry it out and doing away with ground covers that hold in moisture will help. Place swing sets and play areas in sunny areas, not shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Residences with wooded, shady areas can create areas where ticks are less likely to thrive by building a physical barrier with gravel or wood chips near play areas or patios. Green said pets and deer, and even people, can transport ticks across the gravel or wood chips, so be aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What to do after a tick bite?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you do find a tick that's attached and not just crawling on your skin, IU Health's Dr. Adams suggests removing it carefully to ensure the whole tick is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams advises people to take a "watch and wait approach" if they find a tick. If a tick hasn't been attached for more than 48 hours, it's unlikely it will transmit a disease. However, it can take one to two weeks before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The prevalence of tick-borne illnesses is kind-of low," he said. "The odds are that you're not going to get anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But if symptoms (rash, fever, swelling of the bite site) do appear, Adams said it's best to go to a walk-in or urgent care clinic. Antibiotics given quickly can help lessen the impact of any transmitted diseases for most people and a blood test can be taken to identify the exact illnesses if needed, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Remember, alpha-gal and the new viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact Carol Kugler at ckugler@heraldt.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Herald-Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 08:54:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxQNXlJZFFNTlFpT0dQa0RsWnhXQWYtZXlVUzhnMUMxS296Qkppam9iMnhCcXhzQm1BdFIzRDd0MFR4bXBqdnBlZWxEeFdjWm1RQXc0aENLWnA4SU1PWUpfRFBKWVNkRzAzUE5DVjdsQ3ZPVXFpUTdYeDFlZG45MmxSR3dSc2pWQnYtWUZSMTZsc3dIbmJMWDhhQjRseWJ3bjBrdjBnQ21JWjdPSDhVVm4zZ21vakJ0c21mbFdKekZBeFAzUnhwWm1rc1N0WC04VnRTM0NLUklZMTh6Ti1ZSk9tOG9Bdw</guid></item><item><title>美国已有3个月没有出现人类禽流感病例。专家们想知道为什么- Medical Xpress | The US hasn't seen a human bird flu case in 3 months.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We just don't know why there haven't been cases," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. "I think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bird+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S.—most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infected+people/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infected people&lt;/a&gt; had mild illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in &lt;a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/ODH-News-Releases/ohio-reports-first-human-case-of-bird-flu-021225" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation's infections in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dairy+cattle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The possible natural reason bird flu cases are down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural—maybe temporary—decline in cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;limited activity&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New infections are still being detected in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as frequently as several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it's not surprising that human cases have declined as well," the CDC said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are government cuts affecting bird flu monitoring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn't concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that anybody's hiding anything," said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government's bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said "targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;h2&gt;CDC says the risk to the general public remains low&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wild+birds/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wild birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.html" target="_blank"&gt;an agency assessment&lt;/a&gt; said there is a "moderate risk" that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, research is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have had very good participation," Douphrate said. "They have been very willing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar surveillance is "urgently needed" among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/domestic+cats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt; infected with the virus across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu—or whether the virus can spill over into people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman has been collecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do," she said. "But what we really need to be doing is ramping up."&lt;/p&gt;

That is a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesvaeld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, has urged caution when it comes to taurine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods. This includes meat, fish, and eggs. The amino acid is also found in the brain, heart, and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;KIRO TV adds that cancer patients sometimes take it to ease chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“Dr. Bajaj’s work shows that local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in the use of high-dose taurine supplementation,” Liesveld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers said more work needs to be done to understand what role taurine plays in cancer development and resistance to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Bajaj said one of the next steps is to study taurine levels in leukemia patients. Then, develop methods for safely blocking taurine from entering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy, our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,” the authors wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SIGN UP: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters" target="_self" rel="" title="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHIO TV</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 08:14:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNLXNrM3hDUE9Icy1mc04xRHA4XzZjUHNuUW14VzhSdjBWVFYzYWRacS01RjdPSE0wTVJLMGdsYUxILXN0S0FxNFp4WDEtN3lqWlo3Z2V5WXRjSXkwbUQwdjg0YmEwc0lYbl9EVkxRbWJuOHA1WXNaaVN1Z1RqSE5PWWIybmNyQjQ5anZiU04yRzV4aGdmY09vNktKejVBMWFVOXhXYnM4OG9zWVFIMG1CN293c2k5cmRBYnFac1NheXlwWURYYklYWNIB3AFBVV95cUxOZmNFcC1oaF8ycl9ndnptazF3OFI3TGZBa1N2NkY1TkdOem1CR184NkpGanlpQjE4aHFmUUdsU0IyZmxMX1dfYUlJVGlwOXNoZXlLZi1ZZENmOGdWbWwyX0tUQTVGWVZIMndYZXJ2N1hEc21jYlpfcklTUHNSTEVRSDBJcmptWEExUnlWa2xoQ2hwa2FfQkc0SEk4dzBKTF9rdWhoZ2FpeDk1U0h1d0ZXSDRxNTBqWTZhcWVwUkhKdDNBN283MzRnczcxcjZ3WjU2YWtzQWhQU1BOeklP</guid></item><item><title>立即减少饮酒，以降低患痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Drink to cut back on now to reduce risk of developing dementia - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9NdVNDMExqRE55Wi0zMTZGZHlwbWxha3VUVG9MeVZtQlVhWjRDLS1oVW0zMktOMWJ2b2JRdDZQVWxybGc3ZjN1bVRYSFA1ZmNGS0lhVGFuRjltZmItcHlPN3pGRnZVSkhORnBwSUVFN0xBOGtaUnRMUmlzWmhYN3PSAYQBQVVfeXFMTVhYdUwtV2Z4UVlfZXN1QzVJQUhUNGM3ei16ekpEcTQyRXpEMzRZbEJJclJwdGFPaEFMdEVibF80TWRtYVRhOFZ0ZmtwdkdHNkplYy1SR2tKakVxMDhHeFJWRmxHTU1oRUZ2N01ncXFtdDNaV1loYWUzVElxbkdILU9xZDJO?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/dementia" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; is categorised by abnormal brain changes.

&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to think about aging, but it’s a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every passing year from your mid-40s, muscle mass tends to become harder to maintain, bones weaken, joints stiffen and cardiovascular fitness declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; master trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/jc_training_/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/jc_training_/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jack Claxton&lt;/a&gt;, everybody has two trump cards we can play to offset this natural ageing process—and the earlier we start, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving your VO2 max and regular strength training are two massive things for longevity,” Claxton tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together they are going to be what makes the greatest difference when you’re 70, 80 or 90 to your mobility, strength and ability to be independent,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At David Lloyd Clubs, Claxton trains a broad range of clients, young and old, experienced and inexperienced, but his advice always returns to these two principles. Here’s why and how to get started on improving each one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Strength training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Johner Images / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular strength training with your bodyweight or resistance, and especially with free weights, improves stability, which is crucial to avoid falls as you age,” says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-d7oLm4rhntaXEJv9kEioek" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-d7oLm4rhntaXEJv9kEioek slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also helps maintain muscle mass to offset &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Sarcopenia" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Sarcopenia" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt; and improves bone density to ward off &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Osteoporosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Osteoporosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity expert Professor Michael Snyder PhD, senior author of a recent study that found the aging process accelerates at around 44 years of age and again at 60, echoed Claxton's sentiment &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-longevity-expert-says-you-should-be-doing-this-type-of-exercise-by-your-mid-40s-to-slow-the-aging-process" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-longevity-expert-says-you-should-be-doing-this-type-of-exercise-by-your-mid-40s-to-slow-the-aging-process"&gt;when speaking to &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt; late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to keep your muscle mass up throughout your life because it really generates a lot of very useful hormones,” says Snyder. “They call them mitokines or exerkines, these molecules that are very beneficial for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to improve your strength&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484" target="_blank" data-url="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from renowned fitness expert &lt;a href="https://www.lehman.edu/academics/health-human-services-nursing/exercise-sciences-recreation/bradley-schoenfeld/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.lehman.edu/academics/health-human-services-nursing/exercise-sciences-recreation/bradley-schoenfeld/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Brad Schoenfeld PhD&lt;/a&gt; and others found that the minimum effective dose to enjoy the benefits of strength training is much lower than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that two 30-minute sessions of resistance training per week is plenty to increase muscle and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that performing just one set per strength exercise, stopping within two reps of the point of failure (known as &lt;a href="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve"&gt;two reps in reserve&lt;/a&gt;) is a “time-efficient strategy for promoting muscular adaptations”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-vo2-max"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

But, as with your heart, regular exercise can slow or even reverse this natural decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend too much time on the internet and you will see many experts insist VO2 max is improved with intense interval sessions. They’re not wrong, but for many of us, epecially those who are returning to exercise, it can pay to start slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no right or wrong approach to cardio,” says Claxton. “It just comes down to what you enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So for an absolute beginner, who might not be doing anything at the minute, something as simple as going out for a walk every day would be an improvement.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve walked 5,000 steps every single morning for the last five years, and it’s changed my life. Some mornings I’ve walked alone, other mornings I’ve walked with my spaniel, and more recently, I’ve been carrying my baby in a sling, but what started as a way to get through the lockdown has become a habit I can’t shake, and it’s done wonders for my health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness editor and marathon runner, I’m always writing about HIIT workouts and marathon training plans, but there’s a lot to be said for just walking. Firstly, it’s free — you don’t need fancy shoes, or even one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers &lt;/a&gt;to get started. Secondly, it’s suitable for everyone, whatever level of fitness you’re at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5,000 steps feels like a big number, but for most people, it’s between two and two and a half miles. Sure, everyone shouts about doing 10,000 steps a day, and while this is a reasonable target, it won’t be suitable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, research published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;European Journal of Preventative Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; found that as few as 2,337 steps a day lessened the risk of dying from heart and circulatory diseases, and 3,867 steps reduced the risk of dying from any cause. On most days, I’d do more than 5,000 steps, but it was my benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the physical and mental benefits I’ve noticed from years of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-it-s-boosted-my-mood-and-lowered-my-stress-levels"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. It’s boosted my mood and lowered my stress levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From lockdown stress to moving house and changing jobs, my daily walks have helped my mental health in numerous ways. When I was pregnant, my low-impact walks were a great way of keeping fit, and when I was suffering with postpartum depression following the birth of my little boy, it was a way to catch my breath and feel like myself again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1609-y" target="_blank" data-url="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1609-y" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that walking is good for your mental health, especially if you can do it outside in nature rather than on a treadmill in the gym. If heading out for an hour-long walk feels too difficult or overwhelming, just do 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tbEQ5DzmuuyMArZHQ2SNCn" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tbEQ5DzmuuyMArZHQ2SNCn slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grab a coffee and a podcast, or meet a friend and do a lap around your local park. Alternatively, jump off the bus or the subway a stop sooner and add some steps to your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-it-s-been-a-fantastic-form-of-active-recovery"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. It’s been a fantastic form of active recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run marathons for fun, and since starting my daily walks, I haven’t been injured half as much. Of course, this could be down to getting fitter and stronger as a runner, but active recovery can help reduce your risk of injury by maintaining joint mobility, as well as reducing lactic acid buildup and metabolic waste, which can lead to stiffness and soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss isn’t my goal, but walking every day also burns calories, supports fat loss, and can help regulate blood sugar levels. If you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking"&gt;walking for weight loss,&lt;/a&gt; you’ll want to make sure you’re in a calorie deficit — burning more calories than you consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about picking up the pace or adding hills to your route to increase your calorie expenditure. It’s also a good idea to invest in a fitness tracker to monitor your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-it-s-never-felt-like-a-chore"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. It’s never felt like a chore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness editor, I really believe that the best way to integrate regular exercise into your routine is to find the form of exercise you enjoy, that doesn’t feel like a chore. I never woke up and dreaded my walk, and even before getting a dog, it was a non-negotiable part of my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, having the extra motivation of a wagging tail makes it easier to get out the door, but I’d also take time to make a coffee, or find an audiobook I wanted to listen to the night before, to help motivate me to jump out of bed and walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re finding walking boring, why not change your route every couple of days? For me, I’d head out for a hilly walk, or speed up my cadence when I wanted to increase the intensity of the walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-i-ve-spent-more-time-in-nature"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. I’ve spent more time in nature &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily improves your heart health, lowers your blood pressure, and reduces the risk of heart disease and Alzheimer's. Yet, along with the health benefits, walking every morning has helped get me outside in all weathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether I was lapping the park or heading to my local woods, I’d start my morning with some fresh air. Now I have a toddler in tow, it’s even more important for me to get outside every single day, whatever the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to walk more, it might help to invest in some kit that’ll keep you comfortable. For most people, a set of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes"&gt;best running shoes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-skechers-shoes-in-year" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-skechers-shoes-in-year"&gt;best Skechers&lt;/a&gt; is enough to keep them comfy, but if you are heading out to more challenging terrain, check out the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-hiking-boots" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-hiking-boots"&gt;best hiking boots&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daily walk is something I’ll continue to do — it boosts my mood, regulates my blood sugar, helps keep me fit, and reduces my risk of serious conditions. In an era when there’s a new type of wonder workout every month, this low-impact, free form of exercise is a huge winner. So what are you waiting for?

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss, surveys suggest that most people still &lt;a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/ddlsxvhlvp/pcrm-mc-weight-loss-report-9.27.24"&gt;prefer to lose weight without using medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those preferring a drug-free approach to weight loss, research shows that certain nutrients and dietary strategies can naturally mimic the effects of semaglutides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased intakes of fibre and monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) – as well as the time of day when foods are eaten, the order that foods are eaten in, the speed of eating and even chewing – can naturally stimulate increased production of the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a family physician with a PhD in nutrition, I translate the latest nutrition science into dietary recommendations for my patients. A strategic approach to weight loss rooted in the latest science is not only superior to antiquated calorie counting, but also capitalizes on the same biological mechanisms responsible for the success of popular weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="olive oil pouring into a glass dish, with some green olives" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Increased intake of monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) is one factor in naturally stimulating GLP-1 production — the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic. (Stevepb/Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide medications work by increasing the levels of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), a satiety signal that slows digestion and makes us feel full. These drugs also simultaneously decrease levels of an enzyme called DPP-4, which inactivates GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this "stop eating" hormone that naturally survives for only a few minutes can survive for an entire week. This enables a semi-permanent, just-eaten sensation of fullness that consequently leads to decreased food intake and, ultimately, weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, medications aren't the only way to raise GLP-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre – predominantly found in beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds – is the most notable nutrient that can significantly increase GLP-1. When fibre is fermented by the trillions of bacteria that live in our intestines, the resultant byproduct, called short chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao5774"&gt;stimulates the production of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may explain why fibre consumption is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxz117"&gt;strongest predictors of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz292"&gt;shown to enable weight loss&lt;/a&gt; even in the absence of calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monounsaturated fats – found in olive oil and avocado oil – are another nutrient that raises GLP-1. One study showed that GLP-1 levels were higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1135"&gt;following the consumption of bread and olive oil&lt;/a&gt; compared to bread and butter. Though notably, bread consumed with any kind of fat (be it from butter or even cheese) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;raises GLP-1 more than bread alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11050952"&gt;having an avocado&lt;/a&gt; alongside your breakfast bagel also increases GLP-1 more so than eating the bagel on its own. Nuts that are high in both fibre and monounsaturated fats, like pistachios, have also been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;shown to raise GLP-1 levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific foods and nutrients that influence GLP-1 levels are only half the story. GLP-1 is a good example of how it's not just what you eat that matters, it's also how you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that meal sequence – the order foods are eaten in – can impact GLP-1. Eating protein, like fish or meat, before carbohydrates, like rice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3841-z"&gt;results in a higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating carbohydrates before protein. Eating vegetables before carbohydrates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_704_20"&gt;has a similar effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161818" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg" alt="man eating salad" class="wp-image-161818 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The order of food and the timing of meals can all affect levels of GLP-1. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACmIUKTQC8/"&gt;Michal Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time of day also matters, because like all hormones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.991397"&gt;GLP-1 follows a circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. A meal eaten at 8 am stimulates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-0366"&gt;more pronounced release of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; compared to the same meal at 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may partly explain why the old saying "eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper" is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20460"&gt;backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates greater weight loss when breakfast is the largest meal of the day and dinner is the smallest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of eating can matter, too. Eating ice cream over 30 minutes has been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1018"&gt;produce a significantly higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating ice cream over five minutes. However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15051174"&gt;studies looking at blood sugar responses&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that if vegetables are eaten first, the speed of eating becomes less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even chewing matters. One study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58103-w"&gt;eating shredded cabbage raised GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; more than drinking pureed cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not as potent as medication&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While certain foods and dietary strategies can increase GLP-1 naturally, the magnitude is far less than what is achievable with medications. One study of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3406"&gt;GLP-1 raising effects of the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a peak GLP-1 level of approximately 59 picograms per millilitre of blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product monograph for Ozempic reports that the lowest dose &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209637lbl.pdf"&gt;produces a GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; of 65 nanograms per millilitre (one nanogram = 1,000 picograms). So medications raise GLP-1 more than one thousand times higher than diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when you compare long-term risk for diseases like heart attacks, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietitians.ca/DietitiansOfCanada/media/Documents/Mediterranean%20Diet%20Toolkit/Mediterranean-Diet-Toolkit-A-Guide-to-Healthy-Eating-(handout).pdf"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389"&gt;lowers risk of cardiac events by 30 per cent&lt;/a&gt;, outperforming GLP-1 medications that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;lower risk by 20 per cent&lt;/a&gt;. While weight loss will always be faster with medications, for overall health, dietary approaches are superior to medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following strategies are important for those trying to lose weight without a prescription:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to make breakfast the largest meal of the day (or at least frontload your day as much as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to eat at least one fibre-rich food at every meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make olive oil a dietary staple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of the order that you eat foods in, consume protein and vegetables before carbohydrates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chew your food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While natural approaches to raising GLP-1 may not be as potent as medications, they provide a drug-free approach to weight loss and healthy eating.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253728/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The United States on Friday approved the first blood test for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, a move that could help patients begin treatment earlier with newly approved drugs that slow the progression of the devastating neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test, developed by Fujirebio Diagnostics, measures the ratio of two proteins in the blood. The rato is correlated with amyloid plaques in the brain – a hallmark of Alzheimer's that, until now, has been detected only through brain scans or spinal fluid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease impacts too many people – more than breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and prostate cancer combined," &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Knowing that 10 percent of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two FDA approved treatments for Alzheimer's: lecanemab and donanemab, which target amyloid plaque and have been shown to modestly slow cognitive decline, though they do not cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the intravenous  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; therapies, including many neurologists, say they can offer patients a few additional months of independence – and are likely to be more effective if started earlier in the disease's course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical studies, the blood test produced results largely in line with positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans and spinal fluid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160391" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-642x260.jpg" alt="A Blood Marker Could Give Us a Decade of Early Warning For Some Alzheimer's Cases" class="wp-image-160391 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160391" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Per the FDA's announcment, the test measures two proteins found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. The method only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access than other more invasive techniques.

&lt;p&gt;The test is authorized for use in clinical settings for patients showing signs of cognitive decline, and results must be interpreted alongside other clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia. It worsens over time, gradually robbing people of their memories and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over time, too much sodium can increase your risk for high blood pressure, kidney problems, heart disease and stroke. So, it's often best to keep your sodium intake in a healthy range to protect your body from long-term complications. The American Heart Association recommends consuming 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium or less per day for most healthy adults and limiting intake to no more than 1,500 mg if you have high blood pressure. Yet, despite these recommendations, it’s estimated that the majority of Americans consume more than 3,400 mg of sodium daily on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while you don’t want to consume too much sodium, having some sodium in the diet is important for keeping electrolytes balanced—especially if you sweat often or exercise regularly, explains &lt;a href="https://www.realbodyfuel.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randy Evans, M.S., RDN, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Randy Evans, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Generally speaking, it's OK to salt your food when cooking, or eat naturally high-sodium foods in moderation. Here, dietitians share their picks of the best higher-sodium foods that are actually healthy for you. Just make sure to talk with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have been told to cut back on sodium in your diet for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Nuts, Seeds and Nut Butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts, seeds and nut butter can be salted during the manufacturing process, but that doesn’t mean you should avoid them. "I do generally recommend unsalted nuts, but nuts are so good for you in general that they are fine to eat either way," says &lt;a href="https://greenletes.com/about-me/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalie Rizzo, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalie Rizzo, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating walnuts daily can actually increase 'good' HDL cholesterol and positively affect blood sugar levels," she adds. Salted nuts and seeds also provide a boost of electrolytes, which may be helpful when hiking or after a tough, sweaty workout. Depending on the product, 1 ounce of mixed nuts contains about 87 mg of sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you prefer less sodium, look for "lower-sodium" or "50% less salt" varieties. Or, if you're &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263086/sweet-and-salty-roasted-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:roasting your own at home;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;roasting your own at home&lt;/a&gt;, use seasonings, like spice or garlic and herbs, in place of some of the salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sauerkraut and kimchi are fermented foods that are loaded with gut-healthy probiotics. However, to make these foods, you need a key ingredient: salt. Besides extending the shelf life of these products, salt is a key component for fermentation as it helps encourage the growth of good bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sodium content of kraut and kimchi may seem high at first—two tablespoons of Frank’s Kraut contains 180 mg of sodium—these foods are so flavorful that it’s easy to stick to a single serving, or less, per meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzo agrees, saying, “[These] tend to be the types of foods that you don't eat a large portion of in one sitting. Because of that, I definitely wouldn't worry about adding some kraut to your sandwich or some kimchi to your stir-fry." She adds, "The positive aspects definitely outweigh the salt here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other examples of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy fermented foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; include kefir, yogurt, kombucha, miso and tempeh, all of which vary in their sodium content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Olives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, Mediterranean diet! &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-olives-good-for-you-8714866" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Olives are a staple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Olives are a staple&lt;/a&gt; of this healthy eating pattern, thanks to their high antioxidant and monounsaturated fat content. They’re also naturally salty. "Olives are really nutritious, and Kalamata olives are one great option as they are packed with healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients," says Evans. "Adding olives to foods can boost the nutrient status while adding some extra healthy fat and a salty flavor," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 4 olives contain a whopping 248 mg of sodium, making them an easy way to add a punch of flavor to a salad or sandwich—just be mindful of the amount you choose and try to stick to one serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Canned Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time to whip out that canned tuna or salmon for lunch on the go! &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/protein-packed-breakfast-club/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says that while seafood naturally contains some sodium, canned seafood is often packaged with added salt to extend its shelf life. "A typical can contains 400 to 600 mg of sodium, which may seem high,” she says. However, Harris-Pincus notes that because “most Americans do not consume the recommended 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week,” the benefits of eating more fish may outweigh the higher sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an excellent source of anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, canned fish also provides protein, which can help you feel fuller longer after your meal. Overall, as long as you’re limiting ultra-processed foods, eating canned fish likely won’t take you overboard on sodium for the day, says Harris-Pincus. Just resist the urge to add salt to your tuna salad, since you’re already getting plenty from the can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283529/is-cottage-cheese-or-greek-yogurt-a-healthier-high-protein-snack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cottage cheese;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; is a good source of calcium and an excellent source of protein. But, depending on the variety, it can be high in sodium. However, Harris-Pincus says that you shouldn’t be overly concerned about the sodium content in cottage cheese as long as the rest of your meal or snack contains mostly whole foods that aren’t as salty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since adequate protein at breakfast is tough for most people to achieve, cottage cheese is a great option," she adds. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/savory-cottage-cheese-bowl-8763804" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:High-Protein Cottage Cheese Bowl;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;High-Protein Cottage Cheese Bowl&lt;/a&gt; for a savory, protein-packed start to your day. Or you can enjoy it as a salty snack post-workout to get back some of those electrolytes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-eat-cottage-cheese-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8383837" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Can You Eat Cottage Cheese if You Have High Blood Pressure?

A Dietitian Weighs In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Canned Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Personally, I always eat canned beans because they are an affordable and healthy plant-based protein," says Rizzo. However, depending on the variety, canned beans often contain sodium. "I always recommend rinsing them in cold water to remove some of the sodium," Rizzo says. "For those who need to watch their salt intake because of high blood pressure or kidney issues, they can opt for dried beans or low-sodium varieties," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you don’t need to limit salt for medical reasons, canned beans are a must-have in a healthy pantry: They’re high in protein and fiber, versatile, long-lasting and budget-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium plays a vital role in maintaining essential bodily functions, including hydration and electrolyte balance. While it's important to avoid overconsuming sodium to reduce the risk of health issues like high blood pressure and heart disease, enjoying it in moderation is beneficial, especially for athletes and active individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Striking the right balance involves being mindful of dietary sodium sources and making informed choices, such as opting for nutrient-dense, whole foods that may contain sodium.

'We were told 'you need to go home and pack a bag for William and yourself - we didn't know what that meant other than we knew one of the test results showed spots on his liver.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family went to the Emergency department at Westmead Children's Hospital and after speaking with a doctor they met with an Oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Smith has shared how at aged six her son William suffered from an upset stomach and appeared lethargic. Although these symptoms could easily have been a virus, she pushed for further investigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember him saying: 'I hope I'm the wrong doctor for you,' but explained that they needed to run more tests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially the team thought it was lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, and tests showed that William had several tumours throughout his body, the largest being on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The oncologist was showing the scans and was pointing out the tumours, they were all through his body. I just kept thinking how could there be this many tumours and we didn't know and how could there be this many tumours and William didn't know,' Danielle shared as her voice began to crack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went down the scan and said 'this is William's heart', he scrolled down and said, 'this is the tumour on the liver.' I asked him to scroll back up because the primary tumour was bigger than his heart. How could it be bigger than his heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is the moment that killed me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After having tests at the doctors, Danielle was told to pack a bag for her and her son and head to the hospital, where staff were waiting for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite learning that crushing information that would be impossible for any parent to hear, Danielle remained stoic and strong for William.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can't fall apart but so much happens so fast. When you've got your six-year-old who asks: 'Mum am I going to die?' — what do you say to your child in that moment? You have to protect your child and do the best you can. You just can't fall apart.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer that starts in the early nerve cells of the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William's cancer was stage 4, high-risk and aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 18 months after treatment had begun, William was finally finished, but then in a cruel twist, a scan showed another tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It fell into a pattern at that point, another scan, another tumour, another scan, another tumour. This went on for a while,' Danielle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2018 we were away on a holiday on the coast there was about 30 of us making memories together and I knew that something wasn't right. I noticed that one of his eyes had turned and he wasn't looking straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had scans booked when we got home and at that point the oncologist had asked William to stay in the waiting room and he told me to prepare myself, I knew what he was going to say.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was given 6 to 8 weeks. I had prepared myself that he was palliative, and I had got to a point but everything I had read said it would be six to eight months, so I assumed that we had that time. I can't even put that into words how I felt when I heard that prognosis. Pretty much eight weeks later he passed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tragically in early 2018 William passed away and the family were left devastated &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite knowing what was coming in those last eight weeks, if you were around him, you wouldn't have known, people couldn't believe he was so sick, he didn't let it show,' Danielle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During his gruelling treatment, William was happy to share his experience with other children and families who were going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was very open and willing to talk about his experience. He talked to other children at the hospital and was very willing to advocate on what he was going through. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and they would talk together about it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle and her two eldest children were inspired by William to help other children and their relatives who were battling cancer and raise funds for the Kids With Cancer charity by hosting the annual Gold Ribbon Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives purpose to why William was here. We would struggle to deal with something so terrible happening to us without it, so the three of us definitely use it as a healing technique and way of coping with our grief,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William's mum and siblings were inspired by him to help other families and fundraise for Kids with Cancer. To honour William's memory on what would have been his 16th birthday they are raising awareness for the charity's Care Pack 4 Kids campaign &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This month, to recognise what would have been William's 16th birthday, Danielle is raising awareness for the charity's &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kidswithcancer.org.au/care-packs-4-kids/"&gt;Care Packs 4 Kids campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bespoke gift boxes contain sweet and savoury snacks, puzzles and activities and a hand-written inspirational note. The packs are offered to oncology patients each time they attend a children's hospital across Australia.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Time in hospital is long and whether you're there for a day visit or a longer stay it's really hard to keep your child entertained. The care packs provide that bit of distraction but it also hits home that there is somebody out there that cares with the handwritten notes,' Danielle explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something so small can make a big difference and even if it's just for five minutes that the child forgets about their cancer or their treatment, it's like five years for the parents.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I think if William was with us today he's be joining in the fundraising, he'd probably be leading it and driving it. I think he'd be proud,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given what Danielle and her family went through, the Sydney mum is well placed to share advice to families who find themselves in a similar situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who might be going through a possible cancer diagnosis she said, 'My advice would be to advocate for your child and to voice how you feel, voice what your concerns are.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle admits it was 'hard' for her to accept help from others in the period following William's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took me a good few months to accept the support and to advocate for him and ask all of the questions.

Pesticides. Golf courses often use significant amounts of pesticides to maintain their pristine appearance. These chemicals can become airborne or leach into the groundwater, leading to increased exposure for nearby residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights concerns about water contamination. Residents who share a water source with a golf course, particularly those relying on groundwater, face nearly double the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease compared to those with separate water sources. This risk is even more pronounced in areas with vulnerable geological features, such as karst topography, which allows for easier movement of contaminants into the water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings underscore the need for public health policies aimed at reducing pesticide exposure, especially in residential areas near golf courses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing stricter regulations on pesticide use and improving water treatment processes could mitigate some of the risks identified in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti aging billionaire Bryan Johnson shared on X a screenshot of the study. "It's a good idea to routinely test the water you drink," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What pesticides are harmful?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to golf courses and Parkinson’s disease, the most concerning pesticides are those that have been scientifically linked to neurotoxicity — meaning they can damage or disrupt the nervous system. Here are the main culprits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraquat: Paraquat has been heavily linked to Parkinson’s disease in numerous studies. It kills plant cells through oxidative stress, and researchers believe it may do the same to neurons in the human brain — particularly those involved in motor control. It is banned in over 30 countries (including the EU and China), but still used in the U.S. under restricted conditions. "The US Environmental Protection Agency classifies paraquat as "restricted use."1 This means that it can be used only by people who have licenses. Because paraquat is highly poisonous, the United States requires the following safety measures: Blue dye is added to keep it from being confused with other beverages," the US CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chlorpyrifos: It is banned in the U.S. for food crops as of 2021, but may still be used on golf courses or in non-agricultural settings. It is known to disrupt neurotransmitter function, especially acetylcholine. Prenatal and long-term exposure is associated with developmental delays and neurological disorders. It is an organophosphate insecticide used to kill a range of insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maneb and Mancozeb (Dithiocarbamates): These are fungicides often used in landscaping, including on golf courses and are often studied in combination with Paraquat; exposure to both has shown to drastically increase Parkinson’s risk. These chemicals disrupt dopamine production — a key hormone depleted in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate: Although primarily linked to cancer (specifically non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), emerging research suggests glyphosate might also affect gut health and neurological function — both of which are closely linked to Parkinson’s. It is world’s most widely used herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case-control study included patients with incident PD and matched controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project from 1991 to 2015. Data were analyzed between June and August 2024. A total of 419 incident PD cases were identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么你的手和脚总是很冷，以及你的身体试图告诉你什么- AOL.com | Why Your Hands and Feet Are Always Cold—and What Your Body’s Trying To Tell You - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5mTlVIY1J5WEVWSFl2TjYxUzVUd2VkdjgwRm5hUGs2czV1WklXRzJ6c0ZrQXNydG1aeFU2enVVQjZCMXRKQnoyTFhWYS1yWjU3WVRGLVVzbjV3THVOR0xNN2tnN1RhUzBmQThlRFd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re lying on the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/shopping/soscana-4-seat-sectional-sofa-walmart-sale-may-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sofa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sofa&lt;/a&gt;, sitting at work or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1151185/ericasweeney/benefits-of-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; around outside, your hands and feet are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; cold.

Besides cold hands and feet, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21882-poor-circulation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you may notice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;you may notice&lt;/a&gt; muscles that hurt or feel weak when you walk, a “pins and needles” sensation, a pale or blue skin color, and numbness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When blood flow to the extremities is reduced, the body has a harder time keeping those areas warm,” explains &lt;a href="https://claya.com/our-medical-experts/#dr-jennifer-habashy-nmd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor and assistant medical director at Claya. She says poor circulation is “one of the more common reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What helps, Dr. Habashy continues, is staying active with &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/walking-10000-steps-a-day-for-a-month-results" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily movement&lt;/a&gt;, wearing warm socks or gloves and trying contrast hydrotherapy (so alternating warm and cold water on your hands and feet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Raynaud’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20363571" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raynaud’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Raynaud’s&lt;/a&gt; is when small blood vessels narrow in response to cold temperatures or stress. Signs include areas of skin turning white then blue, and a numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming up or easing stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is it’s treatable. “With Raynaud’s or circulation-related issues, keep warm, avoid smoking, limit caffeine and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/997659/nicolepajer/stress-relief/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manage stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Khanna says. To manage stress, he recommends cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1036167/marijkevroomendurning/what-is-mindfulness/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mindfulness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1072693/jenniferlarson/rare-autoimmune-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hypothyroidism.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hypothyroidism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/a&gt; is an underactive thyroid. But how does that affect the temperature of your hands and feet? Dr. Habashy says it’s “where a sluggish thyroid slows down metabolic activity, reducing the body’s ability to generate heat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs include fatigue, weight gain, joint and muscle pain, constipation, dry skin, thinning hair and more. “Cold intolerance is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in hypothyroidism,” Dr. Khanna adds. “I always check for this.” To determine if you have this condition, these doctors recommend getting a full thyroid panel at your doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anemia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anemia&lt;/a&gt; is a common blood disorder in which a person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, or the ones they have don’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1229513/shameikarhymes/iron-infusion-for-anemia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anemia is also a frequent contributor, as low iron levels impair oxygen delivery to tissues, which can make the extremities feel cold,” Dr. Kabashy explains. Additional signs include weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, headache, chest pain and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition needs to be assessed by your primary care provider, Dr. Khanna says, who can order a CBC (AKA, a complete blood count) test and iron studies. He and Dr. Habashy also recommend addressing the nutritional side of things; make sure you &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1143900/shameikarhymes/foods-high-in-iron/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:get enough iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;get enough iron&lt;/a&gt;, B12 and folate in your diet.

So, remember to eat those foods listed above. You can also get labs to assess which nutrients you’re deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent cold hands and feet aren’t always something to brush off,” she concludes. “Paying attention to your patterns (and getting the right testing) can help uncover the root cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1339453/emily-laurence/toe-cramps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Ouch!

commonly referred to as the 'paisa mutation' - has been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2897185/The-village-residents-dementia-age-40-Genetic-mutation-marrying-families-means-Yamural-curse-spiralling-control.html"&gt;passed down by a gene from a single common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; to an extended lineage of 6,000 people in the town and it &lt;font&gt;causes Alzheimer's in nearly every person that has it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Located on the 14th chromosome, it leads to a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leaves patients suffering from crippling dementia. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Those who have the mutation also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as early as their 30s.&lt;/font&gt; In the US, the average age is 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, after decades of misery, one person's unique genetic mutation could hold the secret to a cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennie Erin Smith, author of &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Valley of Forgetting: Alzheimer's Families and the Search for a Cure&lt;/span&gt;, followed University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik and Colombian neuroscientist Dr Francisco Lopera as they spent four decades studying Yarumal residents - until they stumbled upon Aliria Rosa Piedrahita de Villegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Piedrahita de Villegas, who died at 77 from cancer, was born and raised in Yarumal and had the paisa mutation. However, she spent her entire life without being afflicted by Alzheimer's,&lt;span&gt; even &lt;/span&gt;as her younger family members were plagued by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A perplexing case, scientists eventually learned that not only did she have the dementia gene, she had another mutation that actually safeguarded her from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thousands of residents in Yarumal, a quaint town, have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease - showing signs in their 30s and 40s, dying in their 50s - all due to a genetic mutation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, experts believe if they are able to understand and replicate the mysterious protective effect observed in Piedrahita de Villegas's brain, they might be able to prevent the development of the disease in other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kosik recalled: 'She was so fascinating because she had this mutation that just inevitably leads to Alzheimer's disease and here she was, 70-something years old and still fine.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through her participation in the team's research and her family's willingness to donate her brain after her death in 2020, both neuroscientists have been able to make significant progress in understanding&lt;span&gt; potential cures for a disease that affects about 44million people globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects older adults. About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The illness begins due to the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid protein molecules stick together in the brain cells, forming clumps called plaques. Tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The World Health Organization predicts 115million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Pictured is a brain scan of a 74-year-old patient with the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no cure but doctors can prescribe treatments and therapies to try and ease symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik believes he may have now uncovered previously unknown clues as to how Piedrahita de Villegas managed to evade the disease while her entire family succumbed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the UCSB neuroscientist, investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital found Piedrahita de Villegas's brain had exceptionally large quantities of amyloid protein but nearly no tau protein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the lack of tau protein, her brain didn't develop the hallmark tangles of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One clue that appeared when researchers examined her brain tissue [was] while Aliria had the same overproduction of plaques that the rest of her family had, the tangles of misfolded tau protein that typically accompany the plaques in Alzheimer's patients in her were relatively scant, keeping intact things like motor skills and executive function.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the paisa mutation, the team also found her DNA carried two copies of another rare gene mutation called &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3#Abs1"&gt;apolipoprotein or APOE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A single parent can pass down the mutation, located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leave patients suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the Christchurch mutation, the APOE gene variant allowed her body to produce lipoproteins that protected her brain from Alzheimer's disease by counteracting the effects of the amyloid protein-caused plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lipoproteins are molecules made of proteins and fats in the body and they carry cholesterol through the bloodstream to cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two main groups of lipoproteins are called HDL (high-density lipoprotein) or 'good' cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or 'bad' cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists are hoping this discovery can lead to treatments or preventatives therapies for people with or at risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: 'The probability of one rare mutation is very small, but a person with two exceptionally rare mutations in the setting of an Alzheimer's rare mutation, how unlikely is that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'She was a very important patient; her story made news all over the world. We learned a lot from her - and now that she's died, it's on us to make sure we give it a careful look.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your diet and overall lifestyle play a key role in your health across your lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and minerals support healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of these convenient and affordable healthy-aging staples are likely on your pantry shelves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pantry food items can make meal prep and planning more convenient, cost-effective and nutritious (when you have the right ingredients). What you eat regularly has a significant impact on your health. Qianzhi Jiang, RD, Ph.D., says, “A nutrient-dense eating plan that emphasizes plant-based food sources is associated with lower mortality and healthier longevity.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary choices directly and indirectly impact your quality of life. “Good nutrition supports continued energy, mood, digestion and sleep quality—all things that contribute to a better quality of life, especially as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amy Shapiro, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating for longevity means choosing foods that improve your lifespan and your “health span.” Jiang says, “As a health expert, I look at years spent in good health and with a high quality of life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We have a certain level of control over our health as we age, which can be very empowering. &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, says, “About 75% of our health span is determined by our lifestyle choices, not our genetics.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try not to be overwhelmed by this and instead focus on starting small; a few tweaks to your pantry might be just the right place to get started.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-walnuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Walnuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that walnuts are shaped like mini brains. “Studies have linked regular walnut consumption with lower inflammation and better cognitive aging,” says Shapiro.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon adds, “A clinical trial found that eating one to two handfuls of walnuts a day may slow cognitive decline for older adults, especially those with limited access to healthy foods.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moon also says that eating walnuts in midlife may help stave off early brain changes that lead to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jiang always stocks seaweed in her pantry for snacks or cooking. “Low in calories, but packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and polysaccharides, seaweeds can assist in lowering the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon notes that seaweed is a vegetarian option for consuming omega-3s: “Those omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and literally part of the structure of healthy brain cells that face greater challenges as we get older.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain a variety of health-boosting nutrients, including plant-based protein, fiber and vitamins and minerals. They also contain polyphenols, plant-based compounds that have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Beans are a staple in areas like the Blue Zones; they help regulate blood sugar and support a healthy gut,” says Shapiro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Extra-virgin olive oil is a key ingredient in the Mediterranean diet. It is naturally rich in monounsaturated fat and polyphenols. Shapiro notes, “The combination of healthy fat and polyphenols supports healthy cholesterol levels and reduces inflammation.” The Food and Drug Administration supports eating 1.5 tablespoons (20 grams) of olive oil each day to help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber. “Clinical trials suggest eating chia seeds improves high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which contribute to accelerated signs of aging in midlife and older adulthood,” says Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prunes contain essential nutrients for keeping bones strong, including vitamin K, boron, calcium, magnesium and phenolic compounds. Moon says, “Prunes provide several nutrients that build strong bones, which is especially important for mobility and independence later in life; they have fiber and gut microbial byproducts that help bones absorb calcium.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, the fiber in prunes can support regular bowel movements and contribute to digestive health, notes Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A plant-based source of vitamin B12, nutritional yeast adds a natural cheesy flavor without added fat or sodium. Having low levels of B12 can accelerate cellular aging, and higher rates of deficiency are seen among older people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shapiro recommends adding nutritional yeast to popcorn, salad dressings and grains as a replacement for foods high in saturated fat like cheese.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sharing conversation with a cup of tea is a nice way to connect with friends. Drinking tea can serve as a great tool for relaxing, too. But it is not just the act of drinking; green tea contains nutrients that can reduce stress and support cognitive health. Moon says, “Green tea provides bioactives known to promote blood flow to the part of the brain that helps us manage stress. It also has a blend of caffeine and L-theanine to help the brain stay alert but calm.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small but mighty, herbs and spices add flavor and color to any meal. We love turmeric and parsley for their components which support brain and heart health. Moon says, “Turmeric’s active ingredient, curcumin, is part of the brain’s cleanup crew, sweeping away extra protein clumps that may lead to cognitive decline. Turmeric is associated with reduced cortisol and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may be how it supports learning and memory.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon also notes that consuming parsley as part of an overall healthy eating plan can provide flavonoids that are associated with a decrease in risk of stroke, a common contributing factor to cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tinned fish are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that play a role in reducing inflammation and supporting brain health. “Eating tinned fish once a week checks off one of the MIND diet guidelines, which overall has been associated with a 53% reduced risk of Alzheimer’s and a 7.5-year younger brain, as well as a slowdown in cognitive decline with aging.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro notes that smaller fish, such as sardines, contain calcium in the bones. Calcium is an important nutrient for aging as it supports bone health. She also loves them for their convenience, cost and powerful anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Incorporate tinned fish into your salads, sandwiches or grains for a versatile, filling and nutrient-dense meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; half of the grains you consume daily be whole grains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains contain vitamins, minerals and fiber. Shapiro’s favorites are oats, quinoa and farro: “These provide fiber for gut health, B vitamins for energy, and steady-release carbohydrates to stabilize blood sugar and support long-term metabolic health.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to a nutritious diet, “A healthy lifestyle can help extend your lifespan by 8 to 10 years,” says Jiang. Daily movement is incredibly important for preserving lean body mass, bone health and balance. As we age, having strong muscles and bones can prevent falls. Shapiro says, “Include regular movement and activity into your day. Especially walking, strength training and mobility work, which support muscle mass, heart health and mental well-being.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social connection can prevent loneliness and is another important lifestyle habit that can improve and increase your health span. “Prioritize connection and relationships. Strong social bonds and a sense of purpose are shown to promote longevity,” says Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Longevity refers to living a long life and enjoying quality of life throughout your years, including good health, independence and vitality. It is not just about adding years to your life, but adding life to your years,” says Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get started by stocking your pantry with easy-to-use, convenient and affordable ingredients. Consuming pantry items that are rich in fiber, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to overall health.

&lt;p&gt;Although people might not often talk about peeing-related problems, there are lots of common bladder health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incontinence (or ‘leaky bladder’) that accidentally loses urine when you don’t want it to is the most common bladder issue in individuals,” explained &lt;a href="https://yourfavoriteurologist.com/my-story/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Fenwa Milhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified urologist and specialist in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. “Frequent urination is also a very common complaint in individuals, and can be especially bothersome when this occurs at night or while sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, is a long-term condition that causes pain and discomfort in the bladder, which is often irritated, or in the pelvic area. There’s also a sensation of needing to pee often and urgently. “When patients are experiencing overactive bladder or symptoms of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, our first recommendation is to limit bladder irritants,” Ackerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that changing up your diet may reduce your issues. “Often diet alone and elimination of bladder irritants will control the patient’s symptoms,” Ackerman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you have a healthy bladder, knowing what foods and drinks are irritants will be beneficial. “Awareness of foods and beverages that can cause irritation can be helpful to prevent bladder symptoms for those that are not currently having concerns,” said &lt;a href="https://aeroflowurology.com/aleece-fosnight" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aleece Fosnight&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician assistant specializing in women’s health and urology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, urologists and medical experts share the foods and drinks that you should limit or avoid for a healthy bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love your morning cup or three of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/coffee" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;? You may rely on it to wake up and stay alert, but your bladder may not be so happy. Coffee contains a couple of irritants ― caffeine and acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The caffeine in coffee is a known diuretic, meaning it makes you produce more urine, increasing bladder frequency,” Milhouse explained. “Caffeine has also been observed to increase the urgency of urination, making it harder to control your bladder and more likely to have bladder leaks.” Ackerman added that “acidic foods and drinks can be irritating and also exacerbate these symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to give up your brew just yet, Milhouse said coffee and tea can be enjoyed in moderation. “If you have no bladder issues, two 8-ounce cups of coffee or less is ideal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who already deal with pain or frequent urination might need to limit or eliminate coffee until symptoms subside. “Avoiding coffee altogether may be necessary for some individuals who struggle with overactive bladder or bladder pain,” Milhouse said.&lt;/p&gt;

The “world-first discovery” published in the journal Cell Reports challenges the widely held belief that pathogens cannot degrade medical plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means any medical device or treatment that contains plastic could be susceptible to degradation by bacteria, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the study, said, “It means we need to reconsider how pathogens exist in the hospital environment.” Plastics, including plastic surfaces, could potentially be food for these bacteria. Pathogens with this ability could survive for longer in the hospital environment, he added. McCarthy and his team isolated the enzyme Pap1 from a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa that was originally sampled from a patient’s wound. Tested in a lab, the enzyme degraded 78% of a plastic sample in just seven days. Crucially, the bacteria could also use plastic as its only carbon source — effectively eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among a bacteria group responsible for most hospital infections that can resist antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="js_tbl_readmore_btn" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 20:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxQaGk0b3Jrb2FaNVBuMlV3VDQ3OWVsYWhxWnVUNFRyWW1wMm8xQVNVRWsySm5TalNyRXUyQmdEZGQtRXVVWjBsNHNac0JCbDlRQzh1d1hLb0J3RC1fQ2xUU1dOenEzTXJ2RkZGVGFIQTJPSHl6bzBFYk1JRUs2VHFmcDJyMTBuYmNKWUxXMEVjLV9QdGdhTWwtVkNVclJ0WEJCMW04THNCN3ktNGRIUkppUlJvd3p6TTlTZ1gtcFJhUDVUaTYxd3psWUU4N2U</guid></item><item><title>在美国，每4个孩子中就有1个家长与成瘾作斗争- Newser | In US, 1 in 4 Kids Has Parent Struggling With Addiction - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQZkRPNV9SdVF1Zld4dlJ5S2JHak5BaVk1akp4Ukhsb1VvTVNyT1lIWnFUTWFGTTA4NnNOUVlpbTZWaVZZTkpMODlFcF9WUU5zNjVtNDlsSEM3RG90cXB1akRSRXFNdUF6NzZkZWw5R3lPb1BYZVYwQlpEeWJzNEo0ajl1aDJlSzlOekhxX3k3SFlWZGczbGtUNkpFUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2833575#:~:text=Parental%20SUDs%20consisted%20of%20alcohol,drug%20use%20disorders%20(Figure).&amp;amp;text=Nearly%2019%20million%20children%20were,all%20US%20children%20in%202023."&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that nearly 19 million US children under the age of 18—about 1 in 4—live with at least one parent with a substance use disorder, a figure notably higher than earlier estimates that relied on older diagnostic criteria. This study used data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, per &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5393935/quarter-children-have-parent-substance-use-disorder-study"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Of those 19 million kids, 7.6 million have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction, and 3.4 million live with a parent dealing with multiple substance-use disorders. Authors also found that more than 6 million children have a parent dealing with both a substance use disorder and a mental health condition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Most parental substance-use disorders identified in the study involve alcohol, which remains the main cause of substance-related deaths in the US, per Dr. Scott Hadland, adolescent medicine chief at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Experts say exposure to parental addiction can place children at increased risk for physical accidents, mental health conditions, and developing substance use problems themselves. Barriers to accessing care, including stigma, mean that most parents with a substance use disorder don't seek treatment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Hadland notes that these findings mean pediatricians need to be especially vigilant in screening families and connecting them to treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine screening for substance use within families, and many clinics now ask about parental substance use as part of developmental screenings.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; The future of the survey from which the data was culled, meanwhile, is unclear following a recent workforce reduction. Per a &lt;a href="https://news.umich.edu/1-in-4-kids-live-with-parents-who-have-alcohol-other-drug-problems-u-m-study-finds/"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, the survey's entire staff was laid off in April due to budget cuts at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (This content was created with the help of AI.

&lt;p&gt;They’re lovin’ it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People on TikTok are claiming that a specific &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/lifestyle/mcdonalds-launches-top-tier-new-mcflurry-flavor-to-celebrate-desserts-30th-anniversary-but-theres-a-catch/"&gt;McDonald’s order&lt;/a&gt; is helping cure their migraines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “migraine meal” is a large Coca-Cola drink and an order of large fries — and many&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/health/doctor-reveals-how-to-prevent-and-manage-headaches-migraine/"&gt; sufferers&lt;/a&gt; online can’t get enough of this combo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@millyhancockk/video/7503985153090342166" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; — with over 3 million views — shows a girl at the fast food chain’s drive-thru with overlay text reading, “Trying McDonald’s chips [fries] and a Diet Coke because I’ve had a headache for 48 hours and TikTok said it would help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the comments on the video chimed in praising this cure.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s just the salt and caffeine but every time I have a migraine or even one coming on I get a coke and a fry and it’s immediately cured,” one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s my go to!! I take my migraine meds, sip a Diet Coke, and as my pain goes away, I crave salt…” a comment read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not Diet Coke!!! Full sugar Coke + ibuprofen + something salty,” another person advised. &lt;/p&gt;

comment section of a viral TikTok video. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Diet Coke works on headaches, I don’t understand it , considering a coffee makes it worse,” a confused commenter chimed in, writing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any sort of “hack” — especially a health one — seen online always has to be taken with a grain of salt. However, this one in particular might be worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in the Coke has pain relief properties, especially when used simultaneously with other pain relievers like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know the caffeine can help migraines in the short-term therapy of them. So it isn’t too surprising that the caffeine in Coca-Cola itself is helpful,” Dr. David Walker, MD, told &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/mcmigraine-11727032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rarely are people told that salty foods can actually do the body some good — but in this case, salty fries for the win.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Since migraines are often caused by “a deficiency of minerals such as sodium,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mcdonalds-order-tiktok-claims-cure-163000602.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEjddFThkZVq_4U6uxRdal3PFd3FJQ33UoEwa5sB5SVtP14R14Q7tAM9XHtn-H10nmuvx-fimyzDJQagHrxLlbtY_81KOOGkdOhh27F62OlEoZ9W4OroUhUzo_r7yteqrBV9V3Sc_uEdkNRxl2_fjmIwOwQwg-wUwu5D91tr-LLn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Yahoo! Life&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/lifestyle/the-5-worst-fast-foods-for-your-health-that-you-should-avoid-at-all-costs/?preview_id=35376074&amp;amp;_thumbnail_id=35376620"&gt;salt on the fries &lt;/a&gt;can supposedly act as a source of electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that everyone’s body is different and migraines vary from person to person, so this hack night not be the cure-all for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This treat meal is not the worst idea from time to time, if it can help relieve a headache or migraine — just don’t make your McDonald’s run a habit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone finds that they improve with this hack, that’s great for them,” Dr. Matthew Robbins told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/migraine-meal-hack-neurologists-explain-rcna206858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;. “But if they’re using it often, that’s not good for you either.”&lt;/p&gt;

The research found that these early experiences are not only linked to a child’s outcomes, but also shape the environment in which a child is raised—by affecting socioeconomic status, maternal mental health, relationship conflict, and caregiving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers undertook this study to better understand how adversity experienced during a mother’s early years can ripple forward into the next generation. While previous studies have found that childhood adversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes in adulthood, much less is known about how these effects play out in parenting and early child development. The study aimed to test an intergenerational model of risk by examining both direct and indirect pathways from maternal childhood adversity to child outcomes during the preschool years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed 501 families from the time children were 2 months old until they reached 5 years of age. Participants were recruited in the Toronto area between 2006 and 2008. Mothers reported on their own adverse childhood experiences (including physical and sexual abuse, household substance use, mental illness, parental separation, and exposure to violence), as well as their current socioeconomic conditions, relationship conflict, and symptoms of depression. Fathers contributed information on their own childhood conduct problems, and trained observers assessed parenting behaviors. Children’s emotional and behavioral issues were rated by both parents, and cognitive abilities were measured through standardized testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that a mother’s history of childhood adversity was linked to her child’s emotional and behavioral problems, as well as cognitive performance. However, these associations were not straightforward. Instead, the effects were often indirect, operating through a network of interconnected family and contextual factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, mothers who had experienced more adversity in childhood were more likely to live in lower socioeconomic conditions as adults. This, in turn, was related to lower maternal sensitivity—how attuned and responsive mothers were to their children during interactions—and also linked to greater marital conflict and maternal depression. These factors shaped children’s outcomes in specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s emotional problems, such as anxiety and sadness, were primarily linked to maternal depression. Mothers with more childhood adversity were more likely to experience depression, and this was a key predictor of emotional difficulties in their children. Fathers’ histories of conduct problems also contributed indirectly to maternal depression, strengthening this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For conduct problems in children—such as aggression and rule-breaking—multiple pathways emerged. One involved fathers’ own histories of behavior problems, which were directly associated with children’s behavior. Another pathway went through the couple’s relationship: maternal childhood adversity predicted more marital conflict, which was in turn linked to conduct issues in children. Lower maternal sensitivity also played a role in this association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive outcomes followed a different pathway. Here, maternal sensitivity emerged as a key influence. Mothers with more childhood adversity tended to have lower socioeconomic status, which was associated with less sensitive caregiving. In turn, children in these environments showed poorer performance on measures of vocabulary and early math ability. Interestingly, maternal adversity showed a small direct link to higher child cognitive scores, but this was likely a statistical artifact. Once indirect pathways were considered, the overall effect of adversity on cognition was negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support an “interactionist model” of development. In this model, a mother’s early adversity can influence her adult socioeconomic status and the characteristics of her romantic partner, which then affect her mental health and caregiving behavior. These, in turn, shape her child’s development. The model highlights how early life experiences can create cascades of risk that accumulate over time and generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study cannot prove causation, its design strengthens confidence in the findings. By including multiple informants (mothers, fathers, and trained observers) and multiple measurement methods (questionnaires, behavioral observations, and standardized tests), the researchers were able to paint a more complete picture than many earlier studies that relied solely on maternal self-reports. The longitudinal design, spanning several years of a child’s early development, also allowed the researchers to track how these effects unfolded over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study is its focus on mothers. While the researchers did incorporate paternal conduct history, they did not collect data on fathers’ own childhood adversity. Future studies could explore whether fathers’ early experiences also shape intergenerational risk in similar or distinct ways. Another limitation is that the adversity measures did not include some potentially important forms of early trauma, such as community violence or discrimination. Also, maternal ACEs, mental health, and relationship conflict were all self-reported, which may introduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has significant implications for public policy and early intervention. The findings suggest that childhood adversity is not just an individual problem but one that can affect future generations. Policies that aim to reduce childhood trauma or mitigate its effects could have broad, long-lasting benefits. For example, programs that support young families with financial resources, mental health services, and parenting support may help break the cycle of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening tools for adverse childhood experiences are relatively easy to administer and could be incorporated into pediatric and maternal healthcare settings. Identifying families at risk could allow for early, targeted support. Moreover, addressing multiple factors at once—such as economic hardship, caregiver mental health, and parenting quality—may be more effective than focusing on any single issue in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also supports the potential value of broader social policies, such as cash transfer programs, to alleviate economic stress. Preliminary research has found that unconditional financial support to families can lead to improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children. High-quality, affordable childcare may also help buffer the effects of family stress on young children’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The long reach of adversity: Intermediary pathways from maternal adverse childhood experiences to child socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sheri Madigan, Andre Plamondon, and Jennifer M.

Oxygen, combined with the lingering moisture in the bathroom, creates an environment that corrodes the blades at an accelerated pace and makes you more prone to nicks and cuts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as concerning is the &lt;a href="https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/microban-research-finds-nearly-5-million-bacteria-single-wet-razor-handle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:4.9 million bacteria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;4.9 million bacteria&lt;/a&gt; researchers have also found on a wet razor handle. That, combined with contaminated blades, have been known to irritate the skin and cause infections. "I’ve had patients come in with inflamed razor bumps or folliculitis, and more often than not, it’s linked to poor razor hygiene," Dr. Kopelman explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Dupati says the moist environment is a hotbed for bacteria to multiply and thrive. Though it's not just with hot showers. He says the moist environment from both hot and cold showers increases bacteria that linger on razors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1277699/ericasweeney/tiktok-leg-shaving-hack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Does the Famous TikTok Leg-Shaving Hack Actually Work?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Does the Famous TikTok Leg-Shaving Hack Actually Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Dermatologists Recommend You Do Instead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After using your razor, Dr. Kopelman recommends rinsing the razor off thoroughly and then drying it off with a towel. You'll then want to store it somewhere dry and outside the bathroom. If you want to keep it in the bathroom, place it in a cabinet or a drawer. "It keeps the blades sharper longer and cuts down on skin issues," she adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To further prevent skin infections from lingering bacteria, Dr. Dupati says to apply after-shave lotion and a gentle moisturizer after drying off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/top-shower-habit-to-break-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The No. 1 Shower Habit to Break, According to Doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The No. 1 Shower Habit to Break, According to Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on that note, how often should you replace your razor? If you're using a reusable razor, Dr. Dupati and Dr. Kopelman advise changing the blade after five to seven shaves. Though you'll want to throw it out sooner if you notice rust, the blade is pulling on your hair or if it feels rough on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/shower-benefits-when-you-dont-skip-this-important-step" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: You're Undoing All Your Shower Benefits When You Skip This Important Step;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: You're Undoing All Your Shower Benefits When You Skip This Important Step&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 17:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9YelBERWlfLU13cGJXaFdGQ1RyUEd5dktVREM3anQ2QUJUVE1UcUsySnl3N2JfdFZwRnJieHp1YVhVNlRCQlBaQ2FiUDRXZFVjZXBGamI5S1NiVG9vTGZsUjZBSGp3QUdaNDU3Y2p0WHF6TmVlUUNTc080WnBvZw</guid></item></channel></rss>
