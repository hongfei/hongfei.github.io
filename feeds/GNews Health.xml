Ashland.news photo by Bob Palermini&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;His colleague, Baures, was setting a trap this week and found one sitting on a leaf and snapped a photo of it. So far, the duo haven’t seen high numbers of aegypti compared to last year in Talent, though none have been found in Talent this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Partin and Baures said last summer’s public awareness campaign to stamp out aegypti in Talent has paid off, and they’re hoping for the same response in Ashland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a huge cultural shift in Talent,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent was the first area in Oregon where aegypti were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they prefer human blood, the aegypti are most active during the day and are aggressive biters, feeding on ankles, wrists and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can lay larvae in 1/4-inch of standing water.  Marsha MacCormack, who lives near Clay Street, let Partin and Baures set up traps in her shady backyard with a creek flowing through the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jackson County Vector Ecologist Andrew Partin and technician Joe Baures were in Ashland on Thursday morning to collect traps they had deployed on Wednesday.

The netting is pulled out and placed into a plastic bag, where it is frozen back at the lab so it can be inspected. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the canister and a small scent device adds extra enticement for the aegypti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s supposed to mimic how an organism, in this case a human, helps attract the mosquitoes,” Baures said.  The mosquitoes prefer older, established neighborhoods with shade trees and more vegetated backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aegypti were found in California for the first time in 2013, and by 2020, they were discovered in Redding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2022, the aegypti have exploded in Redding,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mosquito Control employees put hang cards on neighborhood doors to warn of the presence of day-biting mosquitoes.

Davis sponsors summer internship programs, which helped to train Baures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilio DeBess, state public health veterinarian in the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, said aegypti’s discovery in Oregon is a concern because the species has been more common in much warmer climates of the United States, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mosquitoes have been known carry and transmit diseases that are more typical to warmer climates, such as Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever,” DeBess said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, DeBess emphasized that the risk of these infections to local residents is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acquiring these diseases depends on the presence or arrival of someone who is currently infected with one of the diseases after infection outside the United States,” DeBess said in a news release. “As was the case when Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were first found in Oregon in 2024, there have been no reports of anyone having acquired viruses associated with Ae. aegypti from within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Staying safe&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;Residents can take these steps to help prevent the spread of aegypti:&lt;br&gt;    • Dumping or draining any standing water around the home.&lt;br&gt;    • Removing containers or objects that can hold water from your yard, such as water saucers from under plants, old tires, tarps, buckets, containers, toys, and other equipment.&lt;br&gt;    • Repairing leaky outdoor faucets.&lt;br&gt;    • Keeping rain gutters cleared.&lt;br&gt;    • Covering, screening, or removing rain barrels, trashcans, bins, buckets, or tubs.&lt;br&gt;    • Wearing mosquito repellent outside. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, some lemon eucalyptus, and para-menthane-diol products are most effective at preventing mosquito bites.&lt;br&gt;    • Sleeping under a mosquito net when outside or in a room without screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach freelance writer Damian Mann at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e2a232f2020202b393d0e29232f2722602d2123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2b6bfb3bcbcbcb7a5a192b5bfb3bbbefcb1bdbf"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related story: &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/oregon-officials-find-mosquito-that-can-transmit-deadly-viruses-in-southern-oregon/"&gt;Oregon officials find mosquito that can transmit deadly viruses in Southern Oregon&lt;/a&gt; (Aug. 31, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ashland News</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE91VTBHOWRnejhYTUMyTlI2TngwdGdIc0w5ZnlXLUVfb3BpY2QxQ0pMQnUxejN6OHVXOXRmazJQX0t3d1RjdFhjNFl3LWdySS1pYWJVeXo5Y1JVNU5fY3V3NEd6RGIzaFkyVU4wVGtVVnJLZw</guid></item><item><title>关于一项关于锂和阿尔茨海默病的新研究的4件事- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/4-things-to-know-about-a-new-study-on-lithium-and-alzheimers-disease</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A recent study from Harvard Medical School asks whether the element lithium might be a key factor in whether someone develops Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, the almost-decade long study says it is the first to show that lithium is found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02471-4"&gt;naturally&lt;/a&gt; in the brain in small amounts and suggests that the element plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; this month found a link between lithium deficiency in the brain and an increase in amyloid plaques and tau tangles — known contributors to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss through a small dosage of a lithium compound called lithium orotate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;

    &lt;p class="pullquote__quote"&gt;In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts told PBS News that it’s premature to conclude from the results that people should use lithium as a treatment or prophylactic for Alzheimer’s disease — but if the findings are confirmed through a randomized human controlled trial, measuring lithium levels could potentially help with early detection of the disease and provide a broader understanding of aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that if lithium worked out, it might actually restore function, not only change the slope of decline. It certainly does that in the advanced mouse models,” Yankner said. “So I’m optimistic, but we have to hold judgment until we see what happens in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is lithium and how is it used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/ethnic-and-cultural-studies/lithium-li"&gt;Lithium&lt;/a&gt; is a naturally occurring element in the same family as sodium and potassium. The alkali metal is soft and silvery, and used for a variety of purposes, from nuclear power to ceramics, but most famously in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/water-domestic-lithium-mining"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How demand for lithium batteries could drain America’s water resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal has also been used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712976/"&gt;mood stabilizer&lt;/a&gt; for people with bipolar and other mood disorders since the 1900s. &lt;a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/lithium.htm"&gt;7 Up sodas&lt;/a&gt; even contained lithium citrate from 1929 to the 1940s, until the FDA banned the compound from all soda and beer due to reports of overuse leading to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Making_Medicine/NvJjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=FDA+banned+lithium+in+beer+and+soft+drinks&amp;amp;pg=PA42&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;lithium toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies have considered lithium as a factor in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832877/"&gt;Danish study&lt;/a&gt; found there was a possible link between lower rates of dementia in certain regions of Denmark and “microlevels” of lithium in the drinking water, suggesting “even exposure to slightly higher lithium levels over a longer period of time can have a potentially major impact on dementia,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the study found about lithium&lt;/h2&gt;

The authors of a recent medical paper in Nature found that lithium may help protect against brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; used postmortem brain tissue from the Memory and Aging Project by Rush University in Chicago, donated by thousands of study participants ranging across all levels of the cognitive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced tools that could detect trace amounts of metals in the brain and blood — something that older machines were not sensitive enough to do in the past — Yankner’s team found that donors with mild impairment and advanced Alzheimer’s had lower lithium levels compared to cognitively healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors with early signs of memory loss, “the lithium levels were one of the first things to drop,” Yankner said. “And also full-blown Alzheimer’s disease, we saw a few metals had changed, just as other people had seen. But the most significant change was actually in this natural level of lithium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also experimented with restricting the lithium intake of normal mice and Alzheimer’s mice – mice that model Alzheimer genes found in humans. They found that in healthy mice, a lithium-deficient diet accelerated cognitive decline, loss of synaptic connections between neurons and memory loss. In the Alzheimer’s mice, the formation of amyloid plaques – clumps of sticky protein that disrupt brain function that are trademarks of Alzheimer’s disease – was accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-a-mouse-watching-the-matrix-helped-scientists-create-the-largest-map-of-a-brain-to-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How a mouse watching ‘The Matrix’ helped scientists create the largest map of a brain to date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner and his colleagues discovered that lithium gets depleted in the brain when amyloid plaques bind to the metal, which reduces the lithium’s availability to other necessary brain functions, like microglia cells that mount immune responses and repair damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglias are the “scavengers or macrophages of the brain,” Yankner said, and one of their key functions is to clear the amyloid plaques. The researchers discovered that in a lithium-deficient brain, microglia were not able to perform their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tried out various lithium compounds on the mice. The amyloid plaques were found to bind to lithium carbonate, the compound commonly prescribed for mood disorders, making it less effective in preventing the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous clinical trials, lithium carbonate had shown some efficacy in fighting the disease, but the high dosage used can be toxic to older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium orotate, which is currently marketed as a dietary supplement for people, avoided being bound by the amyloid plaques in the study by Yankner’s team. Using a dose of lithium orotate on mice at &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;one-thousandth&lt;/a&gt; the clinical dose of lithium carbonate showed to be the most effective treatment so far for reversing memory loss in the studied animals without causing toxicity, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can taking a lithium supplement prevent Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t start taking a lithium supplement just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice studies do not always reflect human trials, according to Rachel Whitmer, professor of public health sciences and neurology at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“How you translate to applying that experiment [in mice] to humans is more complicated and takes longer, but with the right planning, it can absolutely happen and it can absolutely be successful,” said Whitmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner added that his team is exploring “whether lithium orotate is the best we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using the screening approach and platform we’ve developed, we might even be able to find a better lithium compound,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, said it is too early for people to alter their diets or use a lithium replacement for a potential approach to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease. He recommended watching the next stages of this line of research as it “may be a potential insight into one of the therapeutic pathways,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been major advances in Alzheimer’s research, according to Whitmer. In the past, one of the only ways to identify the disease was finding tau tangles and amyloid plaques in the brain during an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and medical researchers have developed tests to detect biomarkers – biological molecules found in blood that can indicate the presence of conditions or diseases – &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/2021-2022-alzheimers-disease-related-dementias-scientific-advances/biomarker-research"&gt;for Alzheimer’s in living patients&lt;/a&gt;. Health care providers can also perform &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests#brain"&gt;brain imaging and lumbar punctures,&lt;/a&gt; to determine if a person has abnormal levels of amyloid and tau in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, plasma markers, which are blood-based biomarkers, have suggested to scientists that underlying pathologies in the brain can be seen in blood, according to Petersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner said the next steps will be determining whether there is an effective dose of lithium orotate or another lithium compound for humans that treats Alzheimer’s with minimal toxicity, as well as finding a diagnostic blood test that can reliably identify lithium deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how risk factors for diabetes or heart disease can show up in blood tests today, Yankner envisions a future where people can learn if they are at risk for Alzheimer’s from their annual physical with a primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one had a way of examining the lithium status of a person, that might dictate very early treatment,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;

There was a 16% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in adults 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The data will be presented this weekend to thousands of cardiologists at the annual meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;European Society of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; in Madrid, the world’s largest cardiology conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charles Williams, the study’s author and global associate medical director at GSK, said: “We looked at the currently available evidence, and found that in this analysis, vaccination against herpes zoster was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Further research studies are now needed to find out whether this association can be attributed to an effect of herpes zoster vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The global systematic review was conducted using three scientific literature databases, and a meta analysis was conducted of phase 3 randomised controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shingles jab is usually just taken once, and is typically administered in two doses, several months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Eight observational studies and one randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for studying the impact of the jab on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination is increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Filippo Crea, a cardiology professor at the Catholic University in Rome, who was not involved with the study, said: “These results support a growing body of evidence … which indicates that vaccinations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, also not involved with the research, welcomed the findings but said further research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said: “There is great interest in studies suggesting the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, although this analysis is largely based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that shingles can cause inflammation in the body, and that inflammation is a culprit in many heart and circulatory conditions which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By preventing shingles, vaccination could therefore be protective. But far more research is needed, especially to understand the intriguing results in younger people. More evidence will be needed before the shingles vaccine can be recommended for a wider age group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings came as NHS England said &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/08/shingles-vaccine-to-be-offered-to-hundreds-of-thousands-more-immunosuppressed-adults/#:~:text=Around%20300%2C000%20more%20people%20will,protect%20all%20severely%20immunosuppressed%20adults." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 more people would become eligible for the shingles jab from next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People eligible from 1 September are those between 18 and 49 with a severely weakened immune system.

    &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long relied on measurements like &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00879.x"&gt;body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratios&lt;/a&gt; to assess health risks. However, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on an unexpected indicator: neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thick neck might project strength, like that of heavyweight boxers or rugby players, but studies suggest it could signal a concerning health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMI, which divides weight by height to estimate body fat, doesn’t always tell the complete story. A competitive bodybuilder might have a high BMI, but clearly isn’t obese. This is where neck circumference offers additional insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people with larger necks relative to their body size face increased risks of several serious health conditions. The connection lies in what neck size reveals about fat distribution, particularly in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fat around your &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90357.2008"&gt;upper body&lt;/a&gt; releases fatty acids into your blood, which can interfere with how your body manages cholesterol, blood sugar and heart rhythm. Essentially, neck circumference serves as a proxy for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01160-w"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; – the harmful fat that wraps around your organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence linking neck size to health problems is striking. People with thicker necks show increased rates of several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870319300511"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/"&gt;Atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning. This condition causes irregular heartbeat and blood flow, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2397836"&gt;blood clots and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical imbalance in the heart can eventually progress to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neck circumference also correlates with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743524000148"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the main arteries to the heart narrow and restrict oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But cardiovascular problems aren’t the only concern. Larger neck circumference increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01111-z"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/correlation-between-neck-circumference-and-gestational-diabetes-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Diabetes can lead to serious long-term complications, including vision loss and limb amputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a connection to sleep disorders. Thick necks have been linked to &lt;a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/883776"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt;, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This condition causes extreme daytime fatigue and strains the cardiovascular system. People with sleep apnoea face higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/3971"&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt; due to their exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a risky neck size? For men, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;17 inches (43cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater increases health risks. For women, the threshold is &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;14 inches (35.5cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;17 inches or more is a risk factor for men.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;lolostock/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most surprisingly, these risks persist even in people with normal BMI. You could have a healthy weight according to traditional measures, but still face elevated health risks due to neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for each &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/16/6/664/7564829"&gt;additional centimetre&lt;/a&gt; of neck circumference beyond these thresholds, death rates and hospitalisation rates increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your neck measures above these thresholds, it’s not cause for panic – but it is worth taking seriously. Neck size represents just one piece of your overall health picture, but it’s an important one that’s often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle modifications. Cardiovascular exercise and weight training can help reduce upper-body fat. Quality sleep supports metabolic regulation and recovery. A balanced diet rich in pulses, fruits, and vegetables provides essential nutrients without excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring your neck takes seconds with a tape measure. Simply wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, ensuring the tape is snug but not tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple measurement could provide valuable insight into health risks that traditional metrics might miss. While neck circumference shouldn’t replace other health assessments, it offers another tool for understanding your cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era where we’re constantly seeking better ways to predict and prevent disease, sometimes the answers are literally right in front of us. Your neck might be revealing more about your health than you realise – and it’s worth paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

After 40 minutes, it hits 118F, and after an hour, it can rise to 123F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking water from plastic bottles left in vehicles could slowly poison the body, health experts are warning (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following their investigation, Nanjing University advised against storing plastic water bottles in warm temperatures, as the release of antimony and BPA increased with storage temperature, especially at 158°F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study in 2023 found similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, also looked at the impact of high temperatures on plastic water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that four common plastics, including polyethylene, released microparticles and nanoparticles when they were heated to 98.6F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Control samples that were kept in a dark, 40F refrigerator, however, released few to no particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent study found that no matter what the brand, bottles of plastic water contain hundreds of thousands of toxic microscopic plastic particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists using the most advanced laser scanning techniques found an average of 240,000 plastic particles in a one-liter bottle of water, compared to 5.5 per one liter of tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Columbia University researchers tested three popular brands of bottled water sold in the US - and, using lasers, analyzed the plastic particles they contained down to just 100 nanometers in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The particles - nanoplastics - are much smaller than the microplastics previously detected in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the particles are considered potentially toxic because they are so small that they can enter directly into blood cells and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These microscopic particles carry phthalates - chemicals that make plastics more durable, flexible, and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalate exposure is attributed to 100,000 premature deaths in the US each year. The chemicals are known to interfere with hormone production in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are 'linked with developmental, reproductive, brain, immune, and other problems', according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest estimates found 370,000 particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One recent study found, no matter what the brand, bottles of plastic water contain hundreds of thousands of toxic microscopic plastic particles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study out of Jiroft University of Medical Science in Iran found that microplastics were found in all colorectal cancer tissue samples studied. The accumulation of these substances was higher in cancerous tissues compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the findings, health experts across the board have called for policymakers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from London-based Deep Science Ventures warned after they conducted an eight-month investigation into the impact of chemical exposure on human health: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility, especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives. This is important because human and planetary health is at stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For us to ensure our continued development and ability to thrive as a human species, we have to accelerate the growth of innovative, technological solutions and ensure these are funded and scaled at pace.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the International Bottled Water Association, Americans drink some 15 billion gallons of bottled water each year - around 45 gallons per person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:48:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减食源性疾病监测计划- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/foodborne-disease/cdc-cuts-back-foodborne-illness-surveillance-program</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has scaled back a federal-state surveillance program for foodborne pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of July 1, the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/about/index.html"&gt;Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network&lt;/a&gt; (FoodNet), which works with the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of Agriculture, and 10 state health departments to track infections commonly transmitted through food, has reduced required surveillance to two pathogens: &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; and Shiga toxin–producing &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; (STEC). Reporting of illnesses caused by &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Shigella, Vibrio, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt; is now optional, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;amp;taid=68add0b9b2316600014ce6de&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, which cited a set of CDC talking points that suggested reduced federal funding for FoodNet was the reason for the move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and select counties in California and New York. A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health told CIDRAP News that all eight pathogens are covered by the state's infectious disease reporting rule, which means that all providers in the state are still required to report cases to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Health Department told NBC News that it will also continue tracking all eight pathogens regardless of the changes to FoodNet. But Colorado health officials said they may have to cut back on surveillance activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a query from CIDRAP News, an HHS spokesperson said in an email that FoodNet is focusing on &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC because they are among the top five contributors to foodborne illnesses and related hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. The official added that the CDC has different surveillance systems that track infections caused by the other pathogens, and that narrowing FoodNet's reporting requirements will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Active, population-based surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FoodNet has been around since 1995 and was created in the wake of the 1992-93 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; O157:H7 outbreak linked to Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers. &lt;/span&gt;According to Craig Hedberg, PhD, &lt;span&gt;a professor in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Minnesota and codirector of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence, it was built using the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites, which conducts population-based surveillance for a range of infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The idea was to perform active surveillance for seven foodborne pathogens that would be commonly diagnosed by clinical laboratories that served the populations in the FoodNet site catchment areas," Hedberg explained, with FoodNet auditing the labs to ensure that all diagnosed illnesses caused by the pathogens were reported. (An eighth pathogen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyclospora,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; was added in 1997).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food poisoning is a common cause of illness in the United States. According to the CDC, which bases its estimates on FoodNet surveillance, 48 million American get sick from a foodborne illness each year. Although most people recover from foodborne disease without requiring medical attention, 128,000 are hospitalized annually, and 3,000 die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and STEC are leading causes of foodborne illness in the United States, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are also common culprits. According to the CDC, 1.5 million Americans are sickened by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; each year, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant....In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2024 outbreak of listeriosis linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/listeria/listeria-outbreak-tied-deli-meats-grows-death-toll-reaches-9"&gt;Boar's Head deli meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; sickened at least 61 people in 19 states and was suspected in 10 deaths. A more recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; outbreak tied to packaged, pre-cooked meals has caused 17 illnesses and 3 deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It is especially heartbreaking to know that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is one of the pathogens that will not be tracked through FoodNet," said public health and veterinary consultant Gail Hansen, DVM, MPH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though states can continue to monitor for infections caused by all eight pathogens, Hansen said she's concerned that reduced FoodNet surveillance could hamper the ability to catch and notify the public about foodborne disease outbreaks before they spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The beauty of FoodNet was that it collected and coordinated information from all the states about germs that make us sick and quickly communicated it to everyone," she said. "Despite what the current HHS administration believes, ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. States do not have the ability to coordinate information and data across states, and this cut will bring us back to a time before FoodNet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foundation of the food safety system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hedberg noted that other CDC programs, like PulseNet, FoodCORE, and the Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence, are more actively focused on foodborne outbreak detection and investigation. But he warned that a loss of funding for these programs "would devastate our capacity to investigate outbreaks." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, Hedberg worries about the signal being sent by scaling back FoodNet surveillance efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant," he said. "In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It also supports our immune system, keeps our muscles functioning properly, and has some anti-inflammatory properties,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up. Yet as important as vitamin D is, it can be difficult to get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no superior way to get vitamin D. Getting vitamin D from a variety of sources is preferred,” says Diane Han, M.P.H., R.D.N., L.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist based in San Francisco and the founder of &lt;a href="https://wokingbalancewellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woking Balance Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woking Balance Wellness&lt;/a&gt;.

The first is that the body can make vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin. The second is to get it from foods in which it naturally occurs, and the third is to consume it via foods that have been fortified with vitamin D. The fourth, then, is to take a vitamin D supplement, which contains two subtypes: D2 and D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamins D2 and D3 are used similarly in the body,” says Han. Both need to be converted in the body to calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D, or the form that your cells can actually use. Calcitriol is available as a prescription medication, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682335.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine;&lt;/a&gt; it's used to treat low calcium and bone disease in patients with kidney or parathyroid dysfunction. But if you are looking to supplement with vitamin D, you'll be choosing between one of these two inactive forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few key differences between D2 and D3, namely where they come from and how effective they are at improving vitamin D levels in the body (D3 seems to be slightly better in this department—more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D2 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D2, also called ergocalciferol, comes mainly from plant sources and fungi such as mushrooms. Interestingly, when mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or UV light, they produce D2,” says Bakovic. She adds that D2 is also added to some foods, the most common of which are dairy, soy, almond, and rice milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese, and orange juice, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D2 is what is considered an inactive form of vitamin D, which means the body must transform it before being able to utilize it. “Once in your body, D2 is converted in the liver to a form called calcidiol, and then subsequently in the kidneys to calcitriol, which is the active form of D,” Bakovic explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D2 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After vitamin D2 is converted to the active form of vitamin D, the body can then use it for the processes mentioned above, such as reinforcing bones and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65797024/boost-immune-system-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strengthening the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strengthening the immune system&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D2 may also be used in treatment plans for hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands), vitamin D-resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus in the blood), in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65403333/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D3 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65802092/what-vitamin-d3-does-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin D3;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, or cholecalciferol, is another inactive form of vitamin D. Its sources include skin exposure to sunlight and animal-based foods such as salmon, sardines, egg yolks, and liver,” says Han. Similar to D2, D3 needs to go through a conversion process before the body is able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D3 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There aren’t any specific processes that require D3 exclusively,” says Bakovic. “However, because it’s more bioavailable [meaning it enters the circulation and is able to impact the body], it is usually more effective in the prevention and/or correction of a Vitamin D deficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the key way in which vitamin D3 differs from D2. A 2024 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)01394-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Advances in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;analyzed 20 studies that compared the efficacy of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3 for raising the levels of vitamin D in the body and found that vitamin D3 was better at raising total vitamin D concentration in the blood. However, the researchers also found that when they looked at the concentration of hydroxylated (or active) vitamin D, the difference between D2 and D3 was negligible, especially in people who were taking it daily. So while D3 supplements do appear to be more bioavailable, both forms of vitamin D can be effective for combating vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin D3 has been shown to be more effective at raising vitamin D levels when they are low, both D3 and D2 are easily converted in the body into the active, usable form we need to support key processes and optimize health. Still, the best thing to do before deciding which one to take is to talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if you can safely take vitamin D (it may interact with some medications and shouldn’t be taken if you have certain other medical problems, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;) and how much to take to get the benefits you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

							&lt;p data-start="706" data-end="727"&gt;We’ve all met them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The 72-year-old who seems to carry light around with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The woman at the farmer’s market with laugh lines and glowing skin who looks like she’s aging in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The grandfather who’s more energetic than his thirtysomething kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="965" data-end="1044"&gt;Yes, genetics matter. But psychology suggests there’s more going on than DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1046" data-end="1255"&gt;People who remain radiant and youthful into their 70s tend to share a set of daily practices that shape not only how they look, but how they carry themselves, how they connect, and how they radiate vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1257" data-end="1293"&gt;Here are eight of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1300" data-end="1352"&gt;1. They reframe stress instead of stewing in it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Stress ages us faster than sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Cortisol, the stress hormone, has been linked to wrinkles, inflammation, and even memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;The youthful 70-somethings you meet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;They’re not stress-free—they’re stress-resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Psychologically, they practice &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-reappraisal"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1617" data-end="1640"&gt;cognitive reappraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: reframing challenges as temporary, manageable, or even meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Instead of spiraling over a rude comment, they’ll shrug and think, &lt;em data-start="1776" data-end="1798"&gt;That’s not about me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1802" data-end="1948"&gt;It doesn’t erase problems, but it changes their body’s reaction. Less cortisol means less wear-and-tear. And less wear-and-tear means more glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1950" data-end="2055"&gt;So while others stew in negativity, they’ve mastered the art of letting go—and it shows on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2062" data-end="2098"&gt;2. They stay socially connected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2100" data-end="2222"&gt;Loneliness doesn’t just hurt feelings—it hurts health. Studies show chronic loneliness can age cells as much as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;The radiant elders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;They cultivate community. Weekly walks with neighbors. Standing phone calls with old friends. Joining choirs, gardening clubs, or book groups—not to kill time, but to nurture connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;em data-start="2456" data-end="2476"&gt;social integration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;It feeds emotional needs, buffers stress, and keeps the brain sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Even small interactions—a chat with the cashier, a wave to the mail carrier—stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Over decades, they create a net of belonging that protects against isolation’s aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2733" data-end="2830"&gt;Youthfulness is contagious, and these people make sure they’re always plugged into the current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2837" data-end="2884"&gt;3. They move their bodies daily—but gently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;We often assume youthful people are the ones grinding it out in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;But many radiant elders aren’t lifting heavy—they’re simply moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3030" data-end="3143"&gt;Morning stretches. Daily walks. Gardening, dancing, swimming, yoga. Activities that feel joyful, not punishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;Psychology explains this through &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/attitude-behavior-consistency"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3178" data-end="3202"&gt;behavioral consistency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: when exercise is enjoyable, people stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;When it’s punishing, they quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3287" data-end="3385"&gt;The result is decades of circulation, mobility, and energy—not burned-out joints and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3387" data-end="3518"&gt;They don’t obsess over “fitness.” They weave movement into daily life like it’s brushing their teeth. And the glow is cumulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3525" data-end="3557"&gt;4. They cultivate curiosity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3559" data-end="3681"&gt;There’s something unmistakable about a 70-year-old who still leans forward in conversation, eyes bright, eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Youthfulness isn’t just physical—it’s mental flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-openness-influences-your-behavior-4796351"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3765" data-end="3789"&gt;openness to experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the willingness to try new things, learn, and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;People who age radiantly often read widely, ask questions, explore new hobbies, and stay culturally curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;They don’t get stuck in &lt;em data-start="3981" data-end="4012"&gt;this is how it’s always been.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4016" data-end="4134"&gt;Curiosity keeps neural pathways active. It creates novelty, which sparks dopamine, which keeps mood and energy high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4136" data-end="4261"&gt;In short: they stay young because they stay interested. And people who are interested in life remain interesting to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4268" data-end="4312"&gt;5. They practice gratitude like hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4314" data-end="4418"&gt;Bitterness is heavy. It furrows brows, stiffens posture, and makes people look older than their years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;Radiant 70-somethings tend to practice gratitude daily—not as a grand gesture, but as a micro-habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;A pause over coffee. A whispered thank-you after a phone call. A nightly reflection on what went right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Psychology shows &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/"&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt; shifts attention toward abundance rather than lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Over time, this fosters optimism, which is strongly linked to resilience and even longer lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4809" data-end="4941"&gt;You can see it on their faces: softened lines, relaxed eyes, a kind of ease that comes from choosing appreciation over resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4943" data-end="5011"&gt;Gratitude isn’t just good manners. It’s anti-aging for the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5018" data-end="5064"&gt;6. They prioritize sleep like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5066" data-end="5189"&gt;We glorify busyness in younger decades, but by 70, the wise ones know: nothing steals glow faster than sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Psychologists emphasize the link between &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-19400-1"&gt;sleep and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Without rest, people grow irritable, anxious, and more prone to stress—all of which accelerate aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;Radiant elders treat sleep as non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;They keep routines, respect bedtime, and protect their rest the way others protect their bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5522" data-end="5618"&gt;This consistency shows up in clearer skin, steadier moods, sharper minds, and better immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5620" data-end="5726"&gt;They don’t brag about “getting by” on five hours. They brag about eight—and the glow that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5733" data-end="5757"&gt;7. They laugh—a lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It sounds simple, but laughter is medicine with measurable effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It reduces stress hormones, boosts immune function, and strengthens social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;Youthful elders aren’t humorless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;They find reasons to laugh daily—through comedy, friends, silly stories, or simply not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6179"&gt;Psychologists frame this as &lt;em data-start="6097" data-end="6125"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2847490/"&gt;positive affect regulatio&lt;/a&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;: deliberately seeking joy to counterbalance stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6297"&gt;Wrinkles from frowning deepen tension. Wrinkles from laughter deepen warmth. And everyone prefers the second kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6414"&gt;If you want to look youthful at 70, stop worrying about the laugh lines—and start worrying if you don’t have any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6421" data-end="6449"&gt;8. They nurture purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6451" data-end="6532"&gt;Perhaps the most underrated habit: they have a reason to get up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;a href="https://kyoseiconsulting.com/ikigai-and-aging-well/"&gt;&lt;em data-start="6556" data-end="6564"&gt;ikigai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese culture—a sense of life purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Whether it’s volunteering, mentoring, gardening, or simply being the glue of their family, radiant elders keep contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6738" data-end="6849"&gt;Purpose provides motivation, structure, and meaning. It keeps them mentally engaged and emotionally grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6851" data-end="6964"&gt;Without purpose, days feel flat and repetitive. With purpose, days feel alive—and that energy radiates outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6966" data-end="7036"&gt;They don’t just live long. They live well. And that makes them glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7043" data-end="7066"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;Looking youthful into your 70s isn’t about chasing trends or obsessing over wrinkle creams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;It’s about psychology—the small, consistent ways we frame our lives, regulate our emotions, and nurture our connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;The elders who glow are rarely the ones who “had it easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;Many faced hardships, losses, health scares. But instead of letting those experiences calcify into bitterness, they turned them into wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7487" data-end="7581"&gt;And that’s the secret: youthfulness isn’t the absence of age. It’s the presence of vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7588" data-end="7608"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7610" data-end="7695"&gt;Radiance at 70 doesn’t come from erasing the years. It comes from living them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7880"&gt;The habits are deceptively simple—gratitude, laughter, movement, connection—but over decades, they carve out something more powerful than perfect skin: a spirit that refuses to dim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8026"&gt;And when you meet someone who carries that kind of light, you don’t think about their age. You just think, &lt;em data-start="7989" data-end="8024"&gt;I want to glow like that someday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Inside every human brain lies a detailed map of the body, with different regions dedicated to different body parts – the hands, lips, feet and more. But what happens to this map when a body part is removed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1929/6206526"&gt;scientists believed&lt;/a&gt; that when a body part is amputated, the brain's body map dramatically reorganises itself, with neighbouring body parts taking over the area once represented by the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of large-scale brain reorganisation became a central pillar of what neuroscientists call adult brain plasticity: the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injuries, new experiences or training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-medieval-italian-man-replaced-his-amputated-hand-with-a-knife"&gt;This Medieval Italian Man Replaced His Amputated Hand With a Knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows the opposite is true: the brain's body map remains strikingly stable, even years after amputation.&lt;br&gt;
To test what happens in the brain after a person loses a body part, we took a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with NHS surgeons, we followed three adult patients who were preparing to undergo lifesaving arm amputations for medical reasons, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or severe problems with blood supply. We scanned their brains with functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) before the amputation and repeatedly afterwards – in some cases for as long as five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the MRI scans, we asked patients to move different body parts: tapping their individual fingers, curling their toes or pursing their lips. This allowed us to map brain activity and to construct the brain's body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, we repeated the scans, this time asking them to move their missing (phantom) fingers. Phantom movements are not imaginary: most amputees continue to feel vivid sensations of their missing limbs, even though they are physically no longer there. Doing so gave us a rare opportunity to directly compare the brain's hand map before and after amputation in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that, across all three patients, the map of the hand in the brain remained remarkably unchanged and did not get overwritten by other body parts, such as the face. This neural stability helps explain why so many amputees continue to feel their missing limbs so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most amputees, however, phantom sensations are not neutral sensations; they are painful and described as burning, stabbing or itching. For years, the dominant explanation for these painful sensations came from the idea that the brain's body map has reorganised itself. In turn, this theory inspired therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPxKr1dMU0"&gt;mirror box therapy&lt;/a&gt;, virtual reality training, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplcT2MjuEc"&gt;sensory-discrimination exercises&lt;/a&gt;, all aimed at fixing supposedly broken maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mirror-box therapy explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show the brain's body map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; broken. This helps explain why these therapies consistently fail to outperform  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatments in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. If the map remains intact, trying to fix it is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, our results suggest we should look elsewhere, for example, in the nerves that are cut during surgery. Severed nerves can form tangled clusters that misfire signals back to the brain. New amputation surgical techniques are being developed to preserve nerve signalling and maintain stable connections to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings have important implications for developing prosthetic limbs and brain-computer interfaces. Invasive next-generation brain-computer interfaces can tap directly into the preserved map of the amputated body part to decode what movements are being attempted or even deliver electrical stimulation to the map to enable amputees to feel their missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technologies are in development and could, one day, restore natural and intuitive control and sensations of a prosthetic limb, by using the preserved body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that our brains have a resilient model of the body that maintains the representations, even when the sensory input is lost.

                        &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic was supposed to serve as a wake-up call, making the value of scientific expertise, medical research, and public-health preparedness impossible to ignore, let alone deny. But the opposite has happened in the US, and Donald Trump and his supporters bear much of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div dir="ltr" class="article__body article__body--commentary  english" itemprop="articleBody" data-page-area="article-body"&gt;
                            &lt;p data-line-id="e0f9bfb8882542108aee4909d4c9717e"&gt; CAMBRIDGE – US President William McKinley died in 1901 from gunshot wounds that modern medicine could easily have treated. Though X-rays had been invented, they were not yet widely available, so McKinley’s medical team were unable to find one of the assassin’s bullets. And the antibiotics that could have prevented the onset of sepsis – McKinley’s ultimate cause of death – would not be discovered for another few decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="a6e2ed9e9adf457fba3e14e818b3bc41"&gt; When US President Donald Trump talks about making America great again, this is the period to which he is referring. McKinley was a “strong believer in tariffs,” Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5272753/why-trump-loves-former-president-mckinley-so-much"&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt;, and under his leadership, the United States was “probably the wealthiest” it has been at any point in its history. As usual, however, Trump gets both the history and the economics wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="259fee5cd7b6419cb690e1cf30b10f0d"&gt; For starters, the McKinley Tariff was &lt;a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/tariff-1890-mckinley-tariff-5869/fulltext"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, when its namesake was a representative. During his presidency, which began seven years later, McKinley turned against tariffs. Moreover, although it was the height of the Gilded Age, all was not golden for Americans. &lt;a href="https://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.com/2012/09/us-real-per-capita-gdp-from-18702001.html"&gt;Real incomes&lt;/a&gt; were one-seventh of their size today, and extreme inequality &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carnegie-gilded/"&gt;prevailed&lt;/a&gt;. Something like 1% of American households had indoor toilets in 1890, compared to 99% today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="7bbee0932103495fb1ba845d1c7005a8"&gt; Needless to say, health outcomes have improved dramatically since McKinley’s day. US &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041693/united-states-all-time-child-mortality-rate/"&gt;child mortality&lt;/a&gt; has plummeted from 23.9% in 1890 to 0.7% today, and average &lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/nchs/2020/11/20/7035/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; at birth has soared from 47 to 77 years. We owe this progress largely to improvements in sanitation and advances in science and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-line-id="27fcf0254e8b45878a9f5dbe13cbb49b"&gt; Consider the impact of vaccination. Since Max Theiler, a South African immigrant, developed a yellow-fever vaccine in 1937, the disease has been eradicated in the US and many other countries. After Pearl Kendrick and Grace Eldering developed their pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine in 1939, deaths from that disease declined sharply. Since Jonas Salk developed his &lt;a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/6QWhgYkCnslptw"&gt;polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, followed by the Polish immigrant Albert Sabin’s oral vaccine in 1960, the disease has been eradicated in all but a handful of countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="ab4c463e720d4ec8b064460fc8b6fef3"&gt; Measles is another example here. It was once a leading cause of child mortality in the US. In 2000, it was declared eliminated in the US and sharply suppressed in the rest of the world, thanks to a vaccine introduced in 1963. Vaccines against smallpox, typhoid fever, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, and the flu have saved countless lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="listing special asize inlay special--generic" data-message-area="promotion-Commentary" data-page-subarea="promotion-subscription" dir="ltr" lang="en-us"&gt;

&lt;p data-line-id="123af0ab6aaf47dc9e27326e6a0dbb94"&gt; And then there is the COVID-19 vaccine – a true triumph of modern science. Building on &lt;a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/why-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research-catastrophic-mistake"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; breakthroughs, the vaccines were developed in under a year, and &lt;a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/virus-vaccination-and-voting"&gt;they averted&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 14-20 million deaths in their first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/"&gt;12 months&lt;/a&gt;. This achievement was made possible, in part, by the work of immigrants: Hungarian-born Katalin Karikó, Lebanese-born Noubar Afeyan, and French-born Stéphane Bancel at Moderna, and Indian-born Nita Patel, who led Novavax’s vaccine team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="213d6a980e894ab3a30892dfa8d26123"&gt; Taken together, vaccines have saved at least &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years"&gt;154 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over the last half-century, and they continue to save an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/immunization"&gt;4-5 million lives&lt;/a&gt; per year. And this is to say nothing of the myriad other life-saving advances in diagnostics and treatment that have emerged in the 124 years since McKinley was shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="1d1137430cc8473ca5fe33c1cd81510b"&gt; Trump is now threatening to unravel this progress. His administration has &lt;a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10497981"&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/3032216/foreign-aid-the-powerful-us-soft-power-is-gone"&gt;foreign aid&lt;/a&gt; and balked at international cooperation in the name of “America First.” And now he has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the director of the Centers for Disease Control because she refused to endorse Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s anti-vaccine policies. But by enabling the resurgence of diseases that have been brought under control, and hampering progress in tackling others, Trump is indirectly jeopardizing Americans’ health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="d491414e0ccd40e5893d84d999a1a086"&gt; Trump is also mounting direct attacks on their health at home. His administration has all but declared war on universities, hospitals, public-health agencies, and other non-profit science-based institutions. Funding for vital medical research – including grants from the National Institutes of Health – has been sharply reduced or eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="c69975f17ff248678317a5f3b3f881bc"&gt; Trump’s war on universities dovetails with his war on immigrants. As students return to university campuses to begin the new academic year, many desks are empty, because the Trump administration has blocked their would-be occupants from entering the US. Trump is also seeking to make it harder for foreigners to remain in the US after receiving their degrees, despite the long list of scientific breakthroughs to which immigrants have contributed. This is not a brain drain, but a brain squeeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="212b193c170940ecbf267c9265dd4e8d"&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic was supposed to serve as a wake-up call, making the value of scientific expertise, medical research, and public-health preparedness impossible to ignore, let alone deny. But the opposite has happened in the US: trust in science, government, and public institutions has plumbed new lows, owing partly to the MAGA movement’s promotion of health misinformation, conspiracy theories, and mistrust of “the establishment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="e775a809123f4f9a8304c137dee9e7f0"&gt; Now, vaccine skepticism is surging, with a growing number of Americans doubting the safety and efficacy not only of the COVID-19 vaccine, but also of the established vaccines that have saved millions of children’s lives and added decades to our lifespans over the last century. Vaccine misinformation of the kind peddled by Kennedy has already contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-019-0354-3"&gt;measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-line-id="cc782742762e4e3b85be6398f3e172f2"&gt; One might say that the Trump administration is attempting to turn back the clock on public health to 1900. The question is why. Applying Occam’s razor – the principle that the simplest explanation is the most likely – one can only conclude that the objective and the effect are the same: to increase the number of people suffering and dying from contagious disease. Now &lt;em&gt;there’s&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy theory for the Trump faithful to sink their paranoia into! &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

            Now, researchers are trying to learn how many people have “young COPD,” meaning the condition is diagnosed before 50 years of age. “Young COPD” was present in 4.5% of adults under 50 in the population studied, a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fevidence.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FEVIDoa2400424&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027673942654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=hl3YvrA1ft0R29S5HHFnpjPy8EhltzbCD0GIl16oaVg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;NEJM Evidence&lt;/a&gt;​ found. The diagnosis was associated with a significantly elevated risk of hospitalization due to lower respiratory disease and an increased risk of death before 75.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What is COPD, and what are the risk factors for developing this condition? And why might young COPD increase mortality risk? What should people with COPD do to improve their health outcomes?

The two most common types of COPD are emphysema, which occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and lose their ability to stretch and exchange oxygen, and chronic bronchitis, which is marked by long-term inflammation and narrowing of the airways, often with excess mucus and a persistent cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who currently smoke or previously smoked have a higher chance of developing COPD. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, polluted air or other environmental workplace hazards. In addition, individuals with a history of asthma and a family history of COPD are at higher risk for having COPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the study authors, previous researchers have used varying definitions of “young COPD.” For instance, some have included only those who have had a smoking history. This study used a more expansive definition to account for nonsmokers with COPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000g3b6ni3l9a371@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, individuals must meet three sets of criteria. The first is having a spirometry measurement showing airflow obstruction. Spirometry is a breathing test that measures how much air a person can exhale and how quickly, which helps determine whether the lungs are blocked or narrowed. The second is having either 10 or more &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdictionaries%2Fcancer-terms%2Fdef%2Fpack-year&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674009427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XQUtwlel9G7Jm2Nj7pcKJzwY8d6t%2FWRGWAF4kJuH8kI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pack years&lt;/a&gt; of smoking, or symptoms of cough, phlegm and trouble breathing. The third is age between 18 and 49 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What did the study show about the prognosis of people with the condition? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers examined four groups of people who were already participating in other research studies. This is important because they were not selected based on smoking exposure or existence of respiratory illnesses; therefore, their health characteristics broadly reflected the overall US population. Using this definition, they determined that the prevalence of young COPD was 4.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000j3b6n8fwnljcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers then tracked outcomes of participants with young COPD compared with those without this condition. They found that premature mortality, defined as death before 75 years of age, was increased more than 1.4 times among those with young COPD. The likelihood of hospitalization or death due to chronic lung disease was more than 2.5 times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The first step is to be aware that they carry the diagnosis. Many people who have COPD &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Fsymptoms-diagnosis%2Fearly-warning-signs%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520over%252016%2520million%2Cis%2520often%2520manageable%2520and%2520treatable.&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674094671%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=yYI6Yfh6uHyVm%2FeHu0E%2FXpNYqvTDw3s9dGTD%2F0%2BGqrE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;may not know it&lt;/a&gt;. They may attribute a chronic cough to a persistent virus or shortness of breath to aging. Or they may think that because they never smoked, they can’t have COPD. This is not correct. While smoking is a major risk factor for developing COPD, according to the American Lung Association, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Fsymptoms-diagnosis%2Fearly-warning-signs%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520over%252016%2520million%2Cis%2520often%2520manageable%2520and%2520treatable.&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674111124%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1ZL695cfj%2BmAk5QC2p3ME1Bs88DW2ChsMLmQZ212lTk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 4 people&lt;/a&gt; with COPD never smoked.

            There are several symptoms that can serve as &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Fsymptoms-diagnosis%2Fearly-warning-signs%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520over%252016%2520million%2Cis%2520often%2520manageable%2520and%2520treatable.&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674127916%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=T0wSy4Al2DMtKrPstgjkYDdrQdNyERjVRG1ybOec3zU%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;. These include having recurrent lung infections like &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hopkinsmedicine.org%2Fhealth%2Fconditions-and-diseases%2Facute-bronchitis&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674144312%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZejT4llA7UYnTdMnDYnHXzsR9J8b61qp406uIHpaFeY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;acute bronchitis&lt;/a&gt; or pneumonia, new or worse shortness of breath, a cough that brings up mucus and phlegm, wheezing, chest tightness and fatigue. People who have these symptoms should bring them up with their primary care provider, who can perform an assessment that could include spirometry testing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000q3b6nuoi5nzz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once someone is diagnosed with COPD, their physician or other primary care provider will recommend a combination of therapies. These include lifestyle changes, most notably quitting smoking. Other important steps may include staying physically active, reducing exposure to air pollution and secondhand smoke, and participating in &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-procedures-and-tests%2Fpulmonary-rehab&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674160463%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=sDyGLhKRFiJLPllVdQokdh02oRFq3ecB74ShM%2Fd4sy0%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pulmonary rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a structured program of exercise, education and support designed to improve ease of breathing and overall quality of life.

            Making sure to stay up-to-date with vaccinations is essential, as people with COPD are at greater risk of serious illness if they were to contract respiratory illnesses. They should speak with their providers about whether they are &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;up-to-date with vaccines&lt;/a&gt; including streptococcal pneumonia, pertussis, Covid-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.

            The provider may also recommend &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Ftreating%2Fcopd-medications&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674227554%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=HZrKR9MkFJzEj56lVPCeE7qI1DOYFrOXyZ2N%2BQEhGj4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;one or multiple medications&lt;/a&gt; that treat COPD symptoms. These include bronchodilators that relax the airway muscles and anti-inflammatories that reduce inflammation and mucus production. Individuals with COPD should also be alert to early signs of infection. They may receive specific antiviral treatment, and antibiotics are often given if a bacterial infection is suspected since infections can quickly worsen breathing problems.

I developed this horrific electrical pulsating sensation throughout my body, 24/7.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her symptoms worsened and she was soon unable to walk, and for the next four months could not tolerate light, sound or touch. Even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Their voices cut through my brain like a knife,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brianne Dressen, then 39, received a single vaccine dose in AstraZeneca 's Utah trials in November 2020 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told Daily Mail soon that after receiving the vaccine she had trouble walking and began experiencing pain in her arms and legs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In constant agony, she said she contemplated suicide, but with the support of family, the vaccine injured community, and her husband, Dr Brian Dressen, she pulled through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and alleged in her lawsuit that AstraZeneca refused to comply with its contractual obligations to care for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she experiences fatigue, an internal buzzing sensation, weakness in her arms and legs, which means she sometimes needs a wheelchair, tinnitus, nausea, a weak bladder, food allergies and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), an irregular heartbeat and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dressen has a PhD in chemistry and wrote to neurologists trying to find answers for his wife's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he was surprised when neuroimmunology specialist Dr Avindra Nath, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH, replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nath wanted to explore whether Dr Dressen's wife was suffering from a vaccine injury. When he set up a trial to test for Covid vaccine injury, she was the first enrolled in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, the NIH diagnosed Dressen with post-vaccine neuropathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 12 months following her trial vaccination, Dressen says she endured 60 doctors appointments, four emergency department visits, and one hospital admission. She said medical bills began to mount, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told this website she was in so much pain that she contemplated suicide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said her symptoms were so severe even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to AstraZeneca for financial assistance based on the contract she signed, which stated that the trial's 'sponsor will pay the costs of medical treatment for research injuries, provided that the costs are reasonable, and you did not cause the injury yourself.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dressen said AstraZeneca offered only a tiny fraction of the cost to cover expenses. She said they offered to increase the amount if she agreed to absolve them of any future liability. She refused the offers as she said they were derisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has a growing medical bill and is suing AstraZeneca for alleged breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment but filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, so they launched an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the Public Readiness and Preparedness (PREP) Act 2005, was set up to provide immunity to companies making vaccines when a public health emergency has been declared, as was the case during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It prevents the injured from suing unless a lawyer can prove there is evidence of willful misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For serious injury or death caused by emergency use vaccines, people must apply within 12 months for compensation to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) set up in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CICP is a no-fault government program run by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that covers emergency use products, like the Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, then 24, said he developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020 in an AstraZeneca trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It pays for hospital costs not covered by insurance, lost wages up to $50,000, and just over $400,000 for a death, but most claims have been denied. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr criticized the scheme and said: 'It is broken, and I intend to fix it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 1, 2025, the CICP had received 13,836 claims from trial volunteers and citizens for Covid vaccine injuries, with 9,423 still pending review. It has paid just 39, denying 4,338 – with 2,318 rejected because claimants missed the 12-month deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experts agree patients' symptoms should never be dismissed, they stress that they believe Covid vaccine injuries are overall rare and estimate the shots have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccine side effects impact around one in 200,000 people, according to official US data. Approximately 270million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally, including 3million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, however, Yale researchers discovered a syndrome linked to the Covid vaccines. The previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' - appears to cause brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' but based on the results of the small study, more research on post-vaccination syndrome is needed, independent experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another AstraZeneca trial, two British volunteers collapsed, having developed transverse myelitis, a serious nervous system disorder that can cause paralysis. The trials were temporarily halted in September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were restarted six days later in the UK, by mid-September in Brazil, and by October in the US after an investigation determined the vaccine was not to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca also ran a trial at the Federal University of São Paolo, Brazil, with 5,000 volunteers. Student pharmacologist and gym enthusiast, Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, 24, took part and developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A type 1 diabetic, he was deemed fit to take part in the trial, but Souza said he developed Covid-like symptoms after his first dose on October 16, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza is a type 1 diabetic, but he was deemed fit to take part in the trial for AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza said: 'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid tests came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his second injection, he developed encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, and suffered a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza told DailyMail.com: 'My family took me to hospital. I was released after an overnight stay. I went home, had breakfast and went to bed. I collapsed in my bedroom, and my family took me back to hospital. I woke up three weeks later, having been sedated all that time, and spent two months in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While I was in the coma, neurologists investigated whether other viruses or bacteria caused my seizures but found no infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since there was no other identified cause before the vaccination, they requested the unblinding of the vaccine trial and discovered I had not received the placebo, which was the meningitis vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza will need medication for life to control his epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca refused to recognize his injury and provided no medical assistance according to Souza, so in 2021, Souza filed a civil suit in Bahia state court seeking financial compensation for alleged pain, suffering, emotional distress, financial losses and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza is bitter, he said. He told DailyMail.com: 'I was treated like a disposable number.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he met with AstraZeneca's lawyers twice, but they failed to offer a reasonable settlement. AstraZeneca has denied any wrongdoing. The case is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another part of the world for another Covid vaccine, criminal lawyer Augusto Roux, 40, took part in Pfizer's trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and said he suffered a serious adverse reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer conducted its largest Covid vaccine study there, with 5,700 volunteers representing 10 percent of Pfizer's worldwide trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Augusto Roux, then 36, took part in Pfizer's Covid vaccine trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He told the Daily Mail he developed a high fever that persisted for weeks after receiving his second dose of Pfizer's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was run by the Argentine military at Hospital Militar Central – Central Military Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, who was 36 at the time, received his first Pfizer dose in August 2020 with no complications. However, after his second dose the following month, he said he was near death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, sharing the experience he lays out in his complaint, told the Daily Mail: 'I developed a 104-degree Fahrenheit [40C] fever which lasted several weeks; loss of consciousness, and tachycardia that could have killed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage, but trial doctors ignored these symptoms and questioned my mental health. Pfizer did not want to investigate my reaction and suggested I was infected with coronavirus, but all coronavirus tests were negative.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina, Dr Fernando Pedro Polack, who diagnosed Roux's illness as mental health issues. However, Dr Polack is not a mental health provider and is a pediatric infectious disease specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pedro Polack did not respond to Daily Mail's request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux thinks treating his injuries have cost around $150,000 so far, paid for by health insurance, despite a contract with Pfizer that said he would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor David Healy, a pharmacologist trained to assess adverse drug reactions, was one of four doctors who assessed Roux's physical and mental health, at Roux's request. He acted pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'Roux had a significant injury linked to the vaccine and the failure to recognize this in his trial record amounts to a breach of good clinical trial practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It does not appear that Roux's injuries have been registered. If the trial is misleading in Roux's case, in how many other cases of people vaccinated in Buenos Aires has this also been the case?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he now has pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux said: 'I realized that they had deleted records of my adverse events a year later when I accessed my medical records and they weren't there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A criminal case has now been launched by Roux alleging Pfizer, and the officials in charge of the trial, are guilty of abuse of power, failing to protect him, failing in public duty, bribery and corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He alleges the regulatory and judicial authorities suppressed adverse event reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, Argentina's Federal Chamber, similar to the Federal Court of Appeals, requested a formal investigation into trial irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux's investigations led to the Independent Ethics Committee of the Military Hospital (CIREC) being suspended for 90 days on May 20, 2021, by Dr Laura Antonietti, Director of Medical Education and Research, a senior Argentine Ministry of Health Official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also offered to investigate but did not follow through, although they did conduct preliminary enquiries and said they were happy the trial was following good clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Patient safety is paramount and we take any reports of adverse events very seriously. Adverse event reports do not imply causality, and in the context of vaccination such events may be unrelated to administration of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hundreds of millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine remains positive for all authorized indications and age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As with every medicine and vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has robust processes to meet its regulatory responsibilities to closely monitor, report and analyze all adverse events, and collect relevant information to assess any new potential safety risks that may be associated with the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition to our pharmacovigilance efforts and compliance with regulatory requirements related to quality and safety, we also work with regulatory authorities around the world as they independently monitor the safety profile of our vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients who receive the COVID-19 vaccine should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse if they have any concerns or experience any side effects. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the package leaflet. Side effects can be reported directly via the Yellow Card Scheme or via VAERS.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’re firmly still in the summer months but many of us have been struck with symptoms we’d usually associate with the winter – runny noses, dry coughs and fevers. Right now, chances are these symptoms are caused by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of the pandemic-causing virus are among the highest they have been all year. Here, the scientists explain exactly why Covid is on the rise again and, vitally, how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do so many people have Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infection rates always go up because of one of three reasons,” says Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s either because immunity to Covid among the population has fallen; a new and more infectious variant is spreading; or behaviour has changed in a way that increases the risk of exposure to the virus, he explains. All three factors are currently at play, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Immunity against Covid is low&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid cases are no longer being tracked as thoroughly as they were during the pandemic, when tests were dished out for free. However, monitoring shows that cases are currently at their highest level this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures, compiled by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), show that around nine per cent of all Covid tests taken in the week to August 24 were positive, which is the highest level seen since last November. The figures show that 10.8 per cent of people tested in GP practices were infected, while 8.8 per cent of swabs among hospital patients were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reporting rates have been around base levels for almost a year now and so population immunity will be relatively low,” Prof Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming infected with Covid, the immune system develops antibodies against it. These are fighter cells that recognise and neutralise the virus when the body comes into contact with it again. “Immunity to infection probably lasts only a few months on average,” Prof Hunter notes, after which point the body is once again vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that is probably the major factor,” fuelling the current upward trend in infections, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The new XFG variant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;XFG, a sub-variant of the once infamous Omicron, was first &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; in January. This strain of the virus, which has been nicknamed Stratus, is currently responsible for that majority of Covid cases in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is also responsible for around 60 per cent of Covid cases globally, according to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/summary"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is actively monitoring XFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has become dominant because it is more infectious (able to bypass existing immunity to some degree) than prior variants,” explains Prof Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But its relative growth advantage is only about 31 per cent, which is not great compared to many previous variants,” he notes. For comparison, the Omicron variant, which caused chaos when it swept the world in late 2021, had a growth advantage of around 200 per cent when it emerged. “So it will be contributing to the growth in cases but I suspect not the main driver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Covid infections are now asymptomatic in many people, there have been reports that an XFG infection may be more likely to cause a hoarse, scratchy or raspy voice. Other common symptoms are still a cough, fever and change of taste or smell, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen the comments on hoarseness but given we see and diagnose such a small proportion of infections now and then usually only the more severe cases, I am not convinced,” Prof Hunter says. “Also adenoviruses [a cause of the common cold] are almost as common in lab tests and they do cause hoarseness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Summer socialising, travel and schools reopening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer events, such as festivals and large gatherings like weddings, are “inevitably contributing” to the rise in cases, according to Prof Peter Openshaw, a respiratory physician and mucosal immunologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased foreign travel during the school holidays will also be contributing to the increase,” Prof Hunter adds. His &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299714"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked travelling abroad with an increased risk of catching Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, looking back over the pattern of transmissions, it does seem that maybe going back to school could be associated with a rise,” Prof Openshaw notes. Schools opening in early September could further encourage the spread of the virus, meaning that, by October, cases are even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that during October we’re going to be seeing a lot more Covid around,” he says. “There was quite a peak in October 2024 and then it settled around Christmas time and was replaced by influenza. It could be that we’re going to see more cases but I think we’ll have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big question is how high will reporting levels go and when they will peak,” Prof Hunter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to avoid it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of isolating yourself at home, there’s unfortunately no magic bullet that will guarantee that you won’t catch Covid or other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regular hand washing and sanitising communal surfaces, such as trays on aeroplanes and trays, as well as gym equipment can reduce your risk of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us, the need to avoid infection is not as great as we will have had multiple infections by now and most infections are asymptomatic,” Prof Hunter says. “On average in England, we will have had about four infections each by now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older and medically vulnerable people should remain more cautious, he says. “Wear masks if in crowded environments, accept the offer of a vaccine if made and discourage visits from people who are suffering from a respiratory infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid autumn vaccination booster programme launches on October 1. Care home residents, over-75s and anyone aged over six months who is immunocompromised is eligible for the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines that are on offer are extraordinarily effective,” Prof Openshaw says. “If you’re offered a vaccine, I would definitely take it and I personally have taken every offer of the vaccines I’ve been made.” The jab can reduce the likelihood of outbreaks and prevent the virus from causing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What to do if you get Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the most effective way to get over Covid is to rest at home and drink plenty of fluids and remain vigilant for worsening symptoms,” says Dr Adrian Hayter, medical director for clinical policy at the Royal College of General Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the counter medications – paracetamol or ibuprofen – can help alleviate symptoms such as aches, a sore throat or a blocked nose, and increasing airflow by sitting upright and breathing slowly can help with feelings of breathlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small group of people remain eligible for antivirals, which are medicines that stop Covid from growing and spreading through the body, including those who have certain immune conditions, blood disorders or receiving specific cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone has concerns for their health, or if their condition is getting worse or not improving, they should seek health advice to determine whether further treatment is needed,” Dr Hayter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises people with Covid symptoms to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for at least three days, while the infected should steer clear of people who have a weak immune system for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The condition is highly infectious, and some people can be particularly vulnerable to the worst effects, which is why it’s important that we take appropriate measures to avoid transmission,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen may fuel antibiotic resistance, raising urgent questions about drug interactions in aged care and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are among the most widely used pain and fever remedies, but new findings from the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-south-australia/"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; suggest they may be contributing to a global health crisis: antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pioneering study, scientists discovered that each drug on its own can encourage bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics, and when taken together, they appear to intensify this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining how these medicines interact with the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin and &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;) – a bacterium often responsible for gut and urinary tract infections – the team observed that ibuprofen and acetaminophen accelerated genetic changes, making the bacteria more resistant not only to ciprofloxacin but also to other types of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this raises significant concerns for vulnerable groups, especially older adults in residential care facilities where multiple medications are commonly prescribed. The findings highlight the need for greater caution around everyday drug use and its potential role in worsening antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are two of the most widely used over-the-counter pain relievers. Ibuprofen, sold under brand names like Advil and Motrin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain, fever, and inflammation. Acetaminophen, best known by the brand name Tylenol, is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fever but does not have anti-inflammatory effects. Both are staples in household medicine cabinets and are often considered go-to remedies for headaches, colds, and everyday aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1621" data-end="1661"&gt;Polypharmacy and Its Consequences&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher UniSA’s Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Assoc Prof Venter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications – not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure – making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut, or urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria’s defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader Medication Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery), temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance isn’t just about antibiotics anymore,” Assoc Prof Venter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications – particularly in aged care, where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This doesn’t mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics – and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering past events in minute detail, revisiting them methodically, and reliving past emotions—this is the peculiarity of people with an exceptional memory of their own lives, known as autobiographical hypermnesia, or hyperthymesia. This fascinating condition remains poorly understood, and each new case contributes to our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neurocase&lt;/i&gt;, researchers from Paris Brain Institute and the Memory, Brain, and Cognition Laboratory describe the extraordinary mental life of a 17-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autobiographical memory refers to our ability to remember experiences that have shaped our lives since childhood. It consists of emotional and sensory memories of places, moments, and people, as well as a set of factual information—such as names and dates—that allows us to orient ourselves when we try to recall an episode from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, these memories are more or less vivid depending on how old they are or how much importance we attach to them. Thanks to the dynamic nature of memory, they lose sharpness over time, fade away completely, or are partially rewritten. But a small number of people—only a handful of cases have been described in scientific literature—have access to such a wealth of autobiographical details that they can link specific events to any given date on the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, known as hyperthymesics, memories are carefully indexed by date. Some will be able to describe in detail what they did on July 6, 2002, and experience again the emotions and sensations of that day," explains Valentina La Corte, a research professor at the Memory, Brain, and Cognition Laboratory at Paris Cité University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having memories of our lives allows us to construct a narrative of ourselves and stabilize our sense of identity. Autobiographical memory is therefore associated with a type of consciousness called "autonoetic," which allows us to take a mental journey through time to relive past events, project ourselves into the future, or into imaginary situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperthymestic people can travel through time in their minds with extraordinary ease and intensity. "Studying this atypical cognitive functioning could help us better understand how autobiographical memory works, as well as the neurological disorders that affect it," says Laurent Cohen, neurologist and co-head of the PICNIC Lab at Paris Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A memory palace for organizing memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to case reports in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/scientific+literature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific literature&lt;/a&gt; and accounts in the media, hyperthymesia is often described as a distressing ability: painful, even traumatic memories can accumulate uncontrollably. Some individuals also feel overwhelmed by useless anecdotal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, La Corte and Cohen examined the case of TL, a 17-year-old girl who appears to have significant control over how she accesses her memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL distinguishes between two types. On the one hand, her "black memory" corresponds to encyclopedic knowledge mainly acquired at school and carries no particular emotional meaning. On the other hand, the memories of her life are organized within a sophisticated mental space—a kind of memory palace—that she can visualize on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are filed by theme and chronological order in binders, which are kept in a room with a very low ceiling that she calls "the white room." TL mentally scans through them to retrieve episodes related to her family life, vacations, friends, or childhood objects. Some memories are even stored in the form of text messages or photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl uses mental representation tools to isolate memories linked to negative emotions such as sadness, grief, or distress. For instance, her grandfather's death is kept in a chest inside the white room. She also uses two adjoining rooms: a "pack ice" room she uses to soothe her anger, a "problems" room to reflect on difficulties, and a "military room" populated by soldiers, which appeared in her mind when her father left home to join the army.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Assessing autobiographical memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers lack robust tools to verify whether hyperthymestic memories are reliable, especially when they concern distant periods. Like the rest of the population, hyperthymestics are prone to false memories and memory distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, La Corte and Cohen used the Episodic Test of Autobiographical Memory (&lt;a href="https://loterre.istex.fr/P66/fr/page/-KN71C2N1-W" target="_blank"&gt;TEMPau&lt;/a&gt;) and the Temporal Extended Autobiographical Memory Task (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810014001251?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;TEEAM&lt;/a&gt;), which assess how easily people can mentally travel through time, the richness of the memories they report, and how they relate to their own narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that TL relives moments of her life with exceptional intensity and vividness. Sometimes, as an external observer, sometimes as a protagonist, she can re-examine details from different points of view. When researchers asked her to imagine future events, she provided an unusually rich amount of temporal, spatial, and perceptual information, far beyond what an ordinary person can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These observations reinforce the idea that mental travel into the future relies on mechanisms similar to those used in conscious exploration of the past. In both cases, sensory information seems to play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;New avenues for research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autobiographical hypermnesia also seems closely linked to synesthesia, a neurological condition in which processing one sensory modality involves at least two senses. For example, synesthetes may hear colors, see sounds, or taste music. Even though TL is not a synesthete, several members of her family are. It would be interesting to explore this association," adds Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that hyperthymesia is associated with overactivation of brain networks involved in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autobiographical+memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt; and certain visual areas. However, no neuroanatomical differences have yet been found between hyperthymesics and individuals with typical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases. Does aging affect the memories of these individuals? Do their mental time-travel abilities depend on age? Can they learn to control the accumulation of memories? We have many questions, and everything remains to be discovered. An exciting avenue of research lies ahead," concludes La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, younger people now report the highest levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, with ill-being declining across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from millions of participants across 44 countries suggest this is a global trend. Researchers point to economic pressures, healthcare gaps, pandemic aftershocks, and social media as possible contributors, raising urgent concerns about a worsening mental health crisis among youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental distress no longer peaks in midlife but is now highest in young adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Analysis of nearly 2 million people across 44 countries confirms the trend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt; Recession impacts, weak mental health systems, pandemic effects, and social media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new survey-based study suggests that the “unhappiness hump”—a widely documented rise in worry, stress, and depression with age that peaks in midlife and then declines—may have disappeared, perhaps due to declining mental health among younger people. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College, U.S., and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; on August 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, a U-shaped trend in wellbeing with age, in which wellbeing tends to decline from childhood until around age 50 before rebounding in old age, has been observed in developed and developing countries worldwide. Data have also revealed a corresponding “ill-being” or unhappiness hump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data point to a worldwide decline in wellbeing among younger people, but most studies have not directly addressed potential implications for the unhappiness hump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help clarify, Blanchflower and colleagues first analyzed data from U.S. and U.K. surveys that included questions about participants’ mental health. U.S. data included responses from more than 10 million adults surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1993 and 2024. U.K. data spanned 2009 through 2023 and were collected in the ongoing U.K. Household Longitudinal Study, which involves 40,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that, in the U.S. and the U.K., the ill-being hump has disappeared, such that ill-being  / unhappiness now tends to decline over the course of a lifetime. Ill-being among people in their late 40s and older did not change significantly. Instead, the hump’s disappearance appears to be due to a decline in mental health among younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers analyzed data on nearly 2 million people from 44 countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., from a mental health study called Global Minds. Covering the years 2020 through 2025, these data suggest the unhappiness hump has disappeared worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for the disappearance of the unhappiness hump are unclear. The authors suggest several possibilities, including long-term impacts of the Great Recession on job prospects for younger people, underfunded mental health care services, mental health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to determine whether any of these or other factors are at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Ours is the first paper to show that the decline in young people’s mental health in recent years means that today, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, mental ill-being is highest among the young and declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a huge change from the past when mental ill-being peaked in middle-age. The reasons for the change are disputed but our concern is that today there is a serious mental health crisis among the young that needs addressing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0afaea5b0b2a5b3b380b0acafb3eeafb2a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The declining mental health of the young and the global disappearance of the unhappiness hump shape in age&lt;/a&gt;” by Alex Bryson et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The declining mental health of the young and the global disappearance of the unhappiness hump shape in age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across many studies subjective well-being has followed a U-shape in age, declining until people reach middle-age, only to rebound subsequently. Ill-being has followed a mirror-imaged hump-shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using graphical and regression analyses of repeat cross-sectional micro-data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show this empirical regularity has been replaced by a monotonic decrease in ill-being by age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the change is the deterioration in young people’s mental health both absolutely and relative to older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooling Global Minds data across 44 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, over the period 2020–2025 we confirm that ill-being is no longer hump-shaped in age but now decreases in age.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Two people have died after eating Louisiana oysters infected with a&lt;a href="/article/news/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-louisiana-department-of-health-warns-of-potentially-deadly-infection/289-3b175c98-a155-4fde-abc4-505ab7582383"&gt; flesh eating bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. WBRZ reports the oysters were harvested in Louisiana before being served at restaurants in both Louisiana and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials said 14 others were also infected with Vibrio vulnificus&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a serious bacterial infection, after eating the oysters, &lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/two-more-people-dead-after-eating-louisiana-oysters-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria"&gt;our partners reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Vibrio vulnificus has caused 34 infections and six deaths — the highest total Louisiana has seen in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just prolific right now,” said Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator with the Louisiana Department of Health. She shared the update during a meeting with the Louisiana Oyster Task Force on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seafood businesses said the state enforces strict harvesting and safety protocols. Restaurants are also required by law to post warnings about the risks of eating raw oysters and seafood.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions that can help keep you safe according to the Louisiana Department of Health:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay out of brackish or salt water if you have a wound (including cuts and scrapes), or cover your wound with a waterproof bandage if there's a possibility it could come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they have been exposed to brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you develop a skin infection, tell your medical provider if your skin has come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use caution when consuming raw or undercooked seafood, especially if you have a weakened immune system, are pregnant, or have certain medical conditions like liver or stomach disorders. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contaminating cooked seafood with raw seafood and their juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are in a group at higher risk for severe infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear clothes and shoes that can protect you from cuts and scrapes when in brackish or salt water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear protective gloves when handling raw seafood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists are making encouraging progress in developing vaccines to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172285" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but so far the therapies have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-vaccine-for-two-deadly-cancers-shows-promise-in-clinical-trial"&gt;restricted to specific types of tumor&lt;/a&gt;. Now new research points the way to a universal vaccine that could attack a wider range of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research led by a team at the University of Florida focuses on "&lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;waking up&lt;/a&gt;" the immune system to better respond to more types of cancerous cell – tumors that would otherwise be missed for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anti-cancer reaction," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Duane Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-teas-temperature-could-put-you-at-risk-of-some-cancers"&gt;Your Tea's Temperature Could Put You at Risk of Some Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And so this has significant potential to be broadly used across cancer patients – even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine itself uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; to produce signaling proteins known to elicit a pronounced immune response, effectively mobilizing the immune system in a way that makes cancerous tissues more sensitive to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the materials created by the vaccine's mRNA weren't specific to the cancer tumors that were treated, but rather enhanced a reaction from dormant cells that weren't typically associated with a cancer response. It's like a one-size-fits-all siren for our body's border patrol – and that suggests it could have broad application potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172288" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph.jpg" alt="Tumour graph" class="wp-image-172288 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The vaccine (uRNA) and anti-cancer drugs (PD-L1 mAb) had a significant impact on tumors. (Qdaisat et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Biomed. Eng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second component to the treatment uses common anti-cancer drugs called immune &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_inhibitor"&gt;checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (ICIs). These essentially remove some of the brakes on the immune system, making it even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ICIs have been successfully used against cancers in the past, tumors with numerous mutations can develop resistance to their attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both the vaccine and the ICIs were used together on mice with tumors, the researchers saw a strong tumor-fighting response, even against cancerous growths that are normally resistant to treatments. Some tumors were eliminated entirely in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the vaccine worked effectively on its own in certain scenarios, the best results were seen in combination with ICIs. The combined therapy still needs to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;tested in people&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172285" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to determine its effectiveness and safety, but the preclinical results suggest the approach is worth exploring further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding is a proof of concept that these vaccines potentially could be commercialized as universal cancer vaccines to sensitize the immune system against a patient's individual tumor," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; oncologist Elias Sayour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is already busy working on new formulations of their mRNA vaccine, and clinical trials are planned. This also needs to be tested in a wider range of scenarios – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-of-elevated-cancer-risk-in-elite-runners-can-be-explained"&gt;preventing cancer&lt;/a&gt; from coming back, for example, as well as treating it when it's recently been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might also be ways to recognize patients who would be more likely to benefit from this type of vaccine than others. Researchers are tackling the challenge of fighting cancer from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-holy-grail-protein-repairs-dna-and-could-lead-to-a-cancer-vaccine"&gt;multiple different angles&lt;/a&gt;, and we're probably going to need all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever tweaking the immune system is involved, there's always the danger of side effects and responses &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immune-response-thought-to-aid-cancer-could-be-an-unexpected-cure"&gt;that eventually harm&lt;/a&gt; rather than help the body – but from the results so far, this new vaccine approach seems to be a promising one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could potentially be a universal way of waking up a patient's own immune response to cancer," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that would be profound if generalizable to human studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01380-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="313" data-end="461"&gt;Aging well isn’t about miracle supplements or pricey wellness trends. Increasingly, doctors point to something much simpler: what’s on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="463" data-end="774"&gt;Research shows that eating more plants can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improve energy levels, and even protect brain health as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="463" data-end="774"&gt;Case in point: The &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Principles-of-the-Blue-Zone-Diet.aspx"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; (regions of the world where people routinely live past 90 in good health) all share one thing in common — a diet that’s largely plant-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="776" data-end="1031"&gt;But within the wide world of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, certain foods stand out for their ability to support healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="776" data-end="1031"&gt;Here are ten that doctors and nutrition experts consistently highlight — and easy ways to bring them to your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1033" data-end="1053"&gt;1. Leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1055" data-end="1289"&gt;Spinach, kale, Swiss chard, arugula — doctors often group these under one umbrella: nature’s multivitamins. Rich in vitamin K, calcium, and antioxidants, leafy greens are particularly powerful for bone health and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1291" data-end="1524"&gt;Research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263222/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that people who regularly ate leafy greens experienced slower rates of cognitive decline compared to those who rarely did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1291" data-end="1524"&gt;That means your daily salad could be protecting your memory decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1526" data-end="1668"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1526" data-end="1537"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend spinach into smoothies, sauté kale with garlic, or toss arugula into grain bowls. The fresher and more varied, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1670" data-end="1685"&gt;2. Berries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="1910"&gt;Doctors often call berries “brain food,” and for good reason. Blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries are packed with anthocyanins — compounds that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, two major drivers of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2087"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that regular berry consumption can improve memory and support heart health. They also deliver fiber, which helps maintain steady blood sugar and gut balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2089" data-end="2254"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2089" data-end="2100"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a handful of berries to oatmeal, yogurt alternatives, or even savory salads for a sweet-tart boost. Frozen berries are just as nutritious as fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2256" data-end="2271"&gt;3. Legumes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2273" data-end="2507"&gt;Beans, lentils, and chickpeas are staples in long-lived cultures around the world. Doctors love them because they provide plant-based protein, iron, and soluble fiber — which lowers cholesterol and supports a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2509" data-end="2681"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6855964/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; links legume-rich diets to lower risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. They’re also affordable and versatile, making them a true backbone of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2683" data-end="2827"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2683" data-end="2694"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a lentil soup, chickpea salad, or black bean tacos. Cooking a large batch at once makes them easy to add throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2829" data-end="2851"&gt;4. Nuts and seeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2853" data-end="3113"&gt;Doctors consistently recommend nuts and seeds for longevity. They deliver healthy fats, vitamin E, and plant compounds that protect against cardiovascular disease. Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds also support brain health and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3115" data-end="3314"&gt;One large &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/eating-nuts-reduces-risk-of-death/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who ate nuts daily had a 20% lower risk of dying from any cause over a 30-year period. That’s a remarkable return from something as simple as a handful of walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3115" data-end="3314"&gt;(And it's certainly welcome news for me, a certified nut addict!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3316" data-end="3447"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3316" data-end="3327"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle seeds on oatmeal or salads, keep almonds on hand for snacks, or blend cashews into creamy dairy-free sauces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3449" data-end="3469"&gt;5. Whole grains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3471" data-end="3727"&gt;Whole grains like oats, quinoa, brown rice, and barley are linked to healthier hearts and longer lives. Doctors emphasize them because they’re rich in fiber, B vitamins, and magnesium — nutrients that support digestion, energy, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3729" data-end="3919"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000001031"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, replacing refined grains with whole grains can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3921" data-end="4049"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3921" data-end="3932"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Build bowls around quinoa, swap white rice for brown, or keep overnight oats in the fridge for a simple breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4051" data-end="4081"&gt;6. Cruciferous vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4083" data-end="4324"&gt;Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage are in a league of their own. Thanks to their sulforaphane content — a compound shown to help the body detoxify harmful substances and even protect against certain cancers — these veggies have earned a regular spot on many doctors’ “must-eat” lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="461" data-end="846"&gt;They’re also loaded with vitamin C, folate, and fiber, all of which support resilience as the body ages. Folate helps with cell repair and brain health, vitamin C protects skin and connective tissues, and fiber keeps digestion running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="461" data-end="846"&gt;It’s no wonder people who regularly include cruciferous vegetables in their diets are often found to have lower risks of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="848" data-end="1123"&gt;The best part? They’re incredibly versatile. Whether roasted until crispy, shaved raw into salads, or blended into soups, these vegetables adapt to just about any cuisine. Making them a staple doesn’t have to feel like a chore — it can actually make meals more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1125" data-end="1285"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1125" data-end="1136"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a quick broccoli pesto for pasta, toss shredded cabbage into tacos, or roast Brussels sprouts with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic glaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4652" data-end="4688"&gt;7. Dark chocolate (yes, really)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4690" data-end="4957"&gt;Doctors often highlight dark chocolate — in moderation — as a surprisingly beneficial food for aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4690" data-end="4957"&gt;High-quality, minimally processed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589144/"&gt;dark chocolate contains flavonoids&lt;/a&gt; that support heart health, reduce inflammation, and may even improve circulation to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4959" data-end="5128"&gt;It’s also a mood booster, which matters just as much for longevity as physical health. The key is to choose varieties with at least 70% cacao and keep portions modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5272"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5130" data-end="5141"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy a square of dark chocolate with tea, melt it over fruit, or add cacao powder to smoothies for a rich, nutrient-dense kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5274" data-end="5290"&gt;8. Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="107" data-end="399"&gt;Here’s good news for anyone who loves pasta sauce or a simple tomato salad: tomatoes are one of the most powerful foods you can eat for healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="107" data-end="399"&gt;They’re packed with lycopene, an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC80172/"&gt;antioxidant linked&lt;/a&gt; to stronger heart health, sharper vision, and protection against cell damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="401" data-end="630"&gt;Even better, cooking actually boosts their benefits. Lycopene becomes more available to the body when tomatoes are simmered or roasted, so dishes like tomato soup or marinara aren’t just comforting — they’re quietly protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="632" data-end="789"&gt;Add in their vitamin C and potassium content, and tomatoes prove that an everyday ingredient can punch far above its weight in supporting long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="791" data-end="906"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="791" data-end="802"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend roasted tomatoes into soups, simmer them into stews, or enjoy fresh cherry tomatoes as a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5809" data-end="5826"&gt;9. Mushrooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5828" data-end="6110"&gt;Doctors often highlight &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-mushrooms"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; for their immune-boosting properties and unique compounds like beta-glucans and ergothioneine, an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5828" data-end="6110"&gt;Some varieties, such as shiitake and maitake, are also known for supporting cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6112" data-end="6283"&gt;And here’s the kicker: mushrooms are one of the few plant-based sources of vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making them especially valuable for bone health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6285" data-end="6420"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6285" data-end="6296"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Sauté mushrooms as a savory side, add them to stir-fries, or roast them until crisp for a meaty, nutrient-packed topping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6422" data-end="6445"&gt;10. Sweet potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="142" data-end="392"&gt;Few comfort foods carry as much nutritional power as sweet potatoes. Beneath their natural sweetness lies a storehouse of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A — essential for protecting vision and supporting a strong immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="686"&gt;They also deliver fiber and complex carbohydrates that release energy slowly, keeping blood sugar steady and fueling the body without spikes and crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="686"&gt;In many long-lived cultures, root vegetables like sweet potatoes are everyday staples, forming the base of nourishing, affordable meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="688" data-end="874"&gt;Their versatility is another reason they shine. Sweet potatoes can go savory or sweet, mashed or roasted, side dish or centerpiece — always satisfying and always packed with nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="876" data-end="1014"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="876" data-end="887"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Bake sweet potato wedges, mash them with a drizzle of olive oil, or slice them into thin rounds for quick, oven-free toasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6985" data-end="7004"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging doesn’t come down to a single superfood or a rigid diet plan. It’s about weaving small, consistent choices into the fabric of daily life — the kind of choices that keep your heart strong, your memory sharp, and your meals joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these ten foods remarkable is that they aren’t exotic or inaccessible. They’re simple ingredients you can find at any grocery store, each carrying a quiet power to support the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of chasing the next big wellness trend, consider reaching for what’s already familiar: a handful of nuts, a bowl of lentils, a roasted sweet potato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because often, the path to a long and vibrant life isn’t about reinventing how we eat — it’s about appreciating the foods that have been nourishing us all along.&lt;/p&gt;

And 25,000 children — one in every classroom of 25 — had long-term symptoms of the virus, which without treatment, destroys the body’s immune system, turning even common infections deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, new infections in kids are so exceedingly rare — at under 100 per year — that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/22/botswana-health-hiv-aids-disease-africa-mothers-babies-extinction-cure"&gt;every infant diagnosed with HIV now prompts a comprehensive audit&lt;/a&gt; by the country’s public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is a remarkable turnaround. While &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS?end=2022&amp;amp;most_recent_value_desc=true&amp;amp;start=2022&amp;amp;view=bar"&gt;Botswana’s HIV rate&lt;/a&gt; is still the fourth-highest in the world — &lt;a href="https://www.statsbots.org.bw/hiv-prevalence-rates-district-and-age-15-64-years"&gt;affecting up to a third of adults in some regions&lt;/a&gt; — the number of babies born with HIV today is virtually zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It took time to pay off, but Botswana has managed to build the most robust HIV prevention infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for pregnant women and children. &lt;a href="https://millionssaved.cgdev.org/case-studies/botswanas-mass-antiretroviral-therapy-program"&gt;Life-saving antiretroviral therapies&lt;/a&gt; — which can transform HIV into a manageable and largely untransmittable chronic condition — have been widely available for free in the country since 2002. The nation’s government launched a program to prevent mother-to-child transmissions in 1999, &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/botswana/news/world-health-day-botswana-renews-commitment-ending-preventable-maternal-deaths"&gt;expanded its free coverage of maternal services&lt;/a&gt; over the years, and became one of the first countries to implement the &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2021/december/emtct_botswana"&gt;World Health Organization’s Option B+ strategy in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, making a highly effective lifelong treatment regimen freely available to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Thanks to those sustained public investments, Botswana became the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-05-2025-botswana-advances-to-gold-tier-on-the-path-to-elimination-of-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv"&gt;first country in the world with a high HIV rate to achieve&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organization’s Gold Tier status for eliminating mother-to-child or “vertical” transmissions as a public health threat earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Botswana shows you know what can happen when a country decides that no child should be born with HIV, and they actually mean it,” said Doris Macharia, president of the &lt;a href="https://pedaids.org/"&gt;Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, who began her career at the height of the HIV epidemic, working as a physician in her native Kenya and at a rural clinic in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even in the face of global aid cuts, which have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/health/hiv-aids-pepfar-funding-trump.html"&gt;stripped billions from highly effective HIV prevention programs&lt;/a&gt;, progress like Botswana’s proves that the hardest-hit countries are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’ve made phenomenal progress,” she said, “but we still have a long way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A young woman living in Botswana in 1997 had a &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/"&gt;one in four chance of contracting HIV&lt;/a&gt;. If she had three children in the years that followed, at least one of her babies would almost surely contract the virus during pregnancy or childbirth, or while breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But if her HIV-positive daughter, now a young woman, became pregnant today, her chance of transmitting the virus to her own children would be &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/esa/press-releases/botswana-key-milestone-elimination-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission"&gt;less than 1 percent&lt;/a&gt; — down from &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/ce_BW_Narrative_Report%5B1%5D.pdf"&gt;up to 40 percent three decades prior.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For starters, antiretroviral therapies have gotten much better, cheaper, and infinitely more accessible than a few decades ago. About 98 percent of &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org?did=5b4eaa7cdddb54192bb39714&amp;amp;r=world&amp;amp;t=2024&amp;amp;tb=g&amp;amp;bt=gnli&amp;amp;ts=0,0&amp;amp;gid=55826d0f4e45852d435461fc&amp;amp;gr=BWA"&gt;HIV-positive pregnant women in Botswana&lt;/a&gt; now access those medications, which can suppress the virus enough that it is virtually undetectable and by extension, largely untransmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When babies are born with HIV today, it’s not because their mothers can’t access treatment, but because they didn’t know they had the virus to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“Not all countries are created equally, but all countries have an opportunity to step up and mobilize support — to move this needle for children and moms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Doris Macharia, president of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in Botswana, &lt;a href="https://www.statsbots.org.bw/sites/default/files/publications/Botswana%20Maternal%20Mortality%20Ratio%20%202019.pdf"&gt;99.8 percent of pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; give birth in a hospital or clinic and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-05-2025-botswana-advances-to-gold-tier-on-the-path-to-elimination-of-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv"&gt;95 percent access&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/botswana/news/world-health-day-botswana-renews-commitment-ending-preventable-maternal-deaths"&gt;country’s free prenatal and maternal care services&lt;/a&gt; — up from &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25475345"&gt;70 percent in 2001&lt;/a&gt;. This puts them &lt;a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/data?reg=99&amp;amp;top=5&amp;amp;stop=34&amp;amp;lev=1&amp;amp;slev=4&amp;amp;obj=1"&gt;on par with the United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/antenatal-care/"&gt;far ahead of neighbors like Zimbabwe.&lt;/a&gt; That makes it easy to routinely screen for HIV over the course of a pregnancy — and to immediately test any newborns at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“There’s no mom who wants her child to be sick,” Macharia said. “There’s no mom who wants her child to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Altogether, these interventions and policies have &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/"&gt;prevented about 59,000 children from being infected with HIV&lt;/a&gt; since Botswana enacted a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4087192/"&gt;nationwide campaign against vertical transmissions&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, according to estimates from UNAIDS, the United Nations partnership to fight HIV/AIDS. Globally, similar policies have &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/?did=5b4eaa7cdddb54192bb39714&amp;amp;r=world&amp;amp;t=2024&amp;amp;tb=g&amp;amp;bt=ggli&amp;amp;ts=0,0&amp;amp;gid=55685194c80b05217b392438&amp;amp;gr="&gt;prevented over 4 million childhood infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Macharia attributed Botswana’s success not only to effective interventions, but to political will: Its government recognized the severity of the crisis relatively early on, and then consistently funded its own interventions. President Festus Mogae made combating HIV a top priority of his administration when he took office at the height of the crisis in 1998. After taking office, he quickly launched the campaign against vertical transmissions in 1999, became the &lt;a href="https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/74914"&gt;first head of state to publicly test himself for HIV&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and established Africa’s first &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261699321_Outcomes_of_the_Botswana_national_HIVAIDS_treatment_programme_from_2002_to_2010_A_longitudinal_analysis"&gt;national antiretroviral treatment program&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Not all countries are created equally,” Macharia said, “but all countries have an opportunity to step up and mobilize support — to move this needle for children and moms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="an-aids-free-generation-within-reach" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AIDS-free generation within reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, how did the country pull it off? With its vast diamond reserves, Botswana is relatively wealthy — even &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/botswana-president-declares-public-health-emergency-medicine-supply-shortages"&gt;despite recent downturns in the market&lt;/a&gt;. The country’s per capita income is closer to that of Mexico or Brazil than to many of its sub-Saharan neighbors, and it has the &lt;a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024"&gt;lowest corruption rate in Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And while American global aid programs like the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402944/pepfar-hiv-donald-trump-elon-musk-global-health"&gt;President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;) have been essential partners in its HIV response, the country &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/pepfar-impact-Botswana"&gt;pays its own way &lt;/a&gt;for about 70 percent of its HIV prevention programs, said Alankar Malviya, Botswana country director for UNAIDS. Other poorer countries in Africa, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246094/"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mozambique.pdf#:~:text=Strategic%20investments%2C%20efficiency%2C%20and%20sustainable%20financing.%20Regarding,for%20opportunistic%20infections%20is%20still%20a%20challenge."&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2025/february/20250218_weekly-update-impact-us-shift"&gt;Côte d’Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, rely on foreign aid for 80 or 90 percent of such funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s made it harder for those nations to replicate Botswana’s cohesive national strategy — especially with &lt;a href="/future-perfect/404040/foreign-aid-cuts-trump-charts-usaid-pepfar-who-hiv"&gt;today’s torrent of cuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;“The pace at which the global funding landscape for HIV has changed in the last few months is unprecedented,” Malviya said. “You cannot prepare any country for having to go through such a radical change in funding, which meant putting a pause to ongoing programs overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A lot of countries were already on their way to building roadmaps to fund their own programs in the long run, he said, but “you cannot sustain a program overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the meantime, many are looking to Botswana — the first country to &lt;a href="https://pharosglobalhealth.com/projects/botswana-hiv-sustainability-and-transition-roadmap/"&gt;pioneer a roadmap for sustainably financing HIV prevention&lt;/a&gt;— for help. The country’s public health officials have advised Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe and other countries on how to sustain their progress and diversify their funding in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’ve done so much to get to where we are, and we have so little to go,” Macharia said. Though “the last mile is always the hardest,” she thinks an AIDS-free generation is still very much in sight: “We are very, very close. We are extremely close.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNZmUyTk15c2RZdFJvSmJaWm9VMjE2NU8zdTJMdnh6ODRvUzZ1X0I5MXVNcEdWZjJUbTRWQk5WRWdVanl5emtUdWYwVmh0bXVWaF9iODA4WXlqRUZjYTdIeVNjbE0xbTRjcjNydzF3LU1FV1p5NVE1SGdQV2REM3BvS0hRWUFFaW9URWZSY2RIU19UTHJyeEozOHlWTjU</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.通过新规则调整新冠疫苗政策- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/08/28/new-covid-vaccine-restriction-rules-rfk-fda</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:28:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNQkRvSlBXa1lMeGo5LWpKZGU1bkRLZGdGakY3V3JkVk9oTDZzalBmbHBfbHVydGtPY1BnY3Y1WHpFcWxhMEdPVk41elJmcWRMX0x2eDVfZUdReG4tZG8xQnBxeGVnQ0lMNGNDNXliT1EybEcxeFFTb2VRcUUzMFpjNFhR</guid></item><item><title>医生不会告诉你这一点-但作为一名心脏外科医生，我知道一个简单的日常锻炼可以挽救你的生命-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15042393/heart-surgeon-daily-exercise-save-life-instagram-walk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sacrificing half an hour of sitting down for a brisk walk everyday could slash&lt;span&gt; the risk of developing life-threatening heart failure, a heart surgeon has urged. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's long been known that regular exercise reduces the risk of major illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7b88e180-8400-11f0-9b1d-8d4b4183d85e"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-7b886c50-8400-11f0-9b1d-8d4b4183d85e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7b8a6820-8400-11f0-9b1d-8d4b4183d85e"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends all adults should be physically active every day — ideally mixing muscle building and aerobic workouts, aiming for 150 minutes a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, US-based cardiologist Dr Dmitry Yaranov has warned that moving around more each day, even just for minutes at a time, could vastly reduce the odds of suffering 'deadly clots', which raise the risk of heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN1BKI8QABS/"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;, watched more than 3.6 million times, he said: 'Most doctors never mention this.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You don't have one heart, you have two. The first is in your chest. The second is in your calves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every step, every heal raise, every muscle squeeze pushes blood back to your real heart, keeps your circulation alive, and stops deadly clots from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But here's the problem. Our modern lifestyle is killing it. We sit for hours. We walk less than ever. We lose muscle as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US-based cardiologist Dr Dmitry Yaranov has warned that moving around more each day, even just for minutes at a time, could vastly reduce the odds of suffering 'deadly clots', which raise the risk of heart issues &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your "second heart" fails, your first one is forced to work harder—circulation slows, swelling begins, blood pressure rises, and your risk of heart failure skyrockets.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Move. Walk daily. Do heel raises at your desk. Take the stairs. Keep your calf muscles strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't wait until it's too late—start today. Your future self will thank you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously studies have shown walking 10,000 steps a day can lower risk of heart disease, cancer and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14937193/scientists-reveal-number-daily-steps-prevent-dementia.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested just 7,000 steps a day was enough to lower risk of dementia, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also suggested the pace we walk may be just as important.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, US scientists who studied more than 79,850 adults found a short brisk was more beneficial than walking at a slower pace for three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a worrying &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14724297/heart-health-declining-record-rate.html"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in heart-related deaths in the UK, which have soared 18 per cent from 18,693 to 21,975 between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), there has also been a 21 per cent rise in the number of people being diagnosed with heart failure since 2020—the highest on record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of people with atrial fibrillation—irregular heartbeat—has also increased to a record high—1.62 million up from 1.48 million over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF analysis also revealed an 83 per cent rise in the number of people waiting for planned heart hospital treatment in England, from the start of the decade to March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiac waiting lists have also grown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF said the concerning shift follows decades of progress that had seen annual deaths from conditions like a heart attack and stroke half since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity suggested the rise could be driven by a rise in processed foods and unhealthy diets, the impact of Covid infections on the heart and circulatory system as well as disruption to routine and GP appointments and heart care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:19:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWFR3bXZqM1RKaWl5NGk0Ny15cG1NbEFFUUpVMVdSVGVGbTB0R1lZekRRdTkyNVF0X1VrcDZ3amh2VnJxcFJ1cW1oV1o0WVhYTENsUnlKa1NwSl9pWXB0TzhMXzR2ZTZwQ0dmQ2twVzI0QnRwa1pnazBoZHJKbWtTaUJPMFAxS3FOMm5mb1I2RDdra1Fwbm1IN0E3WDBiZ1FaUjFRQV8yU3QwSGw2QkFR0gG0AUFVX3lxTE85Q0ZVZTdheUMwMG1fbk4yM1EtYU1vQWo0T3VJQUEwTzN6WlgzeWdaT3BxMFNxVDlEMTByaWRYWXd2MTBoZ2xxSDljcklNVk1PdGZlVElTbmM5VXFGQ0Qtek90YmVSVXBzSnpNYUhTOVFRdWkyNTZETGYyX1ZweEx3elFzQklwalJSaDhZVmtscnVLZG1FWHRUYzJpaU5JX2ZaYWdOd2U4WUhKUzNpTWlFMkJkRw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现另一种可能彻底改变减肥药物的激素- bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://bestlifeonline.com/amylin-weight-loss-drugs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content noskimwords"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amylin functions similarly to semaglutides in the body.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Science Signaling: Amylin receptor subunit interactions are modulated by agonists and determine signaling" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.adt8127" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Aug. 19, researchers at the University of Oklahoma announced that they had finally uncovered new information on how the hormone amylin was activated within the body, making it more accessible for the next generation of pharmaceutical development for weight management medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the pancreas &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095252" target="_blank"&gt;produces and secretes amylin&lt;/a&gt; alongside insulin whenever a person eats, according to a press release. The hormone not only helps regulate blood sugar levels, but it also helps control appetite and feelings of hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s similar to the semaglutide used by GLP-1-style medications such as Wegovy and Ozempic, which interact with the same family of receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has been a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical industry for developing new obesity drugs,” &lt;strong&gt;Sandra Gostynska&lt;/strong&gt;, the paper’s lead author and doctoral student at the University of Oklahoma, said in a statement. “What we have done is given the field new tools for understanding how a drug can affect amylin receptors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new research produced significant results for weight loss.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists took away at least two significant findings from the research paper. The first pertains to our understanding of the three amylin receptors, which appear similar but are actually composed of slightly different subcomponents that make them more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team likens this to a group of people who may be wearing an identical outfit, but each has unique accessories that differentiate them from the others. They explained that this breakthrough will allow them to focus on the required elements (which in this case is controlling appetite) to help minimize side effects of future medications while maximizing effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major takeaway also pertained to the receptors’ subunits, but centered on medications’ future potential to “pull the subunits together or push them apart.” The researchers said this newfound understanding could help in the engineering of new drugs to produce different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This paper shows the new biochemical and pharmacological methods we developed that will enable the field, for the first time, to understand exactly what drugs in development do at each of the three amylin receptors,” &lt;strong&gt;Augen Pioszak&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, the paper’s senior author and an associate professor of biochemistry and physiology at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amylin receptors are very complicated, and each has very different and unique properties. What we have discovered has eluded researchers for many years, and we believe our findings will advance drug development,” Pioszak added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Companies are already trying to develop amylin-based drugs.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest findings could significantly speed the development of a new style of drugs that’s already underway. Last September, pharmaceutical company and Ozempic developer Novo Nordisk announced that it had seen success in a Phase I trial of a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/10/novo-nordisk-amylin-pill-weight-loss-study/" target="_blank"&gt;new obesity pill&lt;/a&gt; targeting amylin known as amycretin, STAT reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results found that patients taking a 50mg daily dose of the medication saw a 10.4 percent weight loss over the roughly three-month trial period. Those taking a double dose saw even more pounds shed with 13.1 percent weight loss, compared to a 1.1 percent weight loss for participants taking a placebo pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists involved in the latest research paper say their findings could help others better understand how to progress with their next generation of medications, shedding much-needed light on a previously unknown topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe our findings will further the study of drugs because what pharmaceutical and biotech companies want to know is what their drug does at each amylin receptor,” Pioszak said in the press release. “Now we have a method of answering those questions that were previously unanswerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

can have serious effects on our physical health - but what about our mental health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of 17- to 25-year-olds has&lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/teenagers-sleep-test-scores-tired-bed-time-b2737587.html"&gt;

a 13-day study of 818 New Zealand adults who were asked to keep a daily diary; and an eight-day diary study of 236 New Zealand adults who also wore Fitbits tracking physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better sleep quality was strongly associated with better mental wellbeing across all three studies, and eating fruit and vegetables came second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity was also linked to better wellbeing when researchers compared how an individual felt between days rather than when comparing a group of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also found that above-average intake of fruits and vegetables appeared to mitigate the effects of a poor night’s sleep, and a good night’s sleep appeared to protect against lower fruit and vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Boosting fruit and vegetable intake could potentially help mitigate the negative effects a poor night’s sleep has on mental health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-4966"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Boosting fruit and vegetable intake could potentially help mitigate the negative effects a poor night’s sleep has on mental health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Professor Tamlin Conner, of the University of Otago psychology department, said: “Understanding what lifestyle factors support wellbeing can help young adults not just ‘get by’ but thrive during this critical life stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of these healthy habits, sleep quality stood out as the strongest and most consistent predictor of next-day wellbeing, but eating fruit and vegetables and being active also helped boost wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age group faces unique pressures – such as leaving home, financial stress, educational pressures and social stressors – that can lower happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting plenty of sleep doesn’t just benefit mental health but brain function generally, especially in teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate study of 3,000 young people by researchers at University of Cambridge and Fudan University in China found that those who got an early night, slept longer and had the lowest sleeping heart rates would outperform others on reading, vocabulary, problem solving and other mental tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS explained how age does play a role in how much sleep a person needs. While most healthy adults need seven to nine hours a night, teenagers, children and babies need more sleep because they are still growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOTWxXckNCY2F0UWNVWGJHWFFyUXR6cGY5TVVmSjNQSEtRZmNlOXpBcnA4Vy14aUxmS3R1MmpEQl9tcW45eWI3NjVDaXhjR1Y1c29fSXNGSEc5Y3lYSnJKV3B5QmMxaVo3WGxRSGU1VmhVU0tqejJuaVJtWDJWRTQ3Zkh1SXl4Ul8zd3pndTZMNzhQbmwzRkpRTEsxQjJIekwxQmdQSzhheTdfX1hVR3RYQg</guid></item><item><title>佐治亚州肿瘤学家解释了肺癌人口统计学变化的原因- AJC.com</title><link>https://www.ajc.com/wellness/2025/08/more-nonsmokers-are-getting-lung-cancer-a-georgia-oncologist-explains-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-contentElements" data-start-index="5"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-portrait" data-index="7"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: Northside Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: Northside Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="8"&gt;Today, nonsmokers account for 20% of lung cancer deaths, &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/for-patients/lung-cancer-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Lung Cancer Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, making it the fifth-leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. According to Bonta, people are seeing cases earlier in life — in their 40s, 30s and even 20s — because of multiple risk factors, like secondhand smoke and air pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Younger patients are also making lung cancer harder to detect, because many do not know the signs or symptoms. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;“With younger people, and especially nonsmokers, the problems tend to be mistaken for allergies or asthma,” Bonta explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="13"&gt;According to Bonta, lung cancer symptoms are typically respiratory. People should look out for persistent coughs or bouts of shortness of breath. Unintentional weight loss is also a significant sign of lung cancer — and many other types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;“If they don’t go away, we have to look into it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;Anyone who has been a consistent smoker of anything, not just cigarettes, in the past 15 years should immediately schedule a checkup if they feel any of these symptoms. At Stage 1 or 2, lung cancer can often be successfully treated, Bonta said. Treatment can bring it down to a chronic disease similar to diabetes — even at Stage 3 or 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="16"&gt;One of her patients, Joanne Cure, came to Bonta with Stage 4 lung cancer that had spread to her brain. She first went to the doctor after having a dry cough that would not go away and kept escalating in frequency and length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;“I think the general public will be shocked at how many people just walking around are fighting cancer,” Cure told the AJC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;Cure had never been a smoker. However, she had a 30-year career as a flight attendant, where she experienced a lot of secondhand smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;“I’d read through the news that contact smoke was probably not a good thing. I never thought about it when I was flying, though,” she said. “Being a nonsmoker, I didn’t really think about it being harmful to me personally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;Pollution and other environmental factors may be causes of the sudden growth in lung cancer cases for nonsmokers, Bonta explained. Similarly, genetics and other familial factors can also play a part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;Kimberly Goodloe said she has no idea why her 53-year-old sister, Dr. Karen Leigh Bryant, was diagnosed with lung cancer after a lifetime of not smoking. Bryant first went to the hospital in February 2022 with heavy abdominal issues. There, she learned she had Stage 4 lung cancer. About six weeks later, on April 30, 2022, Bryant died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;“That motivated me because I didn’t want that to be the end of her story,” Goodloe shared. “I stood and made a decision in the hospital hallways to do whatever I needed to continue her fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;In the years since, Goodloe has learned a lot about how the disease affects nonsmokers and how patients can best advocate for themselves if they receive a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;Most strongly, she echoes Bonta and recommends early screening whenever you feel something could be wrong, especially in the respiratory department. She recommends people be proactive with any questions they may have, even bringing a list to doctors appointments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;“If you have problems communicating with your doctor, bring someone to help you relay your message or write the questions and concerns down prior to your visit,” Goodloe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;Goodloe also recommends seeking resources for the entire family, including caregivers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="32"&gt;Four years after Cure’s original diagnosis, she is in remission and has MRI and CT scans every three months — and recently had another clear checkup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="34"&gt;“I don’t obsess about it. It’s in my rearview mirror,” Cure said. “I think it’s the best way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:16:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPbzkyM01zYUtvVVhDMXdsQlRWaWNRSGkyb190Y0w0eHcyeUNXLXBiUE9sVzI0TjVWbUg5UGF2WUhRdENmQWJtUDdQMDdUREEtQko4SVJSb2VJbnlnTWpjVzRqTUJpWXRlc0pVbjV0bkVZS0J6ZXZSZWIxcFEzYVZHQUtzV1g4eVpTOUdfdjlIb3J6dzBCS1lWRXlnd1ZmOEtWYXpTNnRqcGdkWEZ6UDJvag</guid></item><item><title>夏洛特县在浣熊确诊病例后发出狂犬病警报- WINK新闻</title><link>https://www.winknews.com/news/charlotte/charlotte-county-issues-rabies-alert-after-case-from-raccoon/article_99f9a9f0-1f73-4f5b-b598-85088df3b10b.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

The CDC said it was assessing the outbreak's size and impact, noting that travel health notices alert people to risks and advise on prevention measures, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/cdc-weighs-travel-notice-for-china-as-chikungunya-cases-rise" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, the CDC has issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Level 2 alert;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Level 2 alert&lt;/a&gt;, meaning travelers should "practice enhanced precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya, spread by Aedes mosquitoes, often causes a fever that comes on suddenly and severe joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet. The CDC warns that older adults are especially vulnerable, and recent safety reviews have paused use of the live-virus chikungunya vaccine in people over 60. With European regulators also reassessing its use, prevention hinges on bite protection — a challenge in densely populated, humid areas such as Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this chikungunya outbreak important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While outbreaks typically happen in tropical and subtropical regions, warmer global conditions are expanding mosquitoes' range. The World Health Organization issued a warning in July after similar outbreaks in Indian Ocean islands showed signs of escalating into an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This outbreak is yet another example of how rising global temperatures are helping to spread vector-borne diseases, especially as international travel moves them quickly across borders. Aedes mosquitoes can also carry dengue, Zika, and yellow fever — all illnesses that have reached record or near-record case counts in multiple regions over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While China doesn't have access to the two chikungunya vaccines that have been approved in the United States, its government has said it's employing preventative measures such as quarantining, spraying mosquito repellent with drones, and releasing fish into ponds to eat mosquito larvae, according to the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC's Level 2 advisory has been extended to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine countries&lt;/a&gt; with chikungunya outbreaks. Some ways people can protect themselves include wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in places with screened or air-conditioned rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is a reminder that protecting public health will increasingly require quick outbreak responses as the planet continues to warm. In the long run, curbing heat-trapping pollution is the most important part of preventing these diseases from spreading more easily.
