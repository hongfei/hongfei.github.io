Although the couple had been talking about adopting a second fur baby, Jayme surprised her husband by bringing home the most adorable English Cream Golden Retriever puppy after fate brought the pup straight to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jayme's excitement to bring the puppy home could make anyone smile, but it's her husband's reaction that has everyone reaching for the tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aww!

Once the shock wore off, he scooped up that puppy as if he'd been waiting for him all his life.

          &lt;p&gt;A measles investigation amid a large, ongoing outbreak at the Arizona-Utah border has hit a roadblock as the first probable case identified in the Salt Lake City area refuses to work with health officials, the local health department reported this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been over 150 cases collectively across the two states, mostly in northwestern Mohave County, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and the southwest health district of &lt;a href="https://avrpublic.dhhs.utah.gov/uwss/"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, in the past two months. Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only &lt;a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats"&gt;78.4 percent of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html"&gt;only 80.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including &lt;a href="https://health.utahcounty.gov/2025/10/31/new-measles-case-in-utah-county/"&gt;a new case reported today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncooperative case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County likely has a new one, too—the first for the county this year—as well as possible exposures. But, they can’t confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County health officials said that a health care provider in the area contacted them late on Monday to tell them about a patient who very likely has measles. The officials then spent a day reaching out to the person, who refused to answer questions or cooperate in any way. That included refusing to share location information so that other people could be notified that they were potentially exposed to one of the most infectious viruses known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” Dorothy Adams, executive director of Salt Lake County Health Department, said in &lt;a href="https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/health/news/probable-first-case-of-measles-in-salt-lake-county/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County.”&lt;/p&gt;

Or notice that your mouth constantly feels like it’s filled with cotton balls? You might have dry mouth (a.k.a. xerostomia), an oral health condition that causes reduced saliva flow, leading to symptoms like a burning sensation, rapid tooth decay, uncontrolled cavities, bad breath, altered taste and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350fe0" class="body-graf"&gt;Dry mouth is quite common — it affects about one in five people, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10902-dry-mouth-xerostomia" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s under-diagnosed because often, people who experience it mistakenly think they’re dehydrated, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaddahi.com/about/meet-dr-maddahi/" target="_blank"&gt;Kourosh Maddahi&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist at Dion Health in California and the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://lumineuxhealth.com" target="_blank"&gt;Lumineux&lt;/a&gt;. And the longer you go without treating dry mouth, the more long-term damage it can do to your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd155a" class="body-graf"&gt;To help you determine if you have dry mouth, and figure out how to alleviate symptoms, I talked to dentists about everything you need to know. I also rounded up the best over-the-counter dry mouth treatments, one of which you might have in your bag right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42080a" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more from NBC Select? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/nbc-news-select-signup-pd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-73c3ac" id="anchor-73c3ac" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What is dry mouth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52acbc" class="body-graf"&gt;Dry mouth is a condition that makes your mouth feel dry due to inadequate saliva flow, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://dentistry.osu.edu/faculty/matthew-j-messina-dds" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Messina&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at The Ohio State University College of Dentistry and the clinic director of Ohio State’s Upper Arlington Dentistry. It can be caused by medications, mouth breathing, radiation treatment and tobacco and cannabis use, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-29a8e3" class="body-graf"&gt;To fully understand why dry mouth can be so damaging to your oral health, it’s important to understand the important roles saliva plays in the mouth. As a natural antibiotic, it’s the mouth’s first line of defense against cavity-causing bacteria, and it also acts as a lubricant to prevent abrasion, and cleans plaque and other particles off teeth, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/pres/governance/lloyd-bio.php" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine. Saliva also remineralizes tooth enamel (teeth’s hard outer layer) since it has calcium and phosphate, which make teeth more resistant to decay. Another crucial function of saliva is to neutralize acids, says Lloyd. When the bacteria in your mouth break down sugars, they produce acids that can weaken enamel. Saliva neutralizes these acids to prevent them from damaging your teeth, and helps your mouth maintain a balanced pH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35621e" class="body-graf"&gt;All that said, if dry mouth isn’t managed and you constantly don’t have enough saliva in your mouth, it can lead to rampant cavities, bad breath, difficulty swallowing, mouth sores, poor taste and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-b580ba" id="anchor-b580ba" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How do you treat dry mouth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99e92c" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re concerned about dry mouth, first see your dentist. They’ll examine your mouth, looking for the appropriate amount and consistency of saliva, as well as signs of decay, says Messina. Then, they’ll help you develop a treatment plan, which often consists of using over-the-counter products to alleviate symptoms, like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-mouthwashes-rcna190988" target="_blank"&gt;mouthwashes&lt;/a&gt;, gels, chewing gums and lozenges. While these products temporarily relieve symptoms associated with dry mouth, they have limitations. They don’t address the underlying cause of the condition, completely prevent issues like tooth decay, and also not long-term solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4151cc" class="body-graf"&gt;Treating dry mouth also involves making lifestyle changes, like cutting back on certain food and drinks (more on that in the FAQs section below). If you have severe dry mouth that will likely cause recurring dental issues, your dentist may prescribe a concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/fluoride-free-toothpaste-rcna189650" target="_blank"&gt;fluoride&lt;/a&gt; gel or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-toothpastes-ncna1294664" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, which helps make teeth more resistant to decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-be7886" id="anchor-be7886" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How I picked the best dry mouth treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f4fb5" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what dentists recommend I consider while shopping for dry mouth treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-9f7f77" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva substitute v.s. stimulant: &lt;/strong&gt;Saliva&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;substitutes act as a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/100-best-face-moisturizers-rcna151958" target="_blank"&gt;moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; for your mouth, alleviating the dry, sticky, burning sensation that’s typically associated with the condition. They’re not as effective as natural human saliva, but they work well enough, dentists told me. Saliva stimulants, on the other hand, activate the taste buds, sending a signal to the brain that it needs to tell the salivary glands to make more saliva, says Lloyd. Many treatments are both saliva substitutes and stimulants, while some are one or the other — I have all types on this list. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Dry mouth treatments are available as mouthwashes, sprays, dissolvable tablets, gels, chewing gums and more. One is not better than the other — it’s entirely a matter of personal preference, so try a few and see what works for you. Some treatments also lend themselves better to at-home use versus on the go use, and vice versa. I recommend various treatment types below so you can compare them and decide which you might like best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid products made with alcohol and sugar if you have dry mouth as they can worsen the condition. For example, choose alcohol-free mouthwashes and sugar-free gum and lozenges. Over-the-counter dry mouth treatments are commonly made with xylitol, a sugar substitute that the mouth bacteria doesn’t feed on, so it doesn’t cause cavities while stimulating saliva production, says Messina. All the products on this list are sugar-free and alcohol-free, and many are made with xylitol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADA Seal of Acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;: Dental products that earn the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science/ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance&lt;/a&gt; are independently evaluated by the organization to ensure they’re safe and effective, says Messina. That doesn’t mean products without the Seal aren’t worth using — it just means brands haven’t voluntarily submitted them to be reviewed. I prioritized ADA-accepted products while recommending the dry mouth treatments below, but the options are limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-547b98" id="anchor-547b98" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;The best dry mouth treatments of 2025&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d52a6" class="body-graf"&gt;Below, I rounded up dry mouth treatments that are available over the counter that meet dentists’ guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-3bb9b4" id="anchor-3bb9b4" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best mouthwash&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-62f3a0"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63417" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-bioténe-dry-mouth-oral-rinse" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-bioténe-dry-mouth-oral-rinse"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relieves symptoms for ∾4 hrs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freshens breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-084ec7" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of drinking water when your mouth feels dry, use a hydrating mouthrinse, says Maddahi. Bioténe’s, which earned the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance, stops dry mouth symptoms for up to four hours by soothing, lubricating and moisturizing. It also can help stimulate saliva production since it’s made with xylitol. The mouthwash’s minty flavor freshens breath, and it helps your mouth maintain a balanced pH, too — the mouth’s pH becomes more acidic due to a lack of saliva, which neutralizes acids, according to the dentists I talked to. The brand recommends swishing it around in your mouth for about 30 seconds before spitting it out, and says you can use it up to five times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-38f594" id="anchor-38f594" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best dissolvable tablets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-86086f"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63422" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-oracoat-xylimelts-for-dry-mouth" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-oracoat-xylimelts-for-dry-mouth"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relieves symptoms for ∾8 hrs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use overnight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neutralizes acids in mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application may take practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6a5f2" class="body-graf"&gt;These dissolvable tablets can relieve dry mouth symptoms for up to eight hours, according to the brand. You place a tablet on one or both sides of the mouth outside of a molar, putting the tan side against your gum and the white side against your teeth. Move it into a comfortable spot with your tongue, and then don’t touch it — it will start to adhere to your gums so it stays in place. The tablet slowly releases xylitol to lubricate the mouth and stimulate saliva production throughout the day, or you can apply it for overnight relief. XyliMelts are also made with calcium carbonate, an ingredient that helps prevent plaque and tooth decay, according to the brand. They can neutralize acids, too, preventing tooth damage like weakened enamel. The tablets come in three flavors: cinnamon, mild mint and slightly sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-55d3a2" id="anchor-55d3a2" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best lozenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-013cf3"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63423" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-act-dry-mouth-lozenges" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-act-dry-mouth-lozenges"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes in 2 flavors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freshens breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note at this time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ff6b2" class="body-graf"&gt;If the tablets above sound like a hassle to apply, or you don’t love the idea of them staying in your mouth for hours, lozenges for dry mouth are another option you can try.

CariFree’s Oral Spray comes highly recommended by NBC Select editorial operations associate &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/jem-alabi-ncpn1312495" target="_blank"&gt;Jem Alabi&lt;/a&gt;. She gets “a very serious case of dry mouth” from certain foods and drinks, and says this spray is her go-to solution. “It freshens my breath in a way that lasts for hours, and I love that it comes in a pack of four so I can keep one at work, home and in my travel backpack,” says Alabi. “The mint flavor is mild and doesn’t sting like some others can, but it also comes in a grape flavor if you want to switch it up.” The spray’s gentle formula, which contains xylitol, helps neutralize acids in your mouth to balance its pH as well, and it’s safe if you swallow it, according to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-3fba4c" id="anchor-3fba4c" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best gum&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-ed4bd4"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63426" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-orbit-sugar-free-gum" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-orbit-sugar-free-gum"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes in 5 flavors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multipacks available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note at this time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f850cf" class="body-graf"&gt;Chewing naturally causes saliva production, so you can use sugar-free gum as a saliva stimulant, says Lloyd. There’s options specifically made for dry mouth (like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACT-Mouth-Moisturizing-Xylitol-Count/dp/B079119TPM?tag=drymouthtreatmentrcna241165-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-commerce-encoding="true" data-seller-id="ncrg916911"&gt;this one from Act&lt;/a&gt;), but any sugar-free option will do. “You don’t have to look for a really expensive way to manage dry mouth,” says Lloyd. “Whatever you can do to hyper-stimulate your salivary gland and tastebuds to produce saliva in healthy situations is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dc715e" class="body-graf"&gt;Orbit’s ADA-accepted, sugar-free gum is my all-time favorite option.

Some toothpastes are specifically formulated for those with dry mouth, including this one from Bioténe. It won’t irritate your mouth or worsen symptoms, according to the brand, and it has a mild minty flavor to help freshen breath. The toothpaste’s fluoride fights cavities, remineralizes tooth enamel to strengthen it, making it more resistant to decay, and reduces bacteria in the mouth, plus it’s free from sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a detergent that makes toothpaste foamy, yet some people are sensitive to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-bee018" id="anchor-bee018" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best electric toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-56f295"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63428" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-oral-b-pro-1000-electric-toothbrush" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-oral-b-pro-1000-electric-toothbrush"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built-in timer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small round brush head&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;No change brush head indicator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54f6d5" class="body-graf"&gt;Consider getting an oscillating &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-electric-toothbrushes-ncna1193846" target="_blank"&gt;electric toothbrush&lt;/a&gt; if you have dry mouth, which cleans teeth more deeply than a manual toothbrush, says Lloyd. It removes built-up grime that the little saliva in your mouth couldn’t wash away, and dislodges gunk between teeth. “The oscillating bristle tips not only remove debris that they come in contact with, but their vibrating effects move beyond the bristles and can cause things to be removed from teeth two or three millimeters away from their ends,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92b639" class="body-graf"&gt;Oral-B’s Pro 1000 Electric Toothbrush has all the features dentists recommend looking for in a quality toothbrush: the ADA Seal of Acceptance, a two-minute timer, a pressure sensor and a small round head to reach all of your mouth’s nooks and crannies. The brush head is also easily replaceable — dentists recommend swapping it out every three months and after you’re sick. Oral-B’s electric toothbrush lets you choose between three cleaning modes, and it comes with a charger stand. The battery lasts for about 10 days when fully charged, according to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed" data-testid="article-faq-embed" id="anchor-ccc958"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed__content"&gt;&lt;h2 class="faq-embed__headline"&gt;&lt;span class="text"&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed__cards" data-testid="faq-embed__cards"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the most common causes of dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the causes below are lifelong, unavoidable conditions that lead to chronic dry mouth, says Lloyd. Other causes are temporary, and once addressed, people may be “cured” of dry mouth or experience it less severely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking certain medications&lt;/strong&gt;: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that causes salivation, says Maddahi. Certain medications can impact that neurotransmitter by blocking it, which leads to decreased saliva production and, in turn, dry mouth. On other hand, some medications decrease fluid in the circulatory system, leading to dehydration and related saliva production. Examples of medications that usually cause dry mouth include those for anxiety, depression, pain, blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, urinary incontinence, allergies and weight loss. If you visit a company’s website, you can often read its medications’ labels and check which have “xerostomia” or “dry mouth” listed as a side effect. Messina says that those who take multiple medications are at higher risk for experiencing dry mouth compared to those who take only one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouth breathing&lt;/strong&gt;: People often struggle to breathe through their nose if they have seasonal allergies and/or a deviated septum, says Maddahi. In these cases, people breathe through their mouth by keeping it open more than usual, which can dry it out, reduce saliva and cause gum inflammation around the top and bottom front teeth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis, tobacco, vape and alcohol use&lt;/strong&gt;: All four can dry out the mouth, as well as cause dehydration. Smoking tobacco also often damages the salivary glands, which produce saliva, and irritates the mouth’s mucous membranes. Maddahi says any form of cannabis can lead to dry mouth, including gummies and other edibles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer treatments&lt;/strong&gt;: Chemotherapy usually leads to a temporary reduction in salivary gland function, so they produce less saliva during treatment, but regulate as damaged tissue heals, says Messina. If you’re treated for head and/or neck cancer with targeted radiation therapy, the salivary glands are usually permanently impacted and will no longer be able to function properly, says Lloyd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diseases and other medical conditions&lt;/strong&gt;: Those with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes and Sjögren disease have a higher rate of dry mouth, says Lloyd. Dry mouth is also associated with other diseases, like Covid-19, cystic fibrosis and HIV/AIDS, as well as medical conditions like stroke and uncontrolled hypertension, says Messina. It’s related to hormonal changes, like during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-pregnancy-safe-skin-care-rcna100065" target="_blank"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms of dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s numerous symptoms of dry mouth, but asking his patients one question often lets Maddahi make a quick diagnosis: Do you sleep with water next to your bed? People who have dry mouth tend to wake up in the middle of the night to drink water because they’re desperate to get rid of the sticky, burning, tingling feeling associated with it. They also usually guzzle a glass of water first thing in the morning, and constantly carry around a water bottle to sip from throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rampant cavities and sudden tooth delay are other common symptoms of dry mouth that dentists worry about. If you don’t produce enough saliva, the number of cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth exponentially increases. And it doesn’t just cause one or two new cavities — Lloyd says he’s seen patients with up to 30 cavities that seemingly pop up out of nowhere, and with no prior history of oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms of dry mouth include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble swallowing and chewing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labored speech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altered taste, causing food and drinks to be bland and flavorless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intolerance for spicy, salty, or sour food and drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth injuries like cuts and sores, which often take a while to heal &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad breath (halitosis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry, sore throat and hoarseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry, rough tongue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cracked, peeling, atrophic and/or sticky lips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral fungal infection (candidiasis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent ulcers underneath dentures and artificial teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problems keeping dentures and artificial teeth in place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you avoid if you have dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those with dry mouth produce such little saliva, it’s important to avoid anything that can exacerbate the condition, make you more uncomfortable and increase your chance of tooth decay. To ensure that the small amount of saliva available can work as efficiently as possible, dentists recommend avoiding the below if you have dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol-based mouthwashes: &lt;/strong&gt;Most mouthwashes are made with alcohol, which acts as a disinfectant and kills bacteria that can lead to bad breath, gum disease and cavities. But it also has a drying effect, so those with dry mouth should stick to alcohol-free formulas, says Lloyd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessively drinking water&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a natural instinct to drink water when your mouth feels dry, but in excess, water makes the condition worse. “Water doesn’t do anything to help your mouth, but saliva does,” says Maddahi. “By constantly drinking water, you’re diluting the very little saliva you have and reducing its effectiveness even further.” Instead, reach for a saliva stimulating product like a mouthrinse, spray or tablet, and save water strictly for hydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and drinks high in sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Saliva neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria feeding on sugar in your mouth, and washes sugar off your teeth so it doesn’t sit on enamel. If you don’t produce enough saliva to perform either of these functions effectively, you’re at high risk for tooth decay, so cut back on sugary foods and drinks, including sucking candies and soda, dentists say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy food&lt;/strong&gt;: They all have drying effects on the mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often should you go to the dentist if you have dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="131bfb"&gt;If you have dry mouth, you’re more likely to get cavities and have other oral health issues. To catch problems early if they arise, Maddahi says those with dry mouth should go to the dentist every three months rather than every six months, which is the standard recommendation from the ADA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does aging cause dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="6604a9"&gt;Older adults are more likely to experience dry mouth, says Messina. In fact, it affects an estimated 30% of people older than 65 and up to 40% of people older than 80, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank"&gt;ADA&lt;/a&gt;. Dry mouth isn’t a direct consequence of aging, however, since adults only produce moderately less saliva compared to younger adults, says Lloyd. The biggest contributing factor to dry mouth prevalence among this population is medication usage. Many older adults take medications, often multiple at a time, to control conditions like hypertension, urinary incontinence and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-ddd112" id="anchor-ddd112" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Meet our experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c216b3" class="body-graf"&gt;At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Yet alongside their proven benefits, awareness is growing of a lesser-known, often silenced side effect: sexual dysfunction that may persist long after patients stop taking the medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="7782n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7782n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7782n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“I was on Cipralex for two and a half months,” wrote one man in an online support group. “While on it, I had almost no libido, trouble maintaining an erection, and less physical pleasure — even kisses felt dull. Months after stopping, some of that feeling returned, but not all of it. I later found out that for some people, the effects never go away.

The lingering condition has a name: PSSD, or Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction. It describes sexual side effects that continue even after stopping the drug, including loss of libido, decreased pleasure, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, and numbness in the genitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;A recent study in Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences found that in some patients, sexual function does not return to baseline even months or years after discontinuation — raising uncomfortable questions within psychiatry. Experts are divided: is this real, or the result of psychological factors?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Dr. Oren Tene, head of the psychiatric department at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital and director of the Mentalix Center for Mental Health, sexual side effects during SSRI use are well documented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“It’s a known phenomenon,” he says. “It’s almost a cruel trade-off — when serotonin levels rise and mood improves, sexual function often declines. Nearly all SSRIs do this, some more than others. It’s a class-wide effect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="714p7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="714p7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="714p7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The symptoms, he explains, vary. “We commonly see reduced libido and delayed orgasm. Men may experience erectile issues, and women may experience decreased lubrication. Ironically, this particular side effect is sometimes used therapeutically — SSRIs are prescribed to men with premature ejaculation. But when the delay is excessive, it becomes frustrating for both partners.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Tene adds that anxiety and depression themselves can suppress sexual function: “I tell patients that depression and good sex don’t go hand in hand. Sometimes the net effect of treatment is still positive.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While side effects during treatment are well established, what happens after stopping the medication remains contentious. “That’s where it gets controversial,” says Dr. Tene. “Does sexual dysfunction sometimes persist afterward? Literature increasingly suggests yes. It’s hard to study, but it seems to happen to a subset of patients, though we don’t know how many.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="fa8lo-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Science has yet to pinpoint a cause. “Physiologically, there’s no clear explanation,” he says. “When the drug is in the system, we know serotonin interacts with dopamine and norepinephrine. But after discontinuation, theoretically, there’s no reason for ongoing symptoms. We just don’t know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Underreporting is also likely, he adds. “Patients don’t always connect the dots. The most common complaints are reduced sensation, less pleasure, erectile issues, or delayed ejaculation. Many describe feeling ‘numb.’ Men seem to report it more, but women often describe more severe symptoms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Even within the medical community, there’s disagreement. “Some doctors argue patients misremember that their sexual function didn’t change much from before. The topic is difficult to study, and documenting every possible side effect is impossible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Tene stresses caution: “These are life-saving medications. Listing every rare or disputed side effect could scare patients away from treatment. On the other hand, patients deserve informed consent. It’s a delicate balance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What can be done when symptoms persist? “Unfortunately, we don’t have a specific treatment,” says Dr. Tene. “For most, it resolves — sometimes after weeks or months, occasionally longer. But there’s no guaranteed fix.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="38fld-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="38fld-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="38fld-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yifat Mekler, a sexologist and couples therapist at Rambam Health Care Campus, agrees that the condition is real but often temporary. “In most cases, symptoms fade within weeks to two months. Stopping antidepressants abruptly can prolong recovery — it shocks the nervous system and delays adjustment,” she explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4c7gi-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Even when the body recovers, the mind can keep the problem alive. “The physical and psychological aspects are intertwined,” Mekler says. “Men often develop performance anxiety — they focus on what might go wrong instead of being present in the moment. That stress raises cortisol and adrenaline, which suppresses the parasympathetic response needed for arousal. It becomes a vicious cycle.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Therapeutic support, she adds, is crucial. “Sex therapy helps men shift focus away from performance and back to sensuality and connection. Couples can explore intimacy that isn’t centered on intercourse.

Tiny doses of it killed strains of bacteria known to cause hard-to-treat infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02601-4" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_27689634.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Five ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was a ‘surprise’, says study co-author Gregory Challis, a chemical biologist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK. “As humans, we anticipate that evolution perfects the end product, and so you’d expect the final molecule to be the best antibiotic, and the intermediates to be less potent,” he says. But the finding “is a great example of what a ‘blind watchmaker’ evolution is. And it’s a good way of exemplifying it in a very molecular way,” adds Challis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; is a growing threat, projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. Researchers say that the discovery of a potent antimicrobial compound might lead to fresh drugs to tackle resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work underscores “the potential of such studies to identify new bioactive chemical scaffolds from ‘old’ pathways”, says Gerard Wright, a biochemist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accidental discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Challis and his colleagues began studying the molecular pathway through which &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; produces methylenomycin A. To do this, they deleted the genes encoding enzymes involved in each step, one by one. Their work built on earlier efforts in 2002 to sequence the bacterium’s genome&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_50915536.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;New antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria discovered in technician’s garden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2010, the team had mapped the mechanism that the bacterium used to make methylenomycin A and identified several intermediate molecules that it produced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were just doing very fundamental blue-sky research,” says Challis. “We discovered these intermediates, and we left them for a while because we didn’t quite know what to do with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was several years later — around 2017 — that a PhD student at Challis’s laboratory tested these intermediate molecules for antimicrobial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests revealed that two molecules, including premethylenomycin C lactone, were much more effective than methylenomycin A at targeting seven strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, which infects skin, blood and internal organs, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt;, which can cause deadly bloodstream and urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest concentration of premethylenomycin C lactone needed to kill drug-resistant strains of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; was just 1 microgram per millilitre, compared with 256 micrograms per millilitre of methylenomycin A. The compound could also kill bacteria at much smaller doses than those needed for vancomycin, a ‘last line’ antibiotic used to treat infections caused by two &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt; strains, to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — Numerous dead waterfowl and raptors across Missouri have confirmed a &lt;a href="/article/news/health/missouri-first-bird-flu-case-sparks-global-concern-one-year-later-trump-cdc-pandemic-preparedness/63-14bcb3c9-1152-4e8c-aee7-5ba934c076ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;bird flu outbreak&lt;/a&gt; across the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missouri Department of Conservation on Friday confirmed the outbreak, saying the bodies of 11 dead birds have tested positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. Three other suspected cases are currently being investigated, according to Conservation Health Section Chief Deb Hudman.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Louis County has recorded the highest number of confirmed and suspected infections at seven, followed by Dunklin County at four, and St. Charles, Shelby, and Crawford counties with one each. &lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/wildlife-diseases/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here for a full list of confirmed and suspected infections.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads among birds through contact with infected feces, saliva, or nasal discharges. Bird flu cases also tend to spike in the fall months, when migratory birds travel along the nation's flyways and risk spreading the virus to domestic birds and livestock.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri marked its first anniversary since its&lt;a href="/article/news/health/missouri-first-bird-flu-case-sparks-global-concern-one-year-later-trump-cdc-pandemic-preparedness/63-14bcb3c9-1152-4e8c-aee7-5ba934c076ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; first human case of bird flu in September&lt;/a&gt;. The risk of spread of bird flu to the general public remains low, but officials still urge caution since human infections have occurred after close exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HPAI infections in humans are rare," the department said in a press release. "Contact a healthcare provider if experiencing any unusual symptoms of possible infection, such as eye redness, respiratory problems, and fever. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 165°F helps destroy the virus if present."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservationists asked hunters and state residents to help stop the spread of the virus. Hunters were encouraged to dress harvested game birds away from other birds, dispose of carcasses and waste properly, and allow hunting gear to dry completely between trips. Residents were asked to avoid dead birds, keep pets away from dead or dying wildlife, and&lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/http:%252F%252Fshort.mdc.mo.gov%252F4KD/1/01000193b0de15f8-56b8e041-c739-4e08-bbe3-319a8a98e42a-000000/4zq51NG74I5e2pNUWHGHpPmQfzcQgWLMwqsWbgPzz1o=383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; report any sightings of dead geese, raptors, or other large birds to MDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="afc2c2a6-a8cc-493c-9f50-5190f54f823c"&gt;On Dec. 31, 2019, the first reports emerged about a mysterious pneumonia of unknown cause circulating in China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 16, the first COVID-19 vaccine entered clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="afc2c2a6-a8cc-493c-9f50-5190f54f823c-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;And by Dec. 14, members of the American public were getting the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines outside of trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5d0d2728-7b20-496e-988f-b0e2cff2fc6a"&gt;The first coronavirus vaccines were paradigm-shifting because they went from conceptualization to mass production in mere months. But they were also unique because they used a new way to stimulate the immune system — one that had been thoroughly studied for decades in order to be ready for deployment at this crucial moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to these vaccines was messenger RNA (mRNA), DNA's less-famous cousin. The power of the mRNA platform is that vaccines can be produced exceptionally quickly once a pathogen's genetics have been analyzed; conventional vaccine manufacturing takes months or years whereas mRNA vaccines can be made in mere weeks. So while it was once the subject of high school biology classes and niche pockets of biomedical science, mRNA was suddenly thrust into the public eye — and once there, it inspired relentless misinformation and controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are the best known application of the molecule, researchers around the world have found additional uses for mRNA technology beyond the realm of vaccines. They're exploring its use for groundbreaking treatments for cancer and autoimmune disease, as well as for gene-editing therapies for genetic disorders. But that promise may be unrealized in the United States, where the federal government has declared war against this promising technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new stance runs counter to the Trump administration's prior embrace of mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UcxdGRtEU48juVgNsVDxYV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UcxdGRtEU48juVgNsVDxYV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/science-spotlight" id="95381192-f180-4a10-83df-2af5bbc2f677" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/science-spotlight"&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Science Spotlight takes a deeper look at emerging science and gives you, our readers, the perspective you need on these advances.

These ubiquitous "messengers" copy instructions from DNA and relay them to other locations in the cell — namely, to protein-construction sites where the complex molecules that do most of the work in cells get made. mRNA also performs other key jobs in cells, such as helping control which genes are switched on and to what degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades prior to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated scientists pored over mRNA, learning how this class of molecules works in the body and how it might be leveraged to heal the sick and guard against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started doing this when I was like 21, back in the '90s, back when about 10 people on Earth knew what mRNA were," Coller said.

These include, for example, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — and certain molecules on cancer cells.

The team hoped to re-create that immune recognition in other patients by analyzing the genetics of their tumors to see what unique antigens they express. They then create customized vaccines that target those molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We felt at the time [when we started this work] — this is back in 2017 — that the best technology for rapid custom cancer vaccination for patients was to use RNA," Balachandran said. Once you know a given patient's cancer genetics, a personalized mRNA vaccine that targets multiple antigens can be crafted in a matter of weeks. Conventional vaccines that require the antigens to be grown in the lab and purified would take many months to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For cancer vaccination, speed is essential," Balachandran said. "These are patients who are facing deadly cancers, who require rapid treatment. So we do not have the luxury of waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9ecaeac2-f738-458f-952d-05e7374abe83"&gt;So far, the team has seen some success.

Half of the patients responded to their vaccine, producing immune cells that have persisted for nearly four years so far, and estimates suggest they could last an average of seven years, "with some lasting even beyond a decade," Balachandran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine responders had a significantly lower risk of recurrence in the following three years than those who didn't respond, with six showing no signs of recurrence in that time frame. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/clinical-trials/23-136" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/clinical-trials/23-136" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mid-stage trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now testing the vaccine in about 260 people to see how well it delays or prevents recurrence compared with standard treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything we can do to improve outcomes for these patients who really need help I think will be transformative for the field, for them, for their families — it will mean a lot," Balachandran said. "All other immune therapies and all other therapies have largely failed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this initial trial, vaccine production took over two months, in part because samples had to be shipped to overseas collaborators at BioNTech. "We are confident this can happen much faster" in the future, perhaps within a month, Balachandran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists are working on off-the-shelf cancer vaccines that can help bridge the gap until a patient gets a personalized one. These vaccines use a mix of mRNA molecules to stir up a generic, first-line immune defense against cancer. In mice with different kinds of solid tumors, researchers led by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/elias-sayour" target="_blank" data-url="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/elias-sayour" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Elias Sayour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric oncologist at the University of Florida, demonstrated that such a vaccine &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/universal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/universal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triggers anti-cancer responses by itself&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And when used in combination with another cancer treatment, the mRNA mix can boost the effects of that therapy, Sayour's team has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure extended-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="fffe3107-52f4-42dc-9139-0aa093571f2a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" extended-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A researcher working on a lung cancer vaccine in the Ose Immunotherapeutics laboratory in Nantes, France. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: LOIC VENANCE via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="f7816f2c-104e-4b96-a5dc-95bc2c048719"&gt;That team has now moved on to human patients, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with a two-pronged approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine, followed by a personalized one.

But pancreatic cancer can be targeted with these vaccines. That bodes well for using mRNA approaches to treat potentially many other cancers, and "I think that's really the most exciting take-home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cancer vaccines, Green and colleagues are leveraging mRNA to fight the disease in a different way: by forcing tumors to raise their own red flags to the immune system. Using &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014296122300193X" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014296122300193X" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mRNA packaged inside nanoparticles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers introduce immune-cell genes into cancer cells, prompting tumors to expose their antigens and secrete molecules that call immune cells to the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can program that tumor cell to now act like an immune cell that helps teach other immune cells what its antigens look like, how to recognize it, how to destroy it," Green told Live Science. In mouse models of breast cancer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(23)01370-2/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(23)01370-2/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;and melanoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they combined this approach with an existing immunotherapy and found that it helped shrink and clear tumors from the body while also extending survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If shown to work in people, "this could just be off the shelf," he said. It would be one injectable that could work on any patient's solid tumor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7d18f44d-0d28-4163-8f01-61dc40bba4a3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="immune-reprogramming-3"&gt;Immune reprogramming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="38f86836-613d-467e-97d5-a5f3ece1cc21"&gt;In cancer, scientists are exploring different ways to launch an immune attack against tumor cells, whether by igniting a generalized response or enabling cells to spot specific red flags. But in some diseases, the immune system itself is the culprit — and in those instances, mRNA can help rein in turncoat immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Autoimmune diseases — type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's, colitis — these can be treated with these mRNA and genetic-based therapies," potentially, Green said. The goal of these treatments would be to "tune the immune system" so it stops attacking healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In type 1 diabetes, for example, the immune system attacks beta cells, which make insulin, leaving the body too little of the hormone to control blood sugar. Green and colleagues are in the early stages of developing an mRNA medicine to reprogram the immune system so it better tolerates beta cells, rather than attacking them. They aim to do this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10835326" target="_blank" data-url="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10835326" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;by targeting special immune cells in the liver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that promote a tolerant environment in the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is constantly exposed to antigens from food and from microbes in the gut, so immune activity is dialed down to prevent an overreaction. The team's idea is to deliver mRNA that codes for beta-cell proteins to the liver, essentially marking those beta-cell proteins as "safe" to the immune system. This, in turn, can increase the number of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-trio-for-their-work-on-immune-tolerance" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-trio-for-their-work-on-immune-tolerance"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regulatory T cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that recognize the proteins as safe; regulatory T cells keep other immune cells in check, and could thus help ward off further attacks on beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with autoimmunity is that [the immune system] thinks parts of its own body are foreign," so it's trying to attack them, Green explained. The hope is that "we can use these mRNA medicines to train the immune system so that it sees, 'Oh no, this is fine.'" The work is currently in preclinical stages, as the team runs experiments with cells and lab mice to refine their mRNA nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green calls this approach of fine-tuning specific cells' activity "genetic surgery." Rather than using a "blunter instrument," like immunosuppressive drugs, to broadly suppress the immune system, the surgery makes a precise change to counter only harmful immune activity. In the long run, the lab is looking to apply this same approach to other autoimmune diseases beyond diabetes, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8693" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add8693" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which immune cells target myelin, the insulation surrounding nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BioNTech &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3638" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3638" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has published data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from its own early tests of an mRNA vaccine designed to quell autoimmunity against myelin. In mice, the vaccine expanded populations of immune cells that then kept the myelin-attacking cells in check, suppressing their activity without hobbling the immune system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, researchers including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kianilab.com/people.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kianilab.com/people.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Samira Kiani&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholars.cmu.edu/2621-kathryn-whitehead/publications" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholars.cmu.edu/2621-kathryn-whitehead/publications" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kathryn Whitehead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Carnegie Mellon University are using mRNA to counter off-the-rails immune responses, such as the extreme inflammation seen in sepsis. Their approach, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639996v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639996v1.full.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;described in a preprint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, packages mRNA inside a tiny bubble of fat called a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which then ferries the mRNA into immune cells. From there, the mRNA instructs the cells to make proteins called "zinc finger repressors," which latch onto genes and suppress their activity. In this case, they repressed a key &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4615" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4615" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gene involved in the immune signaling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to runaway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments with cells in lab dishes and with mice, this type of "epigenetic engineering" showed promise as a potential method for tuning the activity of the immune system. One perk of mRNA is that it degrades quickly in the body, the study authors wrote, so in theory, once the harmful inflammation is subdued, the immune system can get back to defending the body against germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ba6bdffe-2241-4078-bc22-b74c4c6583b7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="gene-editing-3"&gt;Gene editing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="05cce102-276a-43d8-9af3-368890b6b184"&gt;mRNA is also being used in tandem with the gene-editing system &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to revolutionize treatments for genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classical CRISPR systems use molecular scissors to snip through DNA strands and enable scientists to tweak specific segments of the molecule.

The condition arises from mutations in the CPS1 gene, but in different patients, the gene is broken in different ways. To fix KJ's specific mutation, scientists developed a customized gene therapy consisting of a guide and an mRNA that carried instructions for a base editor into his liver cells, where CPS1 is most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The editor is so large that it cannot easily be accommodated by an AAV vector," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cvi/musunuru-laboratory.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cvi/musunuru-laboratory.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Kiran Musunuru&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-developer of the therapy and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.

By 9 months old, he had received several doses of the therapy and was thriving; he was hitting milestones he may have never reached otherwise, his medical team reported in May.

Kennedy Jr., HHS has withdrawn support from mRNA vaccine research. The future of other uses of the technology is uncertain, which has prompted stakeholders to reconsider their R&amp;amp;D strategies in the U.S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="20fea12c-e0a3-4fd5-addc-1b4937e5ed87"&gt;For now, other applications of mRNA don't appear to be a focus for funding cuts, although some projects have nonetheless been caught in the crosshairs of reduced federal spending. For his part, Musunuru told Live Science he's been in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration regarding ways to get more patients access to personalized gene therapies like KJ's, so that the technology isn't used only in a handful of special cases. When asked about potential funding cuts, he added, "Vaccines and therapies are so different that I do not expect the latter to be affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green, however, anticipates that divestments from vaccines would have unanticipated impacts across the field, because mRNA therapies and vaccines are ultimately composed of very similar genetic molecules and delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding nanoparticles, "the vaccine development is … at the pioneering edge of this technology platform," Green said. He argues that cuts to vaccine R&amp;amp;D will inevitably undermine the development of nanoparticles that could be really useful in treating cancer or genetic disease. "It's going to set us back in a very broad way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hits to vaccine research also aren't happening in isolation. Myriad federal science grants have been terminated or frozen; NIH agencies &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/house-republicans-add-support-maintaining-nih-budget-2026" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/content/article/house-republicans-add-support-maintaining-nih-budget-2026" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may be facing steep funding cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and the government shutdown ushered mass layoffs across leading health institutions. Sayour, the oncologist whose lab is developing personalized and universal cancer vaccines using mRNA, said federal grants have historically been critical to his research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of this would be possible without the support of the federal government," Sayour told Live Science. "That is most certainly, 100% true." And that goes for every stage of research, from studies in lab dishes to large clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These widespread cuts and more-targeted cuts to mRNA vaccines will not only starve the academic environments where new biotechnologies are typically nurtured, Coller said; they will also drive prospective talent, investors and industry stakeholders in the mRNA space away from the U.S. "In biotech, we're going to see, over the next five to 10 years, a significant 'brain drain,' where other countries build up their infrastructure," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coller knows this because he is a founding member of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mrnamedicines.org/about/" target="_blank" data-url="https://mrnamedicines.org/about/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alliance for mRNA Medicines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AMM), a global organization aimed at advancing and advocating for mRNA medicines.

They primarily represented U.S.-headquartered pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations but also included some based in Europe, Canada or Asia. Even prior to the major HHS cuts in August, these stakeholders were feeling squeezed; nearly half reported "already experiencing direct impacts" from federal policy changes tied to mRNA funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a2056a2e-5c98-4661-8ed0-60b22045f2f3"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's not fool ourselves: mRNA is one of the three most important molecules in the body, with the other two being DNA and protein.

About 30% of respondents said that, if faced with further cuts, they might pivot away from mRNA, and 30% said they'd consider moving their operations to other countries. Over 80% agreed that anti-mRNA policies would drive talent away from the U.S. and toward other locales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as scientists contend with these big-picture problems on the national and international stage, skirmishes have also been unfolding at the state level.

Another bill in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=4262&amp;amp;session126&amp;amp;summary=B" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=4262&amp;amp;session126&amp;amp;summary=B" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;committee in South Carolina&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would prohibit the use of mRNA-based "gene therapies" in the state, but makes an exception for therapies for noninfectious diseases, such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6e502651-12be-4847-870b-1ad5097f85ce"&gt;It may be that most bills of this ilk never become law and some, like the one raised in South Carolina and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=HB5022" target="_blank" data-url="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=HB5022" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=SB1887" target="_blank" data-url="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=SB1887" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bills in Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, purposely make exceptions for certain uses of mRNA. However, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1808897" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1808897" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;others have been worded in ways&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that made it unclear whether any mRNA medicine is permissible. If any of such bills ultimately pass at the state level, that could sway where mRNA companies can manufacture products and run clinical trials, Coller said. So, while an exodus of expertise unfolds at a national level, we may see an echo of that at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="daaae7e4-b8c8-4b37-86a2-f8387141c502"&gt;The future of mRNA medicine in the U.S. rests on many "ifs," and the worst-case scenario may not come to pass. But in the face of staggering uncertainty, researchers in the field are starting to look for better bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's not fool ourselves: mRNA is one of the three most important molecules in the body, with the other two being DNA and protein. It's the intermediary between them," Coller said. "When the federal government sends a message that mRNA-based medicine and research is not wanted, you're basically saying that there's a whole branch of science that is no longer welcome within the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish (including salmon, herring, halibut, sardines, and tuna) provide long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which possess anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; EPA and DHA can help reduce the production of inflammatory molecules and compounds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Different fatty fish varieties yield different amounts of EPA/DHA, with wild salmon providing more than other fatty fish varieties at around 3 grams per 3-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats that the human body cannot produce, so you must obtain them through your diet. The three main types are:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

						Terry Becker, a retired fifth-grade teacher from Lancaster County, says he feels he's experiencing positive effects from one of two new FDA-approved drugs designed to slow the progression of certain types of Alzheimer's and dementia. Terry's wife, Pam, says she noticed his memory slipping months ago, leading to a neurological assessment that diagnosed him with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI.New Alzheimer's drugs While the causes of MCI, Alzheimer's and dementia remain unknown, doctors are concentrating on the buildup of amyloid protein in the brain. Two new drugs, Leqembi and Kisunla, have been introduced to help combat this issue."When these drugs became available, we were very excited. Now we have something that could potentially stop this process or greatly impact it," Dr. Matt Beelen, the medical director of the Alzheimer's and Memory Care Program at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, said."It changed the course for us and for our family," said Pam."It's getting rid of the protein, and it's helping to stabilize a memory and people that are on the drugs," Baleen added.Good and bad days"I do feel like I have a lot more good days than bad days, which is great," said Terry.Dr. Jesses Main, a clinical neuropsychologist working with Terry, expressed excitement about the new treatments.

						&lt;strong class="dateline"&gt;LANCASTER COUNTY, Pa. —&lt;/strong&gt; 													&lt;p&gt;Terry Becker, a retired fifth-grade teacher from Lancaster County, says he feels he's experiencing positive effects from one of two new FDA-approved drugs designed to slow the progression of certain types of Alzheimer's and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry's wife, Pam, says she noticed his memory slipping months ago, leading to a neurological assessment that diagnosed him with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="body-h2" id="new-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;New Alzheimer's drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the causes of MCI, Alzheimer's and dementia remain unknown, doctors are concentrating on the buildup of amyloid protein in the brain. Two new drugs, Leqembi and Kisunla, have been introduced to help combat this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When these drugs became available, we were very excited. Now we have something that could potentially stop this process or greatly impact it," Dr. Matt Beelen, the medical director of the Alzheimer's and Memory Care Program at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It changed the course for us and for our family," said Pam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cream-inline-rec" class="cream-inline hidden"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's getting rid of the protein, and it's helping to stabilize a memory and people that are on the drugs," Baleen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-h2" id="good-and-bad-days"&gt;Good and bad days&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do feel like I have a lot more good days than bad days, which is great," said Terry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jesses Main, a clinical neuropsychologist working with Terry, expressed excitement about the new treatments. Plus, Dr. Main says Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health is the only health system regionally offering comprehensive treatment, including initial assessments, infusion of these drugs, data collection and ongoing monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference room where Terry and Pam meet with their medical team is the same space where other patients receive important news.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York University School of Medicine and collaborators found that capillary-associated macrophages in skin decline with age, weakening microvascular repair and reducing perfusion in mice, with skin restoration possible after boosting local macrophage renewal with a growth factor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;h2&gt;Aging of capillary niches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages occupy distinct tissue niches that coordinate repair and function. Previous studies have linked &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/age-related+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;age-related decline&lt;/a&gt; in the density of capillaries to conditions including chronic wounds and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin hosts multiple resident macrophage populations across the epidermis, upper dermis, and lower dermis. Capillary networks in the superficial plexus support nutrient delivery to the epidermis, and prior work has associated microvascular rarefaction with aging across organs. Niche-level immune organization related to aging skin has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study design and goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Niche-specific dermal macrophage loss promotes skin &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/capillary/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;capillary&lt;/a&gt; ageing," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09639-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used intravital two-photon microscopy and complementary mouse genetics to determine how capillary-associated macrophages organize, renew, and sustain capillary function during physiological aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined live mouse footpad skin through repeated imaging sessions, covering animals aged 1 to 18 months in the main experiments and up to 24 months in supplementary analyses. Human analyses examined anterolateral chest skin from five young individuals under 40 and six individuals over 75, in quantified upper-dermal assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging fields focused on the upper dermis overlying the superficial capillary plexus, with repeat revisits to track the same microvascular territories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Testing the concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators set an objective to test whether local macrophage behavior governs repair of obstructed capillaries and whether age-linked macrophage loss causally impairs perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravital two-photon microscopy visualized macrophages. Functional tests combined laser-induced capillary clots with time-lapse tracking of local macrophage recruitment and phagocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejuvenation experiments administered intradermal growth factor CSF1–Fc for four days, followed by assessments of capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs), capillary flow, and return of blood flow after intentionally creating small, reproducible blockages in individual capillaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, can they restore old skin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results indicate restoration of microvascular perfusion and repair capacity in aged mouse skin when local macrophage numbers are boosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers increased capillary-associated macrophages in the skin using CSF1–Fc, then watched for what changed. Treated paws showed a significant rise in CAM density compared with controls, fewer obstructed capillary segments at rest, and better blood-flow recovery after capillary blockages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope remains limited to microvascular function in mice. Evidence for broader structural or functional rejuvenation of skin, or for efficacy in humans, is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human results confirmed that macrophages associated with capillaries decrease in older skin, paralleling what was seen in aged mice. The restoration technique was not tested on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+skin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that the findings support a model in which inadequate self-renewal and limited redistribution of capillary-associated macrophages permit gaps in coverage that grow with age, leaving segments vulnerable to obstruction and pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that niche-specific constraints on macrophage renewal represent an early, targetable contributor to tissue aging, with CSF1-based strategies offering a route to reversal, improving microvascular function and skin repair.&lt;/p&gt;

A quarter of the CDC has now been cut by multiple rounds of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1a988aa5-7f8a-4ea5-8130-5c256b108904" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New York declares state of emergency to issue food banks $65m amid shutdown","elementId":"1a988aa5-7f8a-4ea5-8130-5c256b108904","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/new-york-food-banks-emergency-shutdown"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some employees who had to work without pay through the shutdown received RIF notices; others who were furloughed learned they would never return to their jobs. Employees who were supposed to be protected from RIFs by an ongoing lawsuit received them anyway. The human resources department at CDC was brought back from unpaid furlough in order to process about 1,300 layoffs – and then their own, as the entire HR department was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the gutted departments are required by law to continue their work, despite having no employees. The ethics office and the institutional review board (IRB) were also ended, which means the CDC will no longer have oversight on ethical violations and research protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The entire library staff at the CDC, an integral part of research and recommendations, was terminated. The Washington office, which developed policy briefings and provided information to Congress members, was eliminated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Promotion, the national health and nutrition examination survey, and the staff focused on suicide prevention also suffered layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The multiple cuts across the agency mean the CDC is not able to carry out much of its work, even as some employees remain, said Karen Remley, who previously ran the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and was a state health official in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In April, for instance, the entire team behind the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams) was cut, which means a critical tool for understanding maternal and child health is now missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You can’t take out Prams and keep the registry and have all that work happen,” Remley said. “This artificial separating and splitting really means the work on the local level stops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, CDC employees have endured attacks and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On 8 August, a gunman fired 500 rounds of ammunition at the CDC headquarters, killing David Rose, an officer, and traumatizing agency employees and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health agency employees have been doxed, with their identities and personal information revealed. Matthew Buckham, Kennedy’s acting chief of staff, was co-founder of the group that maintains a “DEI Watch List” targeting HHS employees. The agency has also been roiled by high-profile &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/rfk-jr-senate-hearing-cdc-susan-monarez" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;departures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the highest level of leadership in the CDC, there are no public health or medical professionals left to help guide CDC recommendations,” said Abigail Tighe, a former CDC employee and founding member of the National Public Health Coalition, which held a recent press conference where Backus and other former CDC employees spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Billions in contracts and direct funding to state and local public health agencies has been canceled or clawed back, and the American people are cued up to suffer. It is hard to succinctly put into words what the decimation of the CDC means for everyday Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first round of layoffs at CDC came on Valentine’s day. Probationary employees – who were in the first year or two of their jobs, either because they had been recently hired or had moved to new positions – along with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/20/trump-fired-health-employees" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;established senior employees&lt;/a&gt; received notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.261.0.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in September that the probationary terminations went too far and some of the employees were reinstated and placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, RIF notices went out on 1 April, eliminating entire offices such as the office on smoking and health, where Backus worked. She didn’t even receive the notice at first because her access to the CDC network, including email, had been cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lawsuit specifically prevents employees like Backus from being reorganized into new offices or terminated from the agency, she said. That’s why she thought she would be safe this time – but she still received a third layoff notice. That notice was rescinded after less than 24 hours. About 700 employees were reinstated, while 600 &lt;a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/cdc-job-cuts-partial-reversal" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;remain terminated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still remain on administrative leave, unable to do my job,” Backus said. “My situation just highlights the chaos and confusion that federal employees have experienced over the past year. I’m stuck in limbo, following court cases, gathering information, and trying to figure out what my next steps should be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Charlotte Kent, former editor-in-chief of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), said: “We have so many people who, if they’ve been [un-RIFed], have been on administrative leave. We have the inefficiency of so many government resources, our taxpayer dollars, going to fight the illegal activities that have been done by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The MMWR was among the departments completely gutted and then reinstated – which was particularly surprising, because the highly regarded scientific journal was specifically included in the president’s budget request for the first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To have it cut at this point is just shocking,” Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s like being in a strange game where there’s no rules,” said one former CDC employee who was RIFed on 10 October and spoke anonymously to avoid reprisal from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s honestly like Squid Games – we don’t know what’s going to happen next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Brooks, who retired last year from the CDC after 26 years and served as the chief medical officer for several emergency responses, said the RIFs demonstrated a “stunning level of incompetency”. Firing the CDC Washington staff means “Congress no longer has a means of direct access to the agency it funds when it needs information or briefings”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-live-updates-as-military-poised-to-miss-first-paychecks-next-week/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; says about 700 of the terminations were a coding error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is clear to us that this was not a coding error,” said Tighe. “This RIF was carried out just as all the other ones have been, where they fire as many people as they think they can get away with, there’s public outcry, there’s outcry from congressional members and then they bring back the things that they think people cannot get over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She called the firings “an intentional attack on the American people and the public’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our country is on an uncertain and frankly frightening path,” Tighe said. “We would love to see Congress step in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNejJUUTZISC1UOUtOdlVMOU5jczR0eHloTXZ6RFlpdjFnWVJMUjZ6aExyQURPNXNFeHFlVXVTaHFldGY2UkxHc0FBNnk4S1BIQUFDc2diSmJMMGd1c3YzaGpPd1EzREVEZmRxQmN4RjU3d3RmTXpaVzdJVVpZWVMzQi1BZ2taSE83</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州医生转诊的病人因踝关节手术、过夜住院而被$ 64,000的账单绊倒-《丹佛邮报》</title><link>https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/31/surprise-medical-bill-colorado/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julie Appleby,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital, &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/intermountain-health-platte-valley-hospital"&gt;Platte Valley Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shaken Hughes was examined in the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bruising, a deep cut on her knee, and a broken ankle. Physicians recommended immediate surgical repair, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said: ‘You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. We need to take you to the OR to wash it out and make sure there’s no infection,’” she said. “As a clinician, I thought, ‘Yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was taken to the operating room in the early evening, then admitted to the hospital overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend took her home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Medical Procedure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cleaned the cut on her right knee, which had hit her car’s dashboard, and realigned a broken bone in her right ankle, stabilizing it with metal screws. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;h4&gt;The Final Bill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$63,976.35, charged by the hospital — which was not in-network with the insurance plan she got through her job — for the surgery and overnight stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Problem: Should I Stay or Should I Go?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes’ insurer, Anthem, fully covered the nearly $2,400 ambulance ride and some smaller radiology charges from the ER, but denied the surgery and overnight stay charges from the out-of-network hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage,” Hughes said. “Just to stay there overnight. It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers have broad power to determine &lt;a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/consumer-health-insurance-what-is-medical-necessity.pdf"&gt;whether care is medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; — that is, what is needed for treatment, diagnosis, or relief. And that decision affects whether and how much they will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. “The information we have does not show you have these or other severe problems,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Hughes, the notion that she should have left the hospital was “ludicrous.” Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy’s benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show “safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem’s agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of “comprehensive, complex medical care” that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes’ ankle surgery was medically necessary,” Snooks wrote. “However, because the ankle surgery was bundled with the inpatient admission, the entire claim was denied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn’t shielded by the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/no-surprises-understand-your-rights-against-surprise-medical-bills"&gt;No Surprises Act&lt;/a&gt;, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost,” said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. “But the No Surprises Act is not going to override the normal medical necessity determination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight “observation” stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, that’s when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. Rather than being tied to the stay’s duration, the designation mainly reflects the intensity of care. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/skilled-nursing-facility-care#:~:text=You%20may%20not,for%20more%20information."&gt;any care needed in a nursing home&lt;/a&gt; if the patient was not first formally admitted to a &lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/11-years-of-the-two-midnight-rule-how-a-controversial-policy-is-shaping-medicare-and-hospital-admissions-in-2024/#:~:text=The%20length%20of,patient%E2%80%99s%20financial%20responsibility."&gt;hospital for at least three days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a classic battle between providers and insurers as to what bucket a claim falls in,” Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Resolution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician and a &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/farleyhealthpolicycenter/who-we-are/farley-center-staff/lauren-hughes"&gt;director of a health policy center at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt;, Hughes is a savvier-than-usual policyholder. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer’s human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/send-us-your-medical-bills/"&gt;reached out to KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had “downgraded the level of care” the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility “deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her.” The hospital had “prematurely” and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a careful review of Ms. Hughes’ situation,” Quale continued, “we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes’ bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for “outpatient care services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. The insurer paid the hospital nearly $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as “post-stabilization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;stable enough to travel&lt;/a&gt; to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;to sign a consent form&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important that if they give you some kind of letter to sign that you read that letter very carefully, because that letter might give them your permission to get some big bills,” Hoadley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital’s billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her advice is to quickly and aggressively question insurance denials once they are received, including by asking for your case to be escalated to the insurer’s and hospital’s leadership. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was calling family,” Hughes said, “alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

If it rises significantly, surgery and/or radiation are more aggressive treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UU5SG7KGFZAR5CFJ4ADJJU5LMU"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more of Roy’s ‘&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3N3FPPSUJFE2NK6NHAH2VACUEQ"&gt;My PSA score in July was 4-almost-5, a spike from prior annual tests, which prompted my primary care physician to send me to a urologist.

I’ve long held onto Isaiah 40:31 as one of my go-to scriptures, knowing that &lt;i&gt;those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength&lt;/i&gt;. It became my mantra as my wife and I navigated the waves of treatment options, including surgery and/or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K6AN4O7TEJHFBHW7TGIPRM445Y"&gt;My cancer was deemed stage 2, a slow-moving cancer confirmed by a genetic test. And because I caught it early, thanks to regular PSA testing at annual checkups, active surveillance was a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ROPDRLCLXRH4VG4VRFRF2DQAXY"&gt;And it’s the one we chose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XV4J4QFJVZG2FJBEHUTFIWW4FU"&gt;I am not alone, surprisingly. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/well/live/prostate-cancer-treatment-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;The New York Times published an overview of prostate cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; and I learned that “today &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335873/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;nearly 60 percent of patients&lt;/a&gt; with low-risk cancers choose active monitoring instead of treatment — up from 26 percent in 2014. Some experts believe that number should be higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ALJHAIVNFVEL5PJOISPJNYAK5A"&gt;I am &lt;i&gt;far &lt;/i&gt;from alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4WBFLBILFVBUPNX7OKTXMSQHFY"&gt;So, yes, I am waiting because I know &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012%3A9&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;His power is made perfect in our weakness&lt;/a&gt;. And cancer is a profound weakness that, even as treatments of almost all forms of the disease have drastically improved in my near-70 years of life, kills far too many. Far too many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ABKLHLKDEFCQBMSFCJ5DEYJEIQ"&gt;My treatment, however, isn’t called waiting. It’s &lt;i&gt;surveillance&lt;/i&gt; — and my cancer was caught soon enough for me to pursue this path. Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LUHGWAQRLRCPTO7N6YEZPMFFEA"&gt;It’s been almost two months now since I revealed my diagnosis.

People who are sharing their own personal cancer journeys with me. I find myself praying for as many as are praying for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7DWV47KV5DVRADRHD4USODYTY"&gt;That’s why I consider myself a cancer survivor. I know the term. It’s generally meant for those who’ve rung the bell.

To be clear: I may still have cancer in my body. My next PSA test isn’t scheduled for a long while, but I am fully confident in this — I am a survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGY5VQB5XVBTLFHBYHQXFVKTSE"&gt;I survived anxiety.

I joined the board of directors of the&lt;a href="https://mikeslivefoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Mike Slive Foundation for Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;, which provides early-stage grants for potentially groundbreaking efforts to cure for prostate cancer, and host free PSA testing at various events across Alabama and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5BY2KYGKONDF5IZVAXQNTOCOAY"&gt;I am also an ambassador for&lt;a href="https://nowincluded.com/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; NowIncluded&lt;/a&gt;, an online community where people in underrepresented communities are heard and supported throughout their health journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GCDVMF2JDJD5TMI62V6QIOWB3A"&gt;Both entities are committed to saving lives.

Viewers are finding them enlightening and comforting as many people  — mainly women — are undiagnosed as they reach adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://neurodivergentinsights.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Megan Anna Neff;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Megan Anna Neff&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Oregon, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35204992/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a recent study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that 80% of women with autism are still undiagnosed at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many reasons for this: For starters, people learn to adjust their behavior to fit in with society. Additionally,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the autism diagnostic tools used today were developed exclusively on white boys from high socioeconomic status, said &lt;a href="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephanie Gardner-Wright;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stephanie Gardner-Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed master social worker and certified autism clinical specialist in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is also a huge focus on the external signs and not so much the internal symptoms of autism, Gardner-Wright said. And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Pixelcatchers / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurengarafano/doctors-share-little-things-people-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Sharing The 16 &amp;quot;Tiny&amp;quot; Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Sharing The 16 "Tiny" Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brandon Tessers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Vanessa Bal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; said folks describe it as “a lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oliver Rossi / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Peopleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/scarymouse/doctors-sharing-mild-symptoms-actually-serious-medical-3?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Simpleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tatiana Maksimova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredictable. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. When a routine is disrupted, strong &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface, and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-lies-medical-myths?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;There Is No Cure&amp;quot;: Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health &amp;quot;Lies&amp;quot; People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"There Is No Cure": Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health "Lies" People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jordan Siemens / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “They’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Natalia Lebedinskaia / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular activity or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tom Werner / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-warning-signs-symptoms-shouldnt-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The &amp;quot;Small&amp;quot; Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Manu Vega / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/what-kind-of-dog-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “What we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:#actuallyautistic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;#actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:embrace-autism.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Olga Pankova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, a community of supportive people can be helpful as well, which is where the #actuallyaustic hashtag — or other online communities — can be helpful.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-9-biggest-signs-of-autism-in-adulthood-goog_l_68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-bad-health-habits?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"They Had No Idea How Dangerous It Was."

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68947766"&gt;invoked the specter of insect-eating&lt;/a&gt; when he banned the production and sale of cultivated meat in his state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These claims frequently accompany advocacy for meat-heavy, protein-packed diets — ascendant within the so-called &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets"&gt;manosphere and&lt;/a&gt; across the right more broadly — that ostensibly hearken back to our Paleolithic ancestors, who, the thinking goes, dined on freshly-hunted prey instead of the processed slop churned out by our modern food system. Jordan Peterson, for instance, is a vocal proponent of an all-meat carnivore diet, which he &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLF29w6YqXs"&gt;compares favorably&lt;/a&gt; to the diets of hunter-gatherers and contrasts to contemporary diets he suggests have too many carbohydrates. “Maybe human beings should be in hunting mode all the time,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Sza90czz0"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate widely divergent diets shaped by climate, geography, and availability. And while they certainly ate meat, they had no guarantee of successful hunts and scant means of preserving fresh kills. In fact, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, that presents a peculiar twist: Putrefying meat attracted flies, which laid eggs that hatched into maggots, which in turn probably provided a ready source of protein to early hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ironically, then, part of the Paleolithic diet likely &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Carnivore influencers misunderstand not just where ancient humans got their animal protein, but also how much of it they ate. In &lt;em&gt;The Meat Question&lt;/em&gt;, a sprawling history of humans’ relationship to meat, anthropologist Josh Berson &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262042895/the-meat-question/"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;: “if anything, it is ‘modern’ urban populations, particularly in the United States, that exhibit specialization for animal consumption — not the foragers so often held up as models of a meat-eating subsistence strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, those who suggest that we’ve fallen from pre-modern meat-eating &lt;em&gt;übermen&lt;/em&gt; to plant-gnawing and bug-curious &lt;em&gt;untermen &lt;/em&gt;have their history backward. It was only with the advent of modern factory farming that meat became so reliable and ubiquitous that Americans can now eat it three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="read-more-vox-coverage-of-the-science-culture-and-politics-of-meat" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Read more Vox coverage of the science, culture, and politics of meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Myths about how we used to eat and, perhaps, should eat again, matter politically now more than ever. The image of prehistoric man the hunter looms over contemporary “&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/644298?seq=2"&gt;gastro-politics&lt;/a&gt;,” reflecting pervasive social and political anxieties about the food we eat. The Make America Healthy Again movement has been buoyed by a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/dining/meat-beef-restaurants-politics.html"&gt;growing cultural obsession&lt;/a&gt; with carnivore and paleo diets &lt;a href="/future-perfect/410565/protein-muscle-gain-weightlifting-plant-based-vegan"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/podcasts/the-daily/protein-bars-america.html"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; — entrails, tallow, and marrow &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/maga-cow-products-beef-tallow"&gt;are all chic&lt;/a&gt;; there &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/meat-will-make-america-healthy-again-federal-guidelines-nutrition-reform-protein-eded2b3e"&gt;are calls&lt;/a&gt; to double down on meat in federal nutrition guidelines. All of it dovetails with &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/193307/nature-solutionism-vaccines-beef-climate"&gt;a romanticization&lt;/a&gt; of “natural” pre-modern food system and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;a distrust&lt;/a&gt; of all things “industrial” and “ultra-processed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s hardly just a right-wing phenomenon. The use of Paleolithic humans as dietary role models isn’t so different from mainstream foodie mantras about ancestral diets like author Michael Pollan’s &lt;a href="https://time.com/archive/6677424/six-rules-for-eating-wisely/"&gt;famous advice&lt;/a&gt;: “Don’t eat anything your great-great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.” More recently, Pollan has fretted that the environmental benefits of meat alternatives may be offset by vague concerns about the health and safety of their “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/06/the-man-who-warned-us-about-upfs-michael-pollan-on-his-25-year-fight-with-the-food-industry"&gt;21 ingredients or whatever&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This sort of bias toward the traditional can sometimes result in what we might term “foodie horseshoe theory”: For instance, in his book &lt;em&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;, Pollan, a liberal Berkeley professor, idealizes the small-scale livestock rancher Joel Salatin, an anti-government agrarian who appears on carnivore diet advocate Jordan Peterson’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMjqphoMy0k"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; to attack veganism, “globalists,” and processed food alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For both left and right, myths about a romanticized past bolster present-day identities, politics, and eating habits while shielding them from debate about the food future we ought to create. Of the many problems with the modern food system, a paucity of meat is not one; research on food’s environmental impacts &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01201-2/abstract"&gt;points us toward&lt;/a&gt; the need to &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"&gt;massively reduce meat consumption&lt;/a&gt;. But tackling that problem, and many others, means we first need to abandon myths rooted in bad history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-even-was-the-prehistoric-diet" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What even was the prehistoric diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; in 2017, in the midst of the paleo diet craze, renowned paleontologist Peter Ungar challenged not just the diet itself but its very epistemological foundations. “What was the ancestral human diet? The question itself makes no sense,” he &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/the-true-human-diet/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. What most distinguishes the human diet is its &lt;a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/meat-eating-among-the-earliest-humans"&gt;incredible adaptability&lt;/a&gt; across time and space. Our ancestors have, over the millennia, adapted to eating what was available in whatever quantities it was available. As Ungar noted, that can mean diets made up of almost entirely animal flesh and fat, or one consisting of mostly roots, tubers, and fruit. Trying to pin down a single “Paleolithic” or “ancestral” diet is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While the idea of Paleolithic eating summons images of humans as “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.24247"&gt;hypercarnivores&lt;/a&gt;,” or apex predators, humans are not naturally obligate carnivores like big cats. We are omnivores, capable of deriving nutrients from a vast variety of plant and animal sources. The role that meat played in our evolution, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047248489900353"&gt;how much of it we ate&lt;/a&gt;, and how we got it (&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25801183.pdf"&gt;theories of scavenging carrion abound alongside those of near-constant hunting&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2115540119"&gt;remains the subject of vigorous debate among scholars&lt;/a&gt;, with plausible estimates, depending on the population, time period, and ecological context, ranging from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11090808/"&gt;very little&lt;/a&gt; to quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;What was the ancestral human diet?

It sometimes involves, quite literally, sifting through the trash of ancient peoples. &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/vertebrate-taphonomy/46D04213E462D5EAFF36C106EA192978"&gt;Animal bones&lt;/a&gt; with damage from fire, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X24001421"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt;, and butchering, for instance, can confirm animals were eaten, although it is difficult to determine frequency and quantity. While modern discussions of Paleolithic diets center on meat from a small number of livestock species farmed and eaten today, our ancestors ate a wide range of creatures, many now extinct or no longer used for food; the archeological record shows that rats, for example, were probably paleo-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Genomic and proteomic (protein) &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.0977"&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; of fossilized material can also help shed light on ancient diets, and the chemical composition of human bones offers additional clues. The notion among some scholars that early humans ate a superabundance of meat comes not just from ideas about their hunting habits gleaned from the fossil record, but also from high levels of stable nitrogen isotopes in fossilized skeletons, which can suggest high consumption of offal. But science progresses on proposing and testing alternative explanations, and researchers have more recently suggested &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612646/"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; — and, now, maggots — as a source of all that nitrogen. The latter suggestion, put forth in the new &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, is rooted in the theory that meat, a relatively scarce resource, would be kept around even as it rotted — not just to be eaten, but also to allow maggots to hatch to provide a steady source of fresh, bite-size protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, much of this is educated guesswork. Thus, many theories about ancestral diets are also supplemented with evidence from the eating habits of contemporary &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-nutr-111120-105520"&gt;hunter-gatherer societies&lt;/a&gt;, who act as empirically studiable stand-ins for long-gone ancestors. Ungar, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/the-true-human-diet/"&gt;contrasts&lt;/a&gt; the largely carnivorous fare of Alaska’s Tikiġaġmiut people with the plant-rich diets of the Gwi San people of the Kalahari. The authors of the &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; paper back up their archaeological sleuthing with historical reports of 19th-century Arctic and subarctic hunter-gatherer societies eating maggots growing in stored animal carcasses. Both the fossil and ethnohistorical records, they conclude, reveal early human populations not as hypercarnivores but as omnivorous opportunists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The closer we come to contemporary society, the more we know with greater certainty about what our ancestors ate. And here, too, the historical record fails to support ideas of persistent carnivory. If anything, the domestication of livestock, which first began to appear in the archaeological record 12,000 years ago, likely diminished meat’s role in human diets: Through millennia, farmed animals were often more valuable alive than dead, as a source of milk, wool, labor, and fertilizer, and as a store of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In medieval Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/ubiquitous-medieval-pigs"&gt;butchering pigs&lt;/a&gt; was a highly seasonal ritual, sometimes reserved for special occasions; in Imperial China, pigs &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/envhis/emq143"&gt;were a symbol&lt;/a&gt; of prosperity; throughout much of South Asia, cattle regularly supplied dairy and manure, but beef consumption was forbidden. Far from being a dietary staple, meat’s role was fluid: by turns a sacred offering, a show of wealth, or a winter fallback. And in most cases, meat intake remained relatively low, at least by modern standards, until the &lt;a href="https://cadmus.eui.eu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3f848502-2a76-5370-a58c-597de9f19d68/content"&gt;very recent past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t until around the turn of the 20th century that animal agriculture was industrialized. The adoption of assembly-line systems in slaughterhouses allowed for economies-of-scale killing of animals and standardization of cuts of meat, while selective breeding practices &lt;a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Creating_Abundance.html?id=pjl7ywhnCCwC&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y"&gt;dramatically enhanced livestock productivity&lt;/a&gt;. As historian William Cronon &lt;a href="https://commonplace.online/article/natures-metropolis-at-30/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt;, these advances, coupled with new technology like refrigerated rail cars and canning, quickly turned meat into a ubiquitous commodity. As crop agriculture also industrialized, animal feed became cheap, allowing for the advent of factory farms where animals like pigs and chickens were raised indoors for their entire lives and bred to grow to slaughter weight rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These extremely recent changes remade humanity’s relationship to meat. Over the past century, the entire agricultural value chain has been redesigned to feed, raise, and kill animals on an ever-greater scale. In 1909, just over 150 million chickens were sold for slaughter in the US. By 1949, &lt;a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41667073v5p6ch4.pdf"&gt;that number was close to 600 million&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, it was &lt;a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/pg15bd88s/k356c167m/z029r057b/pslaan25.pdf"&gt;9.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past half-century, American meat production has increased almost threefold and global meat production fivefold, a transformation that geographer Tony Weis has called the “&lt;a href="https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/towards-120-billion"&gt;meatification&lt;/a&gt;” of our food system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Modern humans, as much as our Paleolithic ancestors, as much as our great-great-grandparents, adapt our diets to our surroundings. And surrounded by ever-greater quantities of cheap meat, we ate more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="can-we-please-be-serious-about-food-policy" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Can we please be serious about food policy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Modern diets are fraught with anxiety, and with good reason. There is much about modernity and the modern food system to be anxious about, from its contribution to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.518039/full#h9"&gt;global climate change&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/well/eat/food-additive-ban.html"&gt;potential health impacts of some food additives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These are real problems, of course, but an anxious frame rooted in hyperbole, cliche, and nostalgia for free-grazing pigs doesn’t offer a clear perspective on what’s needed to address them. Instead, it serves up simplistic answers, like a wholesale rejection of modernity. But, ironically, hostility toward modern food technology and an effective regulatory state, whether by the foodie gurus, carnivore podcasters, &lt;a href="https://drjessicaknurick.substack.com/p/food-additives-and-the-maha-disconnect"&gt;MAHA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/24158356/raw-milk-pasteurization-h5n1-bird-flu-sales-consumption-government-trust"&gt;raw milk enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2025/4/thousands-of-fda-staff-fired-in-latest-rif"&gt;DOGE cost-cutters&lt;/a&gt;, might very well &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the quantity of rotting meat (and perhaps maggots) in our food, &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674728776"&gt;a problem in 19th-century America&lt;/a&gt; before the creation of the FDA and the widespread adoption of food refrigeration and preservation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Consider that the modern food system is, on balance, a great thing. Diseases of malnutrition &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27780/chapter-abstract/198026487?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;like pellagra and rickets&lt;/a&gt; have been banished to the past, as have the dangers of eating &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27780/chapter-abstract/198024009?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;contaminated, toxic, spoiled, or adulterated foods&lt;/a&gt;. It is only because &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20752979?mag=decline-malnutrition-world-eats-now&amp;amp;seq=1"&gt;food is more abundant, affordable, and safe&lt;/a&gt; than at any other time in human history that we can spare any attention to the chronic, long-term problems to which modern diets contribute, like obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Addressing those problems means embracing modernity rather than rejecting it. It requires actually engaging with the complexity of the food system, and facing up to a few uncomfortable truths, like the fact that it is meat in particular, and not food generally, that drives many of the food system’s harms. But in the face of complexity, a retreat to an unspoiled past offers both an escapist fantasy free of difficult tradeoffs and a handy justification for our worst dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In an imagined past, meat consumption acts as a potent political signifier that binds us to our tribe. And food becomes a theater for performing politics and identity. For foodies who sneer at “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/02/mark-bittman-community-kitchen-restaurants"&gt;industrial food&lt;/a&gt;,” going back to small farms and eating supposedly “better” organic and regeneratively farmed meat may signal a commitment to &lt;a href="https://repprovisions.com/pages/why-rep-regenerative-beef-is-healthier-for-you?srsltid=AfmBOoo5pvvIi1MisWXWWH0l_VPhQ_SeHqrXjT8ThZAHNFyNSzbdFEDx"&gt;personal health and environmental justice&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/23/organic-meat-production-just-as-bad-for-climate-study-finds"&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.816374/full"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/better-meat-sourcing-climate-environmental-impacts"&gt;borne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13165-025-00493-w"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163735/myth-regenerative-ranching"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; science. On the right, the embrace of meat &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets"&gt;anchors a particular vision of politics&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5003066/beef-climate-change-american-men-masculinity"&gt;masculinity&lt;/a&gt; — that is fundamentally anti-modern, anti-liberal, and anti-“woke.” And so the modern food system (junk), liberal men (soy boys), and scientists and experts (globalists) can all be framed as an assault on a fundamental and personal bodily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But rather than a transgressive return to a lost past, meat-heavy diets not only represent the status quo but also rely entirely on the modern food system and its globe-spanning networks of exchange, cutting-edge logistics and infrastructure, highly capitalized multinational corporations, and sophisticated biotechnologies. Close factory farms and industrialized cattle feedlots, &lt;a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates"&gt;and 99 percent of chicken, 98 percent of pork, and 75 percent of beef&lt;/a&gt; in the US disappear overnight, making mass-scale carnivory impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;As is often the case with myths, those about ancestral diets are more about the anxieties and identities of their purveyors than it is about a real past or even a real present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Paradoxically, then, those who champion pre-modern diets can do so only because of the amenities and technologies of the modern world. At no other point in human history could someone opt for the meat of their choice for three meals every day, without getting any blood on their own hands, and then post about it on social media to claim they are living like their ancestors. If anything, the myth of meat’s transhistorical importance masks the fact that the meatiness of current diets is a historical flash in the pan, the result of a food system focused on overproducing meat, not an evolved set of inherent needs or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As is often the case with myths, those about Paleolithic, ancestral, and great-great-grandmotherly diets are more about the anxieties and identities of their purveyors than it is about a real past or even a real present. The very image of the primitive prehistoric hunter is less careful archeology and ethnography than it is a product of &lt;a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/refuting-a-myth-about-human-origins"&gt;modern misconceptions about human evolution&lt;/a&gt; mixed with &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/683202"&gt;popular culture pastiche&lt;/a&gt;, which makes self-styled primitivism quintessentially post-modern, as if the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-what-they-took-from-us-and-unbelievable-honkers-right-wing-nostalgia"&gt;this is what they took from us&lt;/a&gt;” meme was slapped over a picture of Fred Flintstone eating dinosaur ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;History shows us that there is no single way humans have eaten and no predetermined way we should eat. Diets are a product of the world we live in. And in that world, the questions we should be asking are not about what our ancestors ate — and whether we should therefore eat meat, berries, or maggots — but about what rational decisions we can make about our future. That includes asking why meat is so cheap and easy to buy, and whether it ought to remain so. The answers lie in science, public health, and political economy, and not in myths. The diets of the long dead are a red herring at best, red meat for reactionary politics at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQbThIOVF5NmNCNE5WTUdOOHhtS2o2S2JRRjFNUWRqQmhneXM4QnNkVWR6YXoydFFLV2dYbmltWXpnN1FZN183Q0h1Z0U3ZEN2VzdNYXNOQVhJRmZBRTFUMWUyeFBTdEpScHFWZDRmTW1EazhZZ1A5cDFjWTFCRGo3X3h3RE5WX1U3cTgwWEVZZDNRRFE4MTVudA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，多动症与犯罪风险之间的家族联系部分是遗传性的- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/familial-link-between-adhd-and-crime-risk-is-partly-genetic-study-suggests/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that individuals with ADHD have a higher risk of being convicted of a crime, and reveals this connection also extends to their family members. The research suggests that shared genetics are a meaningful part of the explanation for this link. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.10.007" target="_blank"&gt;Biological Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the findings show that the risk of a criminal conviction increases with the degree of genetic relatedness to a relative with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between ADHD and an increased likelihood of criminal activity is well-documented. Past research indicates that individuals with ADHD are two to three times more likely to be arrested or convicted of a crime. Scientists have also established that both ADHD and criminality have substantial genetic influences, with heritability estimates around 70-80% for ADHD and approximately 50% for criminal behavior. This overlap led researchers to hypothesize that shared genetic factors might partly explain the association between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some previous studies hinted at a familial connection, they were often limited to specific types of crime or a small number of relative types. The current research aimed to provide a more complete picture. The investigators sought to understand how the risk for criminal convictions co-aggregates, or clusters, within families across a wide spectrum of relationships, from identical twins to cousins. They also wanted to examine potential differences in these patterns between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ADHD is linked to higher rates of crime, but it’s unclear why. We studied families to see whether shared genetic or environmental factors explain this connection, aiming to better understand how early support could reduce risk,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.oru.se/english/employee/sofi_oskarsson" target="_blank"&gt;Sofi Oskarsson&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher and senior lecturer in criminology at Örebro University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the investigation, researchers utilized Sweden’s comprehensive national population registers. They analyzed data from a cohort of over 1.5 million individuals born in Sweden between 1987 and 2002. ADHD cases were identified through clinical diagnoses or prescriptions for ADHD medication recorded in national health registers. Information on criminal convictions for any crime, violent crime, or non-violent crime was obtained from the National Crime Register, with the analysis beginning from an individual’s 15th birthday, the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design allowed researchers to estimate the risk of a criminal conviction for an individual based on whether a relative had ADHD. By comparing these risks across different types of relatives who share varying amounts of genetic material—identical twins (100%), fraternal twins and full siblings (average 50%), half-siblings (average 25%), and cousins (average 12.5%)—the team could infer the potential role of shared genes and environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results first confirmed that individuals with an ADHD diagnosis had a substantially higher risk of being convicted of a crime compared to those without ADHD. The risk was particularly elevated for violent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis also revealed a significant gender difference: while men with ADHD had higher absolute numbers of convictions, women with ADHD had a greater relative increase in risk compared to women without the disorder. For violent crime, the risk was over eight times higher for women with ADHD, while it was about five times higher for men with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps not a surprise given what we know today about ADHD, but the stronger associations found among women were very interesting and important,” Oskarsson told PsyPost. “ADHD is not diagnosed as often in females (or is mischaracterized), so the higher relative risk in women suggest that when ADHD is present, it may reflect a more severe or concentrated set of risk factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central finding of the study was the clear pattern of familial co-aggregation. Having a relative with ADHD was associated with an increased personal risk for a criminal conviction. This risk followed a gradient based on genetic relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest risk was observed in individuals whose identical twin had ADHD, followed by fraternal twins and full siblings. The risk was progressively lower for half-siblings and cousins. This pattern, where the association weakens as genetic similarity decreases, points toward the influence of shared genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Close relatives of people with ADHD were much more likely to have criminal convictions, especially twins, supporting a genetic contribution,” Oskarsson explained. “But the link is not deterministic, most individuals with ADHD or affected relatives are not convicted, emphasizing shared risk, not inevitability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the stronger relative risk for women was not limited to individuals with ADHD. A similar pattern appeared in some familial relationships, specifically among full siblings and full cousins, where the association between a relative’s ADHD and a woman’s conviction risk was stronger than for men. This suggests that the biological and environmental mechanisms connecting ADHD and crime may operate differently depending on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with ADHD are at a higher risk of criminality, but this risk also extend to their relatives,” Oskarsson said. “This pattern suggest that some of the link between ADHD and crime stems from shared genetic and/or environmental factors. Importantly, this does not mean that ADHD causes crime, but that the two share underlying vulnerabilities. Recognizing and addressing ADHD early, especially in families, could reduce downstream risks and improve outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, the researchers acknowledge some limitations. The study’s reliance on official medical records may primarily capture more severe cases of ADHD, and conviction data does not account for all criminal behavior. Because the data comes from Sweden, a country with universal healthcare, the findings may not be directly generalizable to countries with different social or legal systems. The authors also note that the large number of statistical comparisons means the overall consistency of the patterns is more important than any single result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these associations in different cultural and national contexts to see if the patterns hold. Further investigation is also needed to identify the specific genetic and environmental pathways that contribute to the shared risk between ADHD and criminal convictions. These findings could help inform risk assessment and prevention efforts, but the authors caution that such knowledge must be applied carefully to avoid stigmatization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to know more about why ADHD and criminality are connected, which symptoms or circumstances matter most, and whether early support for individuals and families can help break that link,” Oskarsson added. “This study underscores the importance of viewing ADHD within a broader family and societal context. Early support for ADHD doesn’t just help the individual, it can have ripple effects that extend across families and communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.10.007" target="_blank"&gt;The Familial Co-Aggregation of ADHD and Criminal Convictions: A Register-Based Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sofi Oskarsson, Ralf Kuja-Halkola, Anneli Andersson, Catherine Tuvblad, Isabell Brikell, Brian D’Onofrio, Zheng Chang, and Henrik Larsson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:03:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOSVpQWi0ya3MxdmE4cXZKenV1R09yekxrVFU2WVVKbVcxYlZHUy0xRTBLTGlZQ19NNHNMN0wtdE81R21iRjhCRDNBME12WW9ZNVhESEJnaVFEV0FRdEtXUTV5ZXQ1NWROWE1LeUEzYnhoWWNmS3ZPUzVhV0hBeW5DbEptTmJIR00wQ2I3MXNHdUtCRVQwMUFXWnFhU2x1Wmph</guid></item><item><title>患者的声音揭示了患有慢性睡眠障碍特发性嗜睡症的现实- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-patient-voices-reveal-reality-chronic.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare, chronic neurological disorder that causes people to feel excessively sleepy during the day, even after getting a full night's rest. Other symptoms include severe difficulty waking up and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;To develop better treatments and improve diagnosis, research should ideally take into account patients' voices and what individuals are really going through. A new study analyzing online posts by people with this disorder has revealed that many never truly feel awake, trapped between sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet searches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers scoured the internet and reviewed 346 pieces of content, including posts, blogs and videos created by 123 participants from several countries between 2012 and 2022. They began with broad search terms like "idiopathic hypersomnia patient story" and more specific terms such as "IH relationship impact" to find spontaneous discussions about the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content was collected manually from platforms like Facebook and Reddit as well as podcasts, ensuring the insights were organic and not shaped by research questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient stories, transcripts and posts were organized into major symptom themes (including relentless sleepiness, never fully awake and limited &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;) and life impacts (including strained relationships and limitations on work and school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Key findings and impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0333497" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;, revealed four key findings about the realities of living with IH. Patients endure nonrestorative sleep, meaning no amount of sleep is refreshing, and they never feel fully awake, with some describing their experience as living "underwater." Individuals also exhibit automatic behavior, performing tasks without conscious memory, and constantly struggle with limited physical energy.&lt;/p&gt;

The emotional toll can be severe, as one participant powerfully articulated. "It is a testament both to an excellent therapist and my immense willpower that I learned to cope with IH well enough to want to remain alive. I do not say that lightly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the limitation that this study only captures the experiences of patients who are actively sharing their information publicly online, this new understanding of the patient condition should be a valuable resource. It can help doctors improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical care&lt;/a&gt;, drive &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug development&lt;/a&gt;, and raise awareness of IH, as the researchers state in their paper: "These insights can help clinicians provide better care, drive patient-centered drug development, and raise awareness of this devastating disorder."&lt;/p&gt;

Up until now, Rybelsus was known as a diabetes medication and was only taken in cases of increased blood sugar levels, in adults with type 2 diabetes. But with this new approval, its use has been expanded to include people who are at risk of already living with cardiovascular diseases, marking a big step towards preventative health care and treatment accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since heart diseases are on the rise, this approval became necessary, and it represents a significant advancement in modern medicine. Rybelsus is also known as oral semaglutide, which is a needle-free solution for those seeking to improve cardiovascular health, while also supporting blood sugar and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Rybelsus works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This medication belongs to a class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. These drugs mimic the natural hormone GLP-1, which plays a key role in controlling blood sugar, managing appetite and digestion. Beyond the usual metabolic effects, which most of the medications have, new research has uncovered Rybelsus's protective effects on heart and blood vessels as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two major drivers of heart attack- oxidative stress and arterial inflammation- Rybelsus works to reduce both of these culprits and improves endothelial function, which is the health of the inner lining of blood vessels, critical for maintaining smooth blood flow and preventing blood clot formation. Studies show that GLP-1 receptor agonists can make platelets (the tiny blood components responsible for clotting) less sticky, reducing the risk of dangerous clots that can block arteries. Additionally, the drug has lipid-lowering effects, helping to reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, and mild diuretic properties that help the body manage fluid levels, and is beneficial for individuals with heart failure or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oral vs injectable: What is the difference&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This name might sound familiar. Before the invention of Rybelsus, semaglutide was only available in an injectable form, widely known under the brand name Ozempic. Now both Rybelsus and Ozempic contain the same active ingredient and work through the same mechanism, but the key difference lies in how they are delivered. For example, injectable GLP-1 delivers the medication directly into the bloodstream, which allows for more efficient absorption and typically fewer gastrointestinal side effects. The oral version, however, passes through the digestive tract and the liver, where part of the medication is broken down, even before it enters the bloodstream. Because of this, rybelsus requires a higher dosage to achieve similar effects to the injectable format. It has been reported that some users may experience more stomach-related side effects, such as nausea, bloating, or decreased appetite, especially when the initial treatment begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why did this approval matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s decision to approve Rybelsus for cardiovascular health marks a turning point in how heart disease may be managed in the future. Traditionally, cardiovascular disease treatment has relied on lifestyle changes, cholesterol-lowering drugs (like statins), and blood pressure medications. While these remain essential, GLP-1 medications offer an entirely new approach, one that targets the underlying metabolic and inflammatory processes that contribute to heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognised as the key driver of atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries that leads to heart attacks and strokes. This drug works by reducing systemic inflammation. Rybelsus helps protect the arteries and slow plaque progression, so dual benefits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research behind this decision&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The active trial on Rybelsus, published under the National Library of Medicine, under the title, "Clinical Trial of Rybelsus (Semaglutide) Among Adults With Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)" Clinical trials have shown that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce major cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths. These benefits were first demonstrated in studies involving injectable semaglutide, and subsequent research suggests the oral form, Rybelsus, provides similar outcomes when taken consistently under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential side effects to consider&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Rybelsus offers promising cardiovascular benefits, it’s not without potential downsides. The most common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, particularly when first starting the medication. These effects often lessen over time as the body adjusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral form must be absorbed on an empty stomach. Patients are typically advised to take Rybelsus first thing in the morning with plain water, wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking other medications. There is also evidence that suggests oral semaglutide may lead to slightly higher rates of side effects, as compared to the injectable form, due to the higher dosage required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingJBVV95cUxNd2J6YmU4QjZMbEdBSDZpZGZJX0ZjbmloZ19Sd19nU2tRSUhFbGxzYTRwMFhsMnVjcTB1ZmNodG9xT0lhTmJweEpqVGxuMExpWWpQOWdKcVVjc2YyOUx6ME1VYzllVFA4NGx3NU56U1VsTE1YZWVGZmZISjVPY0p0Rm0zQnMxdWZpdExQWFR3RTVZR0h2N3ZrdkxEeDAzdlY1TnByTlVyQ2s5VVV3LWpSZWtzTTRxR3QwWmFQQU1hd29DS1NzbXBIM0VmeUdqTHpXdjJPdWpMVlZUSjAxelQySk5aOWgtclM0Y2U4RHJhZjdPU2NHUFF4bVJIZ0pvZkNrUy1RTFgzbVlGXzd1eDdDSUVCT25IS0RXU005M0N3</guid></item><item><title>医疗保险覆盖范围的拟议变更威胁到使用用于治疗疼痛的程序- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/31/medicare-coverage-peripheral-nerve-block-procedures/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39751180/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; Americans suffering from chronic pain may soon lose access to evidence-based interventions that have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30612462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;existed&lt;/a&gt; for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looming &lt;a href="https://asra.com/news-publications/asra-updates/blog-landing/asra-updates/2025/10/16/asra-pain-medicine-urges-action-on-proposed-medicare-coverage-limits-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks-and-other-chronic-pain-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; to Medicare coverage threaten access to local anesthetic blockade, or “peripheral nerve block” procedures. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2808074?utm_source=openevidence&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medicare administrative contractors&lt;/a&gt; across the country have &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=40260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; proposed eliminating coverage for these minimally invasive, non-opioid treatment options for chronic pain disorders. If approved, these coverage changes could drive patients back to opioids, exacerbating the overdose epidemic in the United States, and force patients to unnecessarily pursue invasive and expensive surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability in the United States. It is associated with depression, substance use disorders, an economic burden of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40730349/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$722.8 billion in medical costs&lt;/a&gt; annually, and lost productivity. Chronic pain diagnoses are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40730349/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more prevalent&lt;/a&gt; in veterans, women, adults living in poverty, and those residing in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge of balancing the treatment of chronic pain with addressing the opioid overdose epidemic remains one of the preeminent public health challenges in the United States. Guidelines issued by the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Task Force on Chronic Pain Management &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/fulltext/2010/04000/practice_guidelines_for_chronic_pain_management_.11.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; the importance of a multimodal approach to therapy including non-opioid pain medications, physical and psychological therapy, and minimally invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve blocks are minimally invasive procedures that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25794201/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;well-tolerated&lt;/a&gt; by patients. They are considered relatively low-cost interventions, especially when &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35610642/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; with alternatives such as orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia or hospital admissions for severe pain requiring treatment with intravenous opioid medications. These interventions have broad applications for patients living with conditions that cause chronic pain, such as headache disorders and trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition characterized by unpredictable &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1914484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;attacks of facial pain&lt;/a&gt; that are so severe the condition is associated with depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1914484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suicidal ideation&lt;/a&gt;. These patients frequently report immediate pain relief after a peripheral nerve block, with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30119988/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of patients experiencing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31208761" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a greater than 50% reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their pain, which can last several months and allow patients to return to work and childcare responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, peripheral nerve blocks have demonstrated efficacy in both reducing pain during &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39432635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acute migraine attacks&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568309/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;preventing chronic migraines&lt;/a&gt;. Migraine patients who undergo occipital nerve blocks experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568309/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fewer headache days per month&lt;/a&gt;, which may lead to reduced consumption of pain medications (including opioids) and reduced migraine-associated disability. These procedures are also utilized for patients struggling with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38731163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic pelvic pain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40681086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5018589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;complex regional pain syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. If patients experience pain relief from a peripheral block, some undergo the placement of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39565237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;peripheral nerve stimulators&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27051229/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;denervation&lt;/a&gt; procedures that reduce or eliminate the nerve’s ability to transmit pain signals, however diagnostic peripheral nerve blocks must precede these interventions. The symptom relief from these procedures can last from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8436449/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;months&lt;/a&gt; to years.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Yet on Sept. 25, five of 12 Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) in the U.S., representing 24 states, &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=40299&amp;amp;ver=2&amp;amp;stateRegion=all&amp;amp;contractorNumber=all&amp;amp;proposedStatus=all&amp;amp;sortBy=title&amp;amp;bc=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their intention to dramatically restrict Medicare coverage for peripheral nerve blocks. Medicare contractors are private insurers that process claims for Medicare Parts A and B. Acting as intermediaries between the federal government and Americans insured by Medicare, these private entities make over &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144005001638?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;90% of coverage decisions&lt;/a&gt; in the United States by issuing Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). These policies define which procedures and medications are “&lt;a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/social-security-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reasonable and necessary&lt;/a&gt;” for Medicare coverage and influence other government payers and commercial insurance programs. While this change would only affect the 24 states governed by the five MACs initially, other states could follow suit, and private insurers often follow too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed LCDs, chronic pain procedures would be limited to three steroid injections for median nerve pain, two steroid injections for Morton’s neuroma, and radiofrequency neurolysis for trigeminal neuralgia. All other peripheral nerve blocks and denervation procedures would not be covered. Unless the MACs want more Americans to be unable to work, reliant on opioids, and suffering in pain, it’s hard to understand their motivation here. Eliminating peripheral nerve block coverage will not result in meaningful cost savings from these patients, and may lead to more frequent emergency department and clinic visits, increased use of opioids and other pharmacologic interventions, or more time spent on disability, ultimately &lt;a href="https://asipp.org/wp-content/uploads/Comment-Letter-to-MACs-Public-Comment-for-Proposed-LCD-Peripheral-Nerve-Blocks-and-Procedures-for-Chronic-Pain-10.24.2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raising&lt;/a&gt; direct and indirect health care expenditures in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These coverage changes have been met with concern from numerous professional groups including the &lt;a href="https://asra.com/news-publications/asra-updates/blog-landing/asra-updates/2025/10/16/asra-pain-medicine-urges-action-on-proposed-medicare-coverage-limits-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks-and-other-chronic-pain-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://asipp.org/wp-content/uploads/Comment-Letter-to-MACs-Public-Comment-for-Proposed-LCD-Peripheral-Nerve-Blocks-and-Procedures-for-Chronic-Pain-10.24.2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians,&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the LCDs’ extremely restrictive criteria to evaluate the efficacy of peripheral nerve blocks. Medicare administrative contractor websites state that the new policy was developed to “&lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=40260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;incorporate new procedures and literature&lt;/a&gt;.” However, the LCDs &lt;a href="https://asipp.org/wp-content/uploads/Comment-Letter-to-MACs-Public-Comment-for-Proposed-LCD-Peripheral-Nerve-Blocks-and-Procedures-for-Chronic-Pain-10.24.2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exceed&lt;/a&gt; the standards for evidence used in even Cochrane reviews, which are known to reject greater than 90% of available treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis also ignores the ethical challenges of conducting randomized controlled trials, especially for procedures with &lt;a href="https://painmed.org/medicare-releases-proposed-lcd-on-peripheral-nerve-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;decades of clinical use&lt;/a&gt; and established benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the policies &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=40260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; procedures that do not fit the definition of peripheral nerve blocks, stellate ganglion and cervical sympathetic nerve blocks, as well as &lt;a href="https://asipp.org/wp-content/uploads/Comment-Letter-to-MACs-Public-Comment-for-Proposed-LCD-Peripheral-Nerve-Blocks-and-Procedures-for-Chronic-Pain-10.24.2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; irrelevant diagnostic procedure codes, which raises questions about the expertise of those writing the LCDs. Despite directives within the &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-13005/pdf/COMPS-13005.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;21st Century Cures Act of 2016&lt;/a&gt; calling for increased transparency throughout the LCD process, it is difficult to determine the people and associated conflicts of interests involved in the authorship of these documents. Only two of five MACs list a physician on the LCD’s website, and &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=40260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the two is an OB-GYN with no relevant advanced training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians and advocates concerned about the proposed coverage changes should contact their state senate and house of representative healthy policy committees, &lt;a href="https://asra.com/news-publications/asra-updates/blog-landing/asra-updates/2025/10/16/asra-pain-medicine-urges-action-on-proposed-medicare-coverage-limits-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks-and-other-chronic-pain-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; and provide expert opinions at contractor meetings, and share their clinical expertise during public &lt;a href="https://asra.com/news-publications/asra-updates/blog-landing/asra-updates/2025/10/16/asra-pain-medicine-urges-action-on-proposed-medicare-coverage-limits-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks-and-other-chronic-pain-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; periods open now until Nov. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

Um, and I'm doing &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/cardio" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardio"&gt;cardio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://null" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;4 to 6 days a week. I think the biggest challenge people have with exercise is time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is hard exercise better than daily workouts?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to explain, he said, “So, we flip the question. I get asked that question all the time, including from my patients and I always flip it and I say you tell me how much time you can put in this week. Don't make a lifelong commitment. Just tell me this week. Tell me on Sunday how many hours of exercise can you devote this week? Because this week is different than last week and next week. You might be traveling. You might not be traveling. It might be the kids' first day back at school. You might have a parent-teacher night. I don't know what it is. But you you look at your calendar and you say, 'This week I got 90 minutes.' Okay? If you have 90 minutes, this is what it's going to be. If the next week you say, 'I have 3 hours,' this is what it's going to be and it's going to look a little different. And I think that reframing is helpful when it comes to exercise. This is a very important thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A perfect analogy: Save for now and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Attia also used the analogy of saving money to better explain his point. "So, you have to save for retirement if you want to be able to retire comfortably. But in the short term, saving money brings you no pleasure. There is literally no joy that comes from saving money until the day you retire and you've got this lump sum of money. Conversely, with exercise, you're doing it so that you have this thing at the end of the rainbow, which is, hey, when I'm in the last decade of my life, I'm going to be really fit. But you also acrew benefit in the short term. And I think that people who don't exercise just need to be shown that. And the good news is they don't need to exercise a lot to see that benefit. You take an individual who is completely sedentary and you give them three 30 minute workouts a week, in 6 weeks, they are going to feel like a different person."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Inspired by Dr Attia's words?
