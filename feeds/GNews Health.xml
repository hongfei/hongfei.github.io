    &lt;p&gt;Rarely does a single study change the course of gynecological history. But a clinical trial published this year in The New England Journal of Medicine did just that, seeming to close the door on one of the great enigmas of women’s health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is the most common vaginal infection worldwide. If you have a vagina, there’s a 1-in-3 chance you will have BV at some point in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, doctors have known that the bacteria associated with the condition could also be found on the penis. Yet on paper, BV was just a vagina problem — it’s right there in the name, vaginosis. For 50 years, gynecology treated it as if it were solely a women’s issue, with ineffective treatments that left women vulnerable to reinfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Journal study changed that. The researchers followed 150 heterosexual couples in which the female partner had bacterial vaginosis. They treated the women with first-line antibiotics, and half the men with both oral and topical antibiotics. Within three months, they found, the partner treatment worked so well that they had to disband the study so all participants could be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their conclusion: BV could be transmitted via sex, and should be treated like a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For doctors who treat the condition regularly, the study results felt like a vindication. “It’s just so obvious,” said Dr. Sarah Cigna, a gynecologist who runs a sexual health clinic at George Washington University. “It’s not rocket science.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study spread like, well, an STI. In October, the American College of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynecologists advised its more than 60,000 members to begin offering treatment for male partners of patients with persistent BV. In November, California became the first state to recommend that all providers treat male partners. And this month, New York City announced that all its sexual health clinics would now treat male partners as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is going to change practice in a profound way,” said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and a medical consultant for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of STD prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the journal article came out, some doctors have started calling BV a sexually transmitted infection when they talk to patients. Others, like Cigna, are more hesitant, in part because they believe the stigma of an STI still outweighs the stigma of a vagina problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is debate at all shows that the definition of an STI is still in flux, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologically, most conditions classified as STIs defy binary definitions. The word “sexually,” for starters, rarely tells the full story. “When people hear ‘STI,’ they think penis went into vagina and caused infection,” Cigna said, when in reality sex encompasses far more than penile penetration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the category of STIs were a conflict-ridden country, BV would be a town on one of its ever-shifting borders. The condition changes hands depending on the era and the situation, revealing that those borders were largely artificial to begin with — and making some doctors question the limits of this construct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;STI or not? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial vaginosis challenges the conventional definition of an STI in several ways. It isn’t caused by one infecting agent, like chlamydia or gonorrhea. Instead, it is more of an ecosystem shift in the vaginal microbiome, the teeming community of bacteria that patrol the genitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a gemisch of stuff,” said Dr. Caroline Mitchell, a gynecologist and director of the vulvovaginal disorders program at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s not just one thing, it’s a pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, BV can be transmitted through sex, but researchers disagree about whether it always begins that way. Even Dr. Catriona Bradshaw, the lead author of the study and a clinician at the Melbourne sexual health Center at Monash University, is circumspect: “It’s better to think of BV as being sexually transmissible,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know that once you’ve had it, any change in the pH of the vagina can allow BV bacteria to proliferate, said Dr. Lonna Gordon, an adolescent medicine specialist at Nemours Children’s Health in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change could be set off by douching, condoms, smoking, lubricants, toys, an IUD, hormones, semen or a menstrual period. “You just need to have something that disrupts that environment, which could be a bubble bath, wearing a swimsuit too long, yoga pants,” Gordon said. Yes, yoga pants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing all of these exceptions together, BV is forcing researchers to examine a long-overdue question: Is the term STI still clinically useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole conversation maybe needs to change,” said Dr. Supriya Mehta, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies STIs and the genital microbiome. “Like, who cares about an STI? It’s just a cold that happens to be in your vagina or penis, right?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what doctors call BV, the failure to recognize that it spreads sexually has meant that doctors have been deprived of a critical method for eradicating an incredibly widespread condition, with profound consequences for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything for the vagina is behind, always,” Cigna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A feeling of liberation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Cigna fought BV with one hand tied behind her back. Every doctor who treated the condition regularly could see that patients were being reinfected, either by a new partner or the same partner.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;But without clinical guidelines, she could treat a patient who had BV only with antibiotics or, as a last resort, a microbiome-decimating medication known as boric acid. These methods seldom worked over the long term. For more than half of patients, bacterial vaginosis comes back within six months of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a major problem. Besides causing irritation, discharge and an unpleasant smell, the condition can worsen pregnancy outcomes and make it easier to get HIV, herpes or another STI, a burden that falls disproportionately on Black women and other women of color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “cure” often compounds the problem. Many patients are prescribed numerous rounds of antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we currently do for BV is so bad that people are jumping on this bandwagon,” said Mitchell at Mass General. “We’re all desperate for something more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some patients, thinking of BV as an STI is liberating. One of Cigna’s patients, a 29-year-old transgender man who had struggled with chronic BV for nearly a decade, brought the study in to his appointment in April after coming across it on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who asked not to be identified to avoid discrimination by future employers, said he had always chafed at his doctors’ insistence that BV was a vagina problem, “considering that I pretty exclusively got it from sex,” he said. “It just seemed a little bit, like, blamey, to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if BV was sexually transmitted, it meant his partner could be part of the solution. He and Cigna entered the appointment with the same idea: Maybe partner treatment could be an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the study, Cigna was able to recommend that he take boric acid — he had already undergone more than six rounds of antibiotics — while his partner was also treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not a ‘you’ problem, a ‘we’ problem &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most advancements in modern gynecology, the discovery of bacterial vaginosis can be traced back to a male doctor experimenting on his patients without consent. The physician, Dr. Herman Gardner, suspected that BV must be a result of some pathogen being transferred back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1955, Gardner performed an experiment to find out. He transferred vaginal fluid from 15 women who had BV into the vaginas of women who did not have the condition, and he allowed the newly infected women to pass BV on to their unsuspecting husbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon culturing bacteria from some of the husbands, Gardner declared BV to be “the most prevalent and one of the most contagious” of all STIs. For his efforts, Gardner’s name was forever enshrined in the species of bacteria most associated with BV: Gardnerella vaginalis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, a handful of studies have tried to replicate the findings using more ethical practices. All failed, leaving doctors with the impression that BV was not actually a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were hints that those studies were flawed. Researchers knew that recurrence was much higher in women who had a regular sexual partner or who did not use condoms. They also knew that the vaginal microbiomes of women who were partners with women resembled each other under the microscope; if one had BV, the other probably did, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So why wouldn’t it be transmitted between penises and vaginas?” Bradshaw asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She attributed the failure of past studies to paltry funding, shoddy research design and the challenge of getting men to commit to studies that do not benefit them personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Bradshaw was listed as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in health for “reframing a ‘women’s issue’” as a public health issue. No longer was BV a shameful, secret “vagina problem.” Now it was a problem shared between members of a sexual partnership. Not a “you” problem, but a “we” problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some people seem to defy the aging process entirely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a trail race last month, chatting with a woman I assumed was in her early thirties. We talked about training schedules, favorite routes, the usual runner stuff. Then she mentioned celebrating her 55th birthday the week before. I nearly choked on my water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens more often than you'd think. And after years of observing these ageless wonders, both on the trails and in everyday life, I've noticed they all seem to dodge certain habits that the rest of us fall into without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: looking younger isn't just about good genes or expensive skincare. The people who genuinely appear decades younger than their chronological age? They've figured out that what you don't do matters just as much as what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share the six common habits these age-defying folks consistently avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Sitting for hours without moving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that woman from the trail race? When I asked about her secret, she laughed and said, "I treat sitting like smoking. Small doses only."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a point. Those who look significantly younger rarely plant themselves in one spot for hours on end. They're the ones taking walking meetings, using standing desks, or doing what I call "movement snacks" throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I worked as a financial analyst, I'd sit for eight, sometimes ten hours straight, only getting up for bathroom breaks. My body felt decades older than it should have. These days, I set a timer every hour. Sometimes I do ten squats, sometimes I walk around the block. Nothing dramatic, just enough to keep things flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research backs this up too. Extended sitting accelerates cellular aging and affects everything from your posture to your skin's elasticity. Those who look younger? They've figured out that movement isn't just exercise. It's a lifestyle choice that happens all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Constantly stressing about things they can't control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that person who always looks haggard and worn down? Usually they're the ones losing sleep over news headlines, obsessing about other people's opinions, or spiraling about hypothetical disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age-defying crowd? They've mastered the art of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a world-class worrier. At 36, I hit a wall so hard that therapy became non-negotiable. My therapist introduced me to this radical concept: if you can't directly influence something within the next 24 hours, it doesn't deserve your mental energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple, right? But watch someone who looks twenty years younger than their age. They'll express concern about important issues, sure, but they don't carry that tension in their shoulders or wear it on their face. They've learned that chronic stress literally ages you at a cellular level, affecting everything from your telomeres to your collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks have boundaries with their worry. They stay informed without becoming consumed. They care without carrying the weight of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Eating processed foods as their main fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look decades younger? Their shopping carts tell a different story than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not necessarily following the latest fad diet or counting every calorie. But walk through a grocery store with them, and you'll notice most of their food doesn't come in packages with ingredient lists longer than a CVS receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I switched to a plant-based diet, something interesting happened beyond the expected energy boost. My skin changed. Not overnight, but gradually, people started asking what I was doing differently. Was it a new moisturizer? Had I started getting facials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Just real food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who age slowly treat food as information for their cells. They understand that what you eat literally becomes you. Your skin cells, your brain cells, everything regenerates using the materials you provide. Feed your body preservatives, artificial colors, and mysterious chemicals? Don't be surprised when you start looking preserved yourself, and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Skimping on sleep to be "productive"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know the quickest way to add years to your appearance? Pull a few all-nighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ageless ones? They guard their sleep like a precious resource. Because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 5:30 AM to hit the trails, which means I'm in bed by 9:30 PM most nights. Friends used to tease me about my "grandma bedtime." But here's what they don't see: while they're scrolling through their phones at midnight, their bodies are missing out on crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is when your body produces growth hormone, repairs damaged cells, and consolidates memories. Those who consistently get seven to nine hours don't just look younger. They think clearer, move better, and handle stress like champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "I'll sleep when I'm dead" crowd? They're aging themselves into an early grave, one late night at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Avoiding discomfort at all costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something counterintuitive: the people who look youngest are often the ones who regularly choose discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold showers. Challenging workouts. Learning new skills that make them feel like beginners. They seek out experiences that push them beyond their comfort zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started trail running at 28, I was terrible at it. Gasping for air, tripping over roots, getting passed by people twice my age. The analytical part of my brain screamed at me to quit and find something I was naturally good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something magical happens when you regularly challenge yourself. Your body and mind stay adaptive. You maintain what researchers call "cognitive flexibility." You literally signal to your cells that you're still growing, still evolving, still vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comfort-seekers? They're slowly fossilizing, one easy choice at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Living in the past or future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final habit that ages people prematurely? Time travel. Not the sci-fi kind, but the mental kind where you're constantly reliving past glories or mistakes, or anxiously planning for a future that may never come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who look decades younger have an almost Buddhist approach to time. They're present. Really present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think meditation was too "woo-woo" for my analytical mind. Then I tried it out of desperation during my burnout recovery. What I discovered wasn't mystical at all. It was practical. When you're fully engaged with the moment you're in, you're not wearing yourself down with regret or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone who looks far younger than their years. They listen when you talk. They taste their food. They notice the sunrise. They're not checking their phone every three minutes or mentally rehearsing tomorrow's meeting during dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presence shows up in their appearance. Their faces aren't etched with worry lines from future fears or frown lines from past resentments. They age in real-time, not accelerated by mental time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking younger than your age isn't about finding the fountain of youth or spending thousands on treatments. It's about what you choose not to do every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habits that age us fastest are often the ones we don't even realize we have. They're the default settings of modern life: sitting too much, stressing constantly, eating convenience foods, sacrificing sleep, avoiding challenges, and living anywhere but the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking these patterns isn't always easy. Some mornings, I still want to skip my run and scroll through my phone instead. Sometimes I catch myself spiraling about things beyond my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I've learned from those ageless individuals I meet on the trails and in life: youth isn't just about how many years you've lived. It's about how much life you put into those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking just one habit to avoid. Notice how it makes you feel. Then maybe add another. Small changes compound over time, just like aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is yours. You can follow the default path and age according to schedule. Or you can join the rebels who refuse to act (or look) their age.&lt;/p&gt;

There were over 3,600 flu hospitalizations recorded in the state during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Public Health also recorded "high" flu activity. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-season-massachusetts-vaccine/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Boston announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a 114% increase in recent flu cases, with children seeing the biggest increase in cases. Meanwhile, a spike in cases prompted a Minnesota school to shift to online learning before Christmas. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-flu-season-schools-hospitalizations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS News Minnesota reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the state had seen 113 flu-related hospitalizations in 2025, more than double the number recorded last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have expressed concern about this year's flu season. A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly. The CDC reported that of 2,086 specimens that tested positive for flu between Dec. 13 and Dec. 20, 2,029 of them had influenza A. When 1,627 of those specimens were subtyped, 1,493, or nearly 92%, were found to be H3N2.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-2025-experts-pretty-worried/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize the illness. The strain is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer people have also gotten &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this year. About 130 million doses of the flu vaccine have been administered nationwide, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that while experts are expecting a "H3N2 mismatch," the vaccine's "match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good." Meanwhile, early season data from the United Kingdom suggests that the vaccines are still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do," Bloom said. "It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk."&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 22:46:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQcFVsT2JnYXdVMEk2Zk51cFdnVldjQnpla25KZmFLRG9UYzh2VkJVSHZQOFFROUJKcm9TaGluYkFXVnpwbXllUk4xSi1jSDlHWXNKU3JlU2tlRnZyT3hOOEtybVBXSlpJR2ZFYzBTd05PSGxBSlBJYTEybzU4ZkZheHZ5Rk9UVnFqRUNCbnJJSVBUbkE</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州更多的麻疹危及美国的消除地位- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-south-carolina-us-elimination-status-rcna251515</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dc7ffd" class="body-graf"&gt;A sizable uptick in measles cases in the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreaks-no-end-2025-cases-mount-utah-arizona-south-carolina-rcna249743" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing outbreak in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; has put the U.S. on the precipice of losing its elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-880dfd" class="body-graf"&gt;South Carolina’s health department on Tuesday reported 20 new measles cases since Friday, bringing the state’s total this year to 179. That tally is higher than the number of measles cases recorded for the entire U.S. in six of the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76b40a" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;country has counted&lt;/a&gt; over 2,000 measles cases, 93% of which were among unvaccinated people or those with an unknown vaccination status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's by far the most since the disease was first considered eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3b6e" class="body-graf"&gt;Measles is considered eliminated in a country once it no longer spreads constantly for a full year. In the U.S., that deadline is fast approaching: Transmission of the highly contagious disease has been sustained since around Jan. 20. Unless that trend comes to an abrupt halt in the next three weeks — which is highly unlikely — the country could lose its elimination status, as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" target="_blank"&gt;Canada did in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-808d32" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said at a press briefing on Tuesday that measles transmission is ongoing in households, schools and churches there, and that 287 people are being quarantined to help limit the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fccccf" class="body-graf"&gt;“We do anticipate more cases well into January,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55a019" class="body-graf"&gt;All but three of South Carolina's measles cases this year have been linked to an outbreak in Spartanburg County, in the northwestern part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3744aa" class="body-graf"&gt;The vast majority of cases have been in unvaccinated people, most of whom are children between 5 and 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a2afb" class="body-graf"&gt;“We do believe that the holidays contributed to this,” Bell said, referring to measles transmission at family gatherings and during travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2155f" class="body-graf"&gt;At least three people in South Carolina have been hospitalized with measles complications, according to the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e6f21" class="body-graf"&gt;The surge in U.S. measles cases this year is mostly attributable to a decline in childhood vaccination rates and a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/childhood-vaccine-exemption-rates-hit-record-high-cdc-data-shows-rcna222338" target="_blank"&gt;rise in vaccine exemptions&lt;/a&gt;. Less than 93% of kindergartners received two doses of the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;for the 2024-25 school year&lt;/a&gt; compared with 95% for the 2019-2020 school year. A vaccination rate of at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;95% is needed&lt;/a&gt; to curb the virus’ spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa1343" class="body-graf"&gt;A large measles &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; this year accounted for a substantial share of the U.S. total — around 760 cases linked to the outbreak were recorded from January to August. It was centered in Gaines County, where kindergartners had a 77% measles vaccination rate as of the 2024-25 school year. Some affected families &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;chose unproven remedies&lt;/a&gt; like vitamins and cod-liver oil instead of measles shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c25c95" class="body-graf"&gt;Two unvaccinated school-age children in Lubbock, Texas, died of measles, as did an unvaccinated adult across the border in New Mexico who did not seek medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4efa3" class="body-graf"&gt;Before this year, the U.S. had not seen a measles death in roughly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b99c5" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to the current outbreak in South Carolina, measles cases are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreaks-no-end-2025-cases-mount-utah-arizona-south-carolina-rcna249743" target="_blank"&gt;simmering in Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; as part of an outbreak that began in late summer. And in just the last week, Washoe County, Nevada, saw its first measles case since 2018. Health officials have also warned of possible exposures to measles at Newark Liberty International Airport, Boston Logan Airport and Denver International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4b2b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Many public health experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;expressed concern about the federal messaging&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took office in February. Though Kennedy has called for people to get the MMR shot, he has also framed vaccination as a personal choice, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; such as steroids and antibiotics, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;falsely claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb01ca" class="body-graf"&gt;Common measles symptoms include a blotchy rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, pink or watery eyes and white spots on the insides of the cheeks.

That tally is higher than the number of measles cases recorded for the entire U.S. in six of the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76b40a" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;country has counted&lt;/a&gt; over 2,000 measles cases, 93% of which were among unvaccinated people or those with an unknown vaccination status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's by far the most since the disease was first considered eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3b6e" class="body-graf"&gt;Measles is considered eliminated in a country once it no longer spreads constantly for a full year. In the U.S., that deadline is fast approaching: Transmission of the highly contagious disease has been sustained since around Jan. 20. Unless that trend comes to an abrupt halt in the next three weeks — which is highly unlikely — the country could lose its elimination status, as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" target="_blank"&gt;Canada did in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-808d32" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said at a press briefing on Tuesday that measles transmission is ongoing in households, schools and churches there, and that 287 people are being quarantined to help limit the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fccccf" class="body-graf"&gt;“We do anticipate more cases well into January,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55a019" class="body-graf"&gt;All but three of South Carolina's measles cases this year have been linked to an outbreak in Spartanburg County, in the northwestern part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3744aa" class="body-graf"&gt;The vast majority of cases have been in unvaccinated people, most of whom are children between 5 and 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a2afb" class="body-graf"&gt;“We do believe that the holidays contributed to this,” Bell said, referring to measles transmission at family gatherings and during travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2155f" class="body-graf"&gt;At least three people in South Carolina have been hospitalized with measles complications, according to the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e6f21" class="body-graf"&gt;The surge in U.S. measles cases this year is mostly attributable to a decline in childhood vaccination rates and a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/childhood-vaccine-exemption-rates-hit-record-high-cdc-data-shows-rcna222338" target="_blank"&gt;rise in vaccine exemptions&lt;/a&gt;. Less than 93% of kindergartners received two doses of the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;for the 2024-25 school year&lt;/a&gt; compared with 95% for the 2019-2020 school year. A vaccination rate of at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;95% is needed&lt;/a&gt; to curb the virus’ spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa1343" class="body-graf"&gt;A large measles &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; this year accounted for a substantial share of the U.S. total — around 760 cases linked to the outbreak were recorded from January to August. It was centered in Gaines County, where kindergartners had a 77% measles vaccination rate as of the 2024-25 school year. Some affected families &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;chose unproven remedies&lt;/a&gt; like vitamins and cod-liver oil instead of measles shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c25c95" class="body-graf"&gt;Two unvaccinated school-age children in Lubbock, Texas, died of measles, as did an unvaccinated adult across the border in New Mexico who did not seek medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4efa3" class="body-graf"&gt;Before this year, the U.S. had not seen a measles death in roughly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b99c5" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to the current outbreak in South Carolina, measles cases are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreaks-no-end-2025-cases-mount-utah-arizona-south-carolina-rcna249743" target="_blank"&gt;simmering in Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; as part of an outbreak that began in late summer. And in just the last week, Washoe County, Nevada, saw its first measles case since 2018. Health officials have also warned of possible exposures to measles at Newark Liberty International Airport, Boston Logan Airport and Denver International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4b2b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Many public health experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;expressed concern about the federal messaging&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took office in February. Though Kennedy has called for people to get the MMR shot, he has also framed vaccination as a personal choice, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; such as steroids and antibiotics, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;falsely claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb01ca" class="body-graf"&gt;Common measles symptoms include a blotchy rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, pink or watery eyes and white spots on the insides of the cheeks. Severe cases can progress to pneumonia or swelling of the brain. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left.

                There have been at least 7,500,00 illnesses and 3,100 deaths from flu this season, according to CDC data. And flu cases are expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Flu season is off to a rough start this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the virus arrived as expected, cases are rising faster, compared with previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last week, more than 19,000 patients with influenza were admitted to hospitals, up about 10,000 from the previous week, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" target="_blank"&gt;new CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. To date, the CDC estimates at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and over 3,100 people have died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The surge seems to be driven primarily by a new strain of the virus — subclade K of influenza A(H3N2) — that emerged in Australia over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Anywhere we detect this virus, you can see a large surge of influenza cases coming afterwards," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1972/andrew-stanley-pekosz" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Pekosz&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In the U.S., "the timing is not that much different from other flu seasons, but the number of cases, and how quickly those cases are increasing is something that is not usually seen this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New York has been hit especially hard, with state health officials announcing over 71,000 cases last week — the most cases ever recorded in a single week in the state. But other states are seeing high levels of flu activity, particularly in the northeast, midwest and south.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The map is mostly red," says Pekosz, indicating high levels of disease that will likely increase over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When you're in the middle of seeing the curve start to go up, we just don't have any sense of where it's going to stop," he says. "That's the big concern in most of the medical communities right now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What's driving the upswing?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, there's no indication that this new strain is more severe, or even more contagious than previous years, says &lt;a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/krammerlab/dr-krammer/" target="_blank"&gt;Florian Krammer&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there have been changes to the virus that may allow it to get around our immune defenses, he says. "There's less immunity to it, and that's allowing the virus to spread very quickly and extensively."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are some concerns that this season's flu vaccine&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/11/07/g-s1-96655/flu-vaccine-covid-virus" target="_blank"&gt; may not be a perfect match&lt;/a&gt; to the new strain, given it emerged after the formulation was decided last February. "I think we're going to have a mismatch between the strain circulating and the vaccine," says Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC until he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;resigned in August.&lt;/a&gt; "But the vaccine is still the best protection we have, even if it's imperfect protection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from the United Kingdom, which saw an early surge of flu this year, suggests the vaccine is about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;30 to 40% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing hospitalization in adults. "Those numbers are in line with what you would typically see," says Krammer, though he stresses those are preliminary estimates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to respond to the surge&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines only offer protection if people get them and in the U.S., only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;42% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a flu shot this year. That leaves many people unprotected in face of a likely bad flu season, says Daskalakis. He'd like to see the CDC do more to encourage vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You're not seeing the robust communication that you would expect," he says. "Usually you'd expect to see more alerts coming out of CDC, more recommendations to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In response to that criticism, a CDC spokesperson said, "the CDC is strongly committed to keeping Americans healthy during flu season. CDC launched a new national outreach campaign designed to raise awareness and empower Americans with the tools they need to stay healthy during the respiratory illness season," adding "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one. People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; In an interview with NPR, Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer in the CDC's influenza division emphasized the importance of vaccination. "It's definitely not too late to get a flu vaccine if you haven't done it already," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are other ways of protecting yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're using public transportation, if you're in the room with a lot of other people, if you're in a healthcare setting, it's really smart to wear a mask," says Krammer, especially higher-quality masks. "I was taking the subway yesterday in New York City. I was wearing an N95 mask."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Social distancing, especially when you or someone in your household is infected, can help minimize the spread too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you get infected, there are effective treatment options, especially when started with 48 hours of infection. "If you get an infection with influenza, that's really a reason to see a physician, get diagnosed, and then take next steps," says Krammer. "It's not an infection that you should take lightly."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A deadly, drug-resistant fungus is extending its tendrils around the world. Research out this month finds that the public health threat of &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; has steadily climbed over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed the scientific literature on &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt;, which was only discovered in 2009. Since then, outbreaks of the fungus have been reported across the globe, including in the U.S. The infection is often mistaken for other germs and is hard to treat with existing drugs, the researchers add, further raising its danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Taken together, these data underscore the need to develop novel antifungal agents with broad-spectrum activity against human fungal pathogens, to improve diagnostic tests, and to develop immune- and vaccine-based adjunct modalities for the treatment of high-risk patients,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mmbr.00187-22"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The rising fungal menace&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fungal infections have become a growing threat to humanity. A study last year, for instance, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deaths-fungal-infections-deadly-resistant-fungi-climate-1851169272"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that fungi plays a role in killing nearly 4 million people annually, almost double the amount estimated a decade ago. But &lt;em&gt;C. auris—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33091071/"&gt;first discovered&lt;/a&gt; inside a person’s ear by doctors in Japan in 2009—might be one of the scarier fungi around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; can colonize our skin without causing any problems. But sometimes, especially in people with weakened immune systems, it will cause a serious, widespread infection that quickly turns life-threatening. About one-third of people hospitalized with &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; will die from it, research has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/7/23-0540_article"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;, while the mortality rate for bloodstream infections can reach nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One major reason why &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; is so dangerous is that, compared to other disease-causing &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;species, it’s uniquely adept at resisting many of the most common medications used to treat fungal infections. There have even been recorded cases of pan-resistant &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt;: strains that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35770999/"&gt;resist&lt;/a&gt; all four major classes of antifungals. To make things worse, conventional tests will regularly misidentify &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; as other &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; species, which can then lead to delayed or incorrect treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; is still a relatively rare source of fungal illness, but its global burden has clearly been increasing over time, the study researchers note. It’s now been documented in over 50 countries. In the U.S., &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in at least 39 states, with more than 4,500 cases in 2023 (the last year with available data).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more existentially frightening level, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; might be one of the first emerging diseases directly caused by climate change, the researchers say. Evidence &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deadly-super-yeast-found-in-the-wild-for-the-first-time-1846485781"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the fungus only started regularly sickening humans after it adapted to increasingly warmer temperatures&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;the same sort of temperatures found in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Not all hope is lost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dire as the outlook might seem, there are still reasons for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that scientists are working on new antifungals, and several promising drugs have recently reached the public or are far along in development. In 2023, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/fda-approves-antifungal-rezafungin-to-treat-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Rezafungin for invasive &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections. There’s also been some progress on vaccines, some of which could provide protection against a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-science-fair-a-vaccine-to-treat-a-wide-variety-of-fungal-infections-2000648401"&gt;wide range of fungal pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t just highlighting what we’ve learned so far about &lt;em&gt;C. auris; &lt;/em&gt;they’re hoping to make the discoveries that will help us fend off these dangerous germs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“My laboratory investigates how fungal pathogens interact with the host to drive infection, with the goal of uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable these organisms to cause disease,” study author Neeraj Chauhan, a professor at the Center for Discovery and Innovation at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told Gizmodo. “The long-term goal of research is to guide the development of new strategies for diagnosing, preventing, and treating drug-resistant fungal infections.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, scientists like Chauhan will find the weaknesses of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; long before we end up reenacting &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/last-of-us-fungus-climate-change-health-1850061831"&gt;fungal nightmare scenarios&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                A health worker administers the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to a student in Islamabad, Pakistan on Sept. 24. The vaccine protects against cervical cancer. This year, a new one-dose strategy gained greater acceptance in Pakistan and other countries. Previously, the standard was three doses but years of testing have established that one dose is highly effective for younger girls and older girls can get the benefit from two doses.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Has there been any good news on the global health front in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The year has been dominated by the unprecedented shakeup of U.S. aid, with the dissolving of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and dramatic cuts and freezes. These changes in the aid budget had a devastating impact on programs that fight disease, provide free health care and focus on maternal and child health. Other countries reset priorities and cut global health funding as well, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The turmoil of this year raises deep concerns about the year ahead, with different perspectives on the impact of the Trump shakeup. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's been a brutal year," says &lt;a href="https://atulgawande.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Atul Gawande, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;former head of global health at USAID and a professor at Harvard Medical School. "We're now closing in on &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/USAID-cuts-global-impact-14-million-deaths#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,4.5%20million%20children%20under%205." target="_blank"&gt;700,000 people who are estimated to have died&lt;/a&gt; by any conservative measure as a result of USAID's shutdown. [We now expect] the first increase in in child mortality since the 1960s. It's a setback of staggering proportions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott responded to these characterizations by email, calling them "false conclusions" based on "inaccurate assumption" and pointing to "the groundbreaking global health strategy being implemented at the State Department ... fundamentally changing how the United States delivers assistance by helping governments build stable, self-sustaining health care systems within their own countries."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet amid the debate about the future of global health programs, there was consensus: It was year that saw notable progress. "There have been important successes," says Dr. Kate O'Brien of the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the high points in global health in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A triple crown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No country has met the goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B — until this year. In October, the World Health Organization validated the Maldives for the hepatitis B part of this trifecta. In 2019, the South Asian island nation had been recognized for ending maternal transmission of the other two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-maldives-becomes-the-first-country-to-achieve-triple-elimination-of-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-syphilis-and-hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; in a statement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;[Note: Elimination means reducing mother-to-baby transmission below a specific threshold for each disease – for example, an infection rate of less than 1% for hepatitis B Dr. Catharina Boehme of WHO's southeast Asia office, credited the "unwavering commitment toward universal health coverage" to all, "including migrants," as a key element in this achievement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another record-breaking elimination &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just under the wire for a 2025 designation, in mid-December Brazil was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-12-2025-who-validates-brazil-for-eliminating-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;validated by WHO for quashing transmission of HIV between mothers and children.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It's the largest country in the Americas to do so.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've been in this work for 25 years and to think how far we've come — I really feel I've been part of witnessing one of the greatest public health achievements of the last 50 years," Anurita Bains tells NPR. The UNICEF associate director for HIV/AIDS, she was in Brazil for the announcement, marked by a celebration whose guests included the country's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress in the fight to beat malaria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/30-06-2025-suriname-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suriname,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-07-2025-timor-leste-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Timor-Leste&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the nation of&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/23-01-2025-georgia-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were all certified by WHO as malaria-free in 2025. Suriname gets extra praise as the first country in the Amazon — with its mosquito-friendly forests — to eliminate the disease. The certification means no locally acquired cases of malaria in the certified country for three years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1515/jane-m-carlton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jane Carlton,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; director of the Malaria Research Institute at Johns Hopkins University, credits much of the malaria success to community health workers dispatched to diagnose and treat foreign workers in Suriname's gold mining areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are now 47 countries and one territory that are malaria-free. Yet this ancient virus still takes a tremendous toll, with 82 million cases and 610,000 deaths in 2024, and there are concerns of losing progress because of climate change that enables mosquitoes to thrive in new geographic areas, drug resistance and reduced funding for community health workers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But there's encouragement from a new weapon in the arsenal: In 2025, seven countries introduced the recently approved malaria vaccine: Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia, bringing the total to 24,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; according to WHO.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A nearly bulletproof anti-HIV drug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir, a drug injected twice a year to prevent HIV, was both approved in the U.S.&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; and recommended by WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. In clinical trials,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7435a1.htm#:~:text=In%20June%202025%2C%20FDA%20approved,follow%2Dup%20of%2052%20weeks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; the drug was 100% effective in preventing HIV in women and 96% effective in men – and there's no issue of stigma as there can be with the daily pills many now take to meet this goal.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/11/driving-global-health-progress-through-american-innovation-and-burden-sharing-the-first-doses-of-lenacapavir-arrive-in-eswatini-and-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/11/driving-global-health-progress-through-american-innovation-and-burden-sharing-the-first-doses-of-lenacapavir-arrive-in-eswatini-and-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; a partnership between the U.S. Department of State and the Global Fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; began delivering the first shipments of what will be a total of 4 million doses for 2 million people in low- and middle-income countries. Eswatini and Zambia are the two countries to receive doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anurita Bains of UNICEF calls lenacapavir "a game changer that is going to be transformative … especially for women who may not want [to tell] or can't tell partners or relatives that they are taking the medication."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was additional good news about lenacapavir in 2025. The U.S. manufacturer Gilead Sciences announced it will allow generic manufacturing of the drug in low- and middle-income countries, with funding from philanthropies including the Gates Foundation, which is a financial supporter of this blog and of NPR, and the Clinton Health Initiative. The generic version is expected to debut in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2025/2025-07-09-global-fund-secures-access-breakthrough-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a statement, the Global Fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria said "this marks the first time in history that an HIV prevention product will be introduced in [low- and middle-income countries] at the same time as in high-income countries — a significant milestone for global health equity."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the road ahead is uncharted for U.S. health aid abroad, Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of the Global and Public Health Policy Program at the health research group KFF, told NPR that the 4 million doses of lenacapavir being sent by the U.S. State Department and the Global Fund "is seen as a really important development that the original agreement was made under the Biden administration is now being honored by the Trump Administration." &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the lead out in Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/media/12191/file/MICS%20Preliminary%20findings%202025.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A government survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh published in 2025 found a likely decline in blood lead levels in children in the country&lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/cautious-signs-progress-lead-exposure-bangladesh-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; and a definite decline of 10 percentage points among children in the capital Dhaka region.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Lead exposure can come from paints, batteries and dyes like lead chromate sprinkled on turmeric to enhance its color. One in three children in the country are affected; the consequences can include developmental delays and neurologic deficits as well as kidney and cardiovascular problems later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/expert/rachel-bonnifield" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rachel Bonnifield,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; director of the global health policy program at the Center for Global Development points to education efforts by the Bangladeshi government such as warnings about sprinkling lead-based dyes on spices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for future efforts was affected when funding from USAID, "who had been one of the major proponents, felloff," says Bonnifield, but she is encouraged by new initiatives announced in 2025 by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/public-health/reducing-lead-poisoning/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to support lead prevention projects in Asia, Africa and South America.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more accessible HPV vaccine protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First approved in 2006, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8225515/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been hailed as an effective way to prevent girls from developing cervical cancer. But there's an obstacle to its success: The original regimen called for three doses. That has presented a financial burden to lower-resource countries purchasing the vaccine and a logistical burden for parents who'd have to bring their children in three times — a challenge in parts of the world where clinics are not easily accessible. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, however, a new strategy to overcome this issue gained greater acceptance. Years of testing have established that one dose is highly effective for younger girls and older girls can get the benefit from two doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, the one-dose strategy was endorsed by 11 countries: Angola, Benin, Cuba, Djibouti, Ghana, Madagascar, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Tunisia. And Belarus, Oman and China added the vaccine at two doses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"HPV vaccination, which has reached less than 20% of the world, is our biggest opportunity for preventing cervical cancer," says &lt;a href="https://atulgawande.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Atul Gawande, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;formerly of USAID. "For every 70 girls who are vaccinated in low-income countries, you will save one life from cervical cancer. It is an extraordinary impact that has now reached 86 million girls and can be advanced considerably."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A six-in-one vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In higher income countries, a hexavalent vaccine, which covers six diseases, has been available for the past 20 years. In July the hexavalent (six disease) vaccine was launched in low-income countries for the first time: Mauritania and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine protects against diphtheria, hepatitis B, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type B and polio. Mauritania and Senegal had previously used a five in one vaccine and separate vaccines for polio. The addition of polio cuts the number of shots kids get – and parents have to get them to. A statement from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which is a leader in the effort to get vaccines to kids in lower resource settings, notes that adding one new virus to the vaccine's count can make a significant difference in protecting children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In November, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-launches-agari-a-continent-wide-genomic-data-platform-to-strengthen-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Africa Genome Archiving for Response and Insight,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an online platform that will allow researchers across the continent to share genetic data on disease-causing pathogens of concern. They'll be reporting on, including familiar culprits like HIV and malaria as well as newfound threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Africa developing genomic expertise and capacity will increase the continent's ability to quickly identify, characterize and respond to infectious disease outbreaks," says&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins. That capacity will result in "less damage and disruption" in any future global pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fran Kritz is a health policy reporter based in Washington, D.C., and a regular contributor to NPR.

At 45 years old, after multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and miscarriages, and thinking she was finally “in the clear,” the fetal heartbeat had stopped in the second trimester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of her lament she uttered over and over again: “Why did I wait so long? Why did I wait so long?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve been a maternal-fetal medicine doctor for more than two decades, and, unfortunately, I’m used to working with patients who are going through these sort of unimaginable losses.

It can survive on surfaces for long periods of time before spreading to patients through catheters, breathing tubes or IVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some strains of the fungus are considered a superbug because they’re resistant to all types of antibiotics usually used to treat fungal infections.

You’re all on your own,” Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, told &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/what-makes-candida-auris-so-dangerous/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nexstar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nexstar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fungus’ drug resistance has made it especially hard to contain.

Data was missing for two states: Alabama and Florida.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some scientists theorize climate change is contributing to the spread of Candida auris and pathogens like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Historically, fungi have had a hard time surviving at our bodies’ warm body temperature, microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dangerous-fungus-climate-change-new-york-c1b5ab8f4232a5f2320929dae3b80200" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told the Associated Press;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told the Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. But as the climate warms, the fungi are adapting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have tremendous protection against environmental fungi because of our temperature. However, if the world is getting warmer and the fungi begin to adapt to higher temperatures as well, some … are going to reach what I call the temperature barrier,” where they’ll be able to survive in the human body, Casadevall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/candida-auris-study-reveals-most-132300100.html" data-ylk="slk:Candida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt; Candida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the past, the CDC estimated that “based on information from a limited number of patients, 30–60% of people with C. auris infections have died.

Every year, an estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17703-norovirus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;684 million&lt;/a&gt; people globally come down with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is a kind of infectious gastroenteritis, “an inflammation of the bowel and the colon that can cause diarrhea” and vomiting, explains Dr Ambreen Allana, an infectious disease physician based in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus can spread year-round, but has earned the nickname “winter vomiting illness” because it peaks from December to February in the northern hemisphere, says Dr Laraine Washer, medical director of infection prevention and epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-norovirus-spread" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does norovirus spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is highly contagious. The virus typically enters the gastrointestinal tract via tiny viral particles from an infected person’s saliva or feces. These particles may end up on your hands, or in food or drink, and ultimately in your mouth – “what we call the fecal-oral route”, Washer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Particles remain infectious for up to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-do-norovirus-germs-live-on-household-and-office-surfaces" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; on hard surfaces like doorknobs and bathroom fixtures, and it takes very little exposure to make you sick. “The infectious dose of noroviruses is less than 20 virus particles,” says Washer. (Covid-19, by contrast, needs an exposure of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20503121221115053" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;100-400&lt;/a&gt; virus particles to infect.) “When somebody has an active norovirus infection, there’s billions of virus particles per gram of stool,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also some risk of transmission via aerosolized particles, particularly if you’re around someone while they are experiencing symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus becomes contagious about two days prior to the onset of symptoms, and people can remain contagious for days or even weeks after they’re feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Close quarters such as eldercare facilities, daycares and airports are a “perfect nidus for catching infection”, says Allana. Cruise ships are particularly notorious: the CDC has reported 16 norovirus outbreaks on ships stopping in US ports in 2025 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The onset of norovirus symptoms can feel sudden, starting with abdominal cramping, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting and “very watery diarrhea”, says Washer. Most cases are “mild” in the medical sense, meaning they resolve within three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, it’s an extremely unpleasant illness. “People can feel pretty wiped out, fatigued; they may have a low-grade fever, headache. And in most cases, individuals are not able to continue doing their normal activities,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-i-need-medical-care-for-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need medical care for norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each year, norovirus causes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;570-800&lt;/a&gt; deaths and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/ciu120" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;70,000&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations in the US, with people over 65 at greatest risk. Those most likely to have severe norovirus are “children less than five years of age, and especially older individuals and those who are immunocompromised”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those in higher-risk age categories are also particularly susceptible to kidney injury due to dehydration from excessive diarrhea, says Allana. If you or a family member is in a higher-risk age category and unable to keep down liquids, Allana recommends seeing your doctor or going to your local emergency department to receive IV fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most adults and older children without underlying conditions recover from norovirus without medical intervention. While the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/outbreak-basics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 2,500 norovirus outbreaks annually in the United States, the actual number of infections is closer to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/#:~:text=19%E2%80%9321%20million%20total%20illnesses%20per%20year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;21m&lt;/a&gt; – most cases go unreported because people can “deal with their infections at home”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there’s nothing you can do to shorten the duration of a bout of norovirus, it’s important to stay hydrated throughout. “Try drinking the same amount of Gatorade or water as the volume that comes out,” says Allana. “Ice chips, ice lollies – really anything you can keep down that will keep you hydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An antiemetic – medication that prevents nausea and vomiting – like Dramamine may be necessary if you can’t keep liquids down. Do not, however, take medicines that stop diarrhea, like Imodium or Pepto-Bismol, says Washer. “Our body is trying to get rid of the infection, and if we keep the viruses inside … they stick around for longer periods of time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":19,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-avoid-getting-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you avoid getting norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We don’t have a norovirus vaccine yet. That’s because norovirus is “incredibly difficult” to grow and study in labs, says Dr Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist who has &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/its-the-most-violently-ill-time-of" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about norovirus on her Substack. The virus has many different strains, which mutate frequently, making broad protection challenging, Love explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That leaves the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wash your hands: &lt;/strong&gt;“To prevent or control outbreaks, good handwashing is important for everyone,” advises a representative from the CDC via email. “Importantly, infected individuals should not prepare or handle food, or care for others when they are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hand sanitizer and other alcohol-based disinfectants do not work against norovirus, because of how the virus is structured. “You can use hand sanitizers in addition to handwashing, but hand sanitizer alone does not work well against norovirus and is not a substitute for handwashing,” according to the CDC spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, with good-quality soap, for at least 20 seconds, says Allana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid using an infected person’s bathroom: &lt;/strong&gt;If possible, designate a separate bathroom for the sick person in your household until they recover, and limit other contact, Washer suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean affected items: &lt;/strong&gt;Clean surfaces with diluted bleach (1 cup per gallon of water) or undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide, both of which can kill norovirus. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning a bathroom where someone has been sick, and take reasonable precautions when working with strong chemicals, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When travelling, such as on an airplane, use a paper towel when touching surfaces like the washroom tap and door handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strong chemical agents are required to kill norovirus, and most disinfecting wipes don’t do the trick. But you may be able to find specialized bleach wipes at medical supply stores. Wear protective gloves while using them, and leave them on any contaminated surface for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthmdc.com/documents/EnvironmentalCleaning.pdf#:~:text=at%20high%20temperature%20greater%20than%20170%C2%B0F" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;laundry&lt;/a&gt;, wash and dry contaminated items separately on hot (norovirus can survive temperatures up to 158F or 70C), with bleach if possible. Running a bleach cycle of the washer in between loads won’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid communal dining: &lt;/strong&gt;Take extra steps to limit exposure. Buffets and potlucks pose particular risks, since multiple people handle serving utensils, and food comes from different kitchens. “If you really want to decrease your risk, avoiding potlucks around this time of year might be helpful,” Washer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you do get norovirus, continue taking precautions after recovery, and don’t assume immunity will protect you for long. “We don’t develop robust memory immunity to norovirus,” says Love. “People can become infected by norovirus every few months because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPTWZyT25sc0ktQzBpbjJXSFhja010ejdtUVQzVFYzMXRyaUN3cDJoeHZKTTRRT2pDZXBnVE45SWxXd2NWaXl4V2wtUzR1YkhXLU9XR0ZVYjdTbm1PdnNsUXI5SF9GdkhxWGhqdEhaY2c3c0VPMUNsOUtqVlg1WW54cUpneThBOW5VcndZMEkyTEF1Z2NPb2c</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19即使在完全康复后，也会在大脑中留下持久的变化- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/covid-19-leaves-lasting-changes-in-the-brain-even-after-full-recovery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQS0JPeFFxd3F6VVE5VUpieWJSRkJXaEw5QXVjSGpoX2E3Mnd3VVRHSFdqcDJ3czRlZzdkM0tBNUNkWUg1bTBVRm5YRFZ6dkZSZUZkaHRVU2FEckVZb2tSai1FZDF1WjJxUEZzRUNRci1UbndxZnRPX09iZHdhcnd6Tm9PdkVCMjg5V290QUVqbGlfTDk4LUVnNl9Zaw</guid></item><item><title>不再有凯格尔：我找到了产后失禁的解决方案–为什么没有更多的女性知道这一点？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome of my earliest memories feature my mother’s leotard-encased body bouncing to Jane Fonda with abandon. A similar carefree fluidity prevailed a decade later, as her feet struck hard-packed sand on a shorebreak jog. Twelve-year-old me panted alongside, so desperate to be made in her image that I tolerated heated cheeks and shaking quads. Their trembling barely subsided during the one stop we made, for her to wade into the waves and pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1iz7gbk"&gt;&lt;aside data-testid="affiliate-disclaimer-inline" class="dcr-189ogop"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Soon, even that wasn’t enough to staunch the flow. She gave up and switched to hiking. “I should have done more Kegels,” she quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s how I learned – before I’d even taken the SAT – about the repetitive undercarriage squeezing recommended for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94b0c70-dfba-4178-929a-a8031f3cdb1a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried everything to fix my incontinence.

For context, in 1948 the New York Obstetrical Society &lt;a href="https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/01/fight-women-doctors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;refused to admit&lt;/a&gt; women, and as late as 1970 &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-male-gynos-20180307-htmlstory.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;only 7%&lt;/a&gt; of gynecologists were female. So it makes sense that a man created “the vaginal manometer” to record the strength of contractions of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310358" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pelvic floor muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They weaken over time as a result of things like surgery, pregnancy, vaginal delivery, smoking, and just plain &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ageing while female&lt;/a&gt;. Kegel is credited with first describing how exercising these muscles can&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reduce the type of urinary incontinence that comes with a stressor, like aerobics or jogging on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If only it were as simple as that sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually it was my turn for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). After five pregnancies and three deliveries, coughing while walking would leave me in want of fresh panties. I told my friends I could walk without peeing and I could cough without peeing, but stood no chance against two abdominal stressors at once. “Have you done your Kegels?” they’d ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few more years ticked by, and after a lap at the track I’d be so wet that it looked like I’d put my pants on over a damp bathing suit. “You’ve been doing Kegels though, right?” a friend texted in response to one of my pandemic-era rants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16557f31-48fb-4941-88ad-6eebf864dc39" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt; ‘I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: DragonImages/Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, I started paying about $90 a month to access online videos involving hip lifting and squeezing. I only did it once. By the time I turned 43, I had to wear black leggings on my Sunday morning runs so the dark outline that extended all the way to my knees wouldn’t be so stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I never mentioned my incontinence at a doctor’s appointment, and no one asked. I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels. I was the one who’d signed up for the course and not done my homework so I didn’t question the narrative of midlife incontinence being a mixture of my fault and my destiny. But what if I should have? What if a catastrophic failure of women’s health and wellness has occurred?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spoiler alert: I should have, it has, and once I figured that out, a few quick office visits changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="no-more-suffering-in-silence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;No more suffering in silence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first part of my story, the silent suffering, is hardly unique. About &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000004009" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;45% to 50%&lt;/a&gt; of women experience SUI at least once a week. Think of it this way: If you make 10 of us skip rope, at least four will later slink off to a bathroom to wrap toilet paper around the crotch of our undies. But not to a doctor’s office, research suggests. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079556/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that for every case of incontinence reported to primary care doctors, 20 go unreported. Transgender men on hormone therapy also often experience SUI, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662108/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; preliminary research. Some cis men struggle with SUI too, usually after treatment for prostate cancer, but &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/00005392-200102000-00013" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;many, many fewer&lt;/a&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For years, I just sucked it up, idiomatically and also literally, with the tissues I carried everywhere. Then one Sunday in February of 2024, something clicked. I’d run a 10K, rather than my usual 5K, on a path way out by the water, too far to make it home to change before &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/04/quaker-parenting-research/682277/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;. Tissues it is then. The entryway smelled like urine, but I didn’t think much of it, with all the older folks there to worship. The elevator also reeked. As I moved through more spaces, a terrible realization swept over me. I whispered in my husband’s ear: “Is that odor me?” His widened, almost guilt-ridden eyes were my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later that same evening, I sat in bed, showered and fresh. Until I sneezed. After a few moments of disbelief, staring down at my wet pajama shorts, I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called University of California, San Francisco’s Women’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I can’t even do one thing without peeing any more,” I told Dr Michelle Van Kuiken, less than two weeks later. Apparently, I had four main options: (1) pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which is more than Kegels, but also, is Kegels, (2) the Poise Impressa, a tampon-like contraption you can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34505171/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insert into your vagina&lt;/a&gt; in order to “gently lift and support the urethra”, according to its promotional materials, (3) bulking agent, sort of like lip fillers, but injected into the tissues of the urethra to make the opening smaller, and (4) the “sling”, a gold-standard surgery that creates a hammock for the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I quickly ruled out PFMT, having written “do Kegels” on my to-do list for the previous seven years and not getting them to-done. The second option seemed silly, given the bedtime incident. Was I supposed to sprint to the bathroom cabinet for an Impressa when I felt a sneeze coming on? The surgery &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9753142/#:~:text=Approximately%202.4%25%20of%20women%20receiving,long%20term%20follow%2Dup%20period" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9169553/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;last me&lt;/a&gt; decades (only about 2.5% of women need a new one after 10 years and less than 20% have re-upped at 15 years), but it would require general anesthesia with its attendant risks, and I wouldn’t be able to exercise for two weeks or have sex for at least four. Exercise is my antidepressant! So is sex!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That left the fillers, what doctors call a “submucosal bulking agent”. Dr Van Kuiken’s staff made a quick call to my insurance company for approval, and told me I could receive the injection the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She warned me that it could end up taking me longer to pee and asked what would bug me more: that delay or leakage? She also offered a heads-up that it would hurt. I figured short-term pain sucks, but after childbirth, I can handle it. And you know what would suck more? Ending up like my grandma, whose bulky adult diapers made a crinkling sound when she sat, yet still weren’t effective enough for her to be comfortable in public. Not wanting that kind of isolation, I decided fillers were worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cadb01ac-6d42-47d4-a4f5-7d0f29dc5c12" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called UCSF’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic Health.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Catherine McQueen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With my feet in stirrups and a drape spread over my knees, the ghost of pap smears past floated in the air. Starting the same way my IUD insertions had, Dr Van Kuiken first injected lidocaine to numb my urethra and its surrounding tissues. That burned some, like a vaccine, only unfortunately placed. While we waited for it to take effect, she explained that my urethra was sort of like a deflated, doughnut-shaped pool float. By spacing four injections just right, she could plump it up without leaving a low side. Now, those injections? Those hurt quite a bit: Think bee sting plus bikini wax for at least 15 seconds each. Still, when they were done, they were done. The whole thing was no worse than a facial laser treatment like &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/considering-broadband-light-therapy-heres-what-you-need-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;broadband light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, and I soon walked comfortably home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The next day, I went for a run with the aforementioned baby brother, who’s now 31. Nothing. Not a drop. At the tail end of a jog with one of my teenage daughters a few weeks later, I tried to sprint and felt a familiar dribble. So I went back to Dr Van Kuiken, and four weeks after the initial procedure she injected about 30% more Bulkamid. (It’s not uncommon for women to need a “top-off” injection to achieve results and durability.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I hardly realized I’d come to fear leakage, until all of a sudden I didn’t. I had no idea my gait had changed to try to minimize wetness, until my stride lengthened in the months after the procedures. The way I held my abdomen shifted, as did my times, soon matching my high school best, and then faster. I started running more – and having more fun doing it. It’s been more than a year now, and I’ve completed seven half marathons on trails up and down mountains. Without. A. Drop. And straight to church I can go, with nary a worry or a tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, a quick, safe, minimally invasive, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730435/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost-effective&lt;/a&gt; procedure eliminated my incontinence and significantly improved my quality of life. And here’s the kicker: When Dr Van Kuiken did my physical exam, after I’d already chosen fillers, she said: “Your pelvic floor is actually really strong. No amount of Kegels was going to fix this for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6bbb0d75-0152-416e-a9dc-df2fb046fe08" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘A quick, safe, minimally invasive, and cost-effective procedure eliminated my incontinence.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jay Boncodin/Courtesy of Gail Cornwall&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-dont-more-women-know-about-treatment-options" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why don’t more women know about treatment options?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It took me years to get good care, but more than that, years to even find out a solution existed. It doesn’t have to be this way. As one group of researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727114/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summed it up&lt;/a&gt;: “SUI is not part of normal ageing and can be remedied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But most women don’t know that. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24807341/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that less than 15% of those bothered by SUI receive an injection or surgery. Anecdotally, that statistic rings true: every last one of the people I told about my procedures said they had no idea such a thing was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You’d think that’s because the FDA only &lt;a href="https://www.bulkamid.com/blog/fda-approves-bulkamid-in-the-united-states-and-is-now-set-for-launch-in-quarter-1-2020/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Bulkamid in 2020, but bulking agents &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Urogynecology_and_Reconstructive_Pelvic.html?id=sKkTBQAAQBAJ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were first used&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s. Innovations in the late 80s made them a more viable option, and now, they can sometimes last 96 months or more for those who are eligible. (Doctors won’t inject bulking agent if, for example, you have an active urinary tract infection.) That can mean eight years of staying dry, or much drier, while belly laughing or lifting a squirmy baby. Most women also don’t know that using synthetic mesh in sling operations starting in 1996 eliminated the need for an abdominal incision and an overnight stay. They don’t know that hormones &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/does-incontinence-get-worse-during-menopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can affect&lt;/a&gt; SUI. We just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We believe Kegels are it. As it turns out, Dr Van Kuiken is a big fan of PFMT as a risk-free option. But its efficacy for SUI depends on the cause and severity of the incontinence. What’s more, that acronym encapsulates a lot of different practices, so different that &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00404-022-06693-z&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;researchers don’t actually know&lt;/a&gt; how effective PFMT is. PFMT with biofeedback, for example, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825641" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has been shown to&lt;/a&gt; work better than without it. In plain English, that means Kegel-like therapies &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; work&lt;/a&gt; for SUI, but doctors don’t know how often or how well they &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work, especially since the exercises can be time-consuming. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19281321/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers asked women to do exercises for &lt;em&gt;45 minutes a day&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not the only one for whom that’s never going to happen. As one friend put it in a text: “They just told me to do kegals which I don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And shame keeps women from learning about other options. Women who do come forward are often told to lose weight or cut out alcohol or sweeteners. Sometimes they’re instructed to drink more water, sometimes less. Sometimes to avoid tea, &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;but maybe&lt;/a&gt; add in decaffeinated coffee. Each of these “behavioral and lifestyle” recommendations can be read to imply that a woman is suffering because she’s been lazy or made bad decisions about what she puts in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That feels gendered. When men have a quality-of-life issue, we try to fix it. (Hello, Viagra.) When women have a problem, we tell them they wouldn’t if they’d just been a bit better and tried a bit harder, and also, to just deal. (Combine those Kegels with “&lt;a href="https://nationalincontinence.com/pages/compare_belted_undergarments" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;belted undergarments&lt;/a&gt;” and pricey &lt;a href="https://rtaesthetics.co.uk/urinary-incontinence/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;med-spa treatments&lt;/a&gt;, ladies!) I’m exaggerating somewhat, but also, there are &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-01472-5&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;real disparities&lt;/a&gt; in funding for research on women’s health, female inclusion in clinical trials, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For me, finally receiving the right care was life-altering. After yearning to be just like my mother for so long, starting to pee myself seemed like a particularly embarrassing case of “be careful what you wish for.” But not any more. Now, I’m high and dry, even on a trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When my bulking injections wear off in a few years, I’ll probably ask for more. Although, maybe I’ll be like my mom, who at age 75 hops on to the treadmill unworried. She got the sling surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQUUo3b2RuZkxJZ09oa0I2WXpncFlMRElmUF9qa19QbGgyWi03YW5YSUdNdUZ6OE1keWRqcVdFb2Fkbkg3bldra1pMRXZJMWtrVEZGMGIybzc2X0JpWFpJcHdHb3VWeXFSdlN5OE0tSVVoMENKS3k4VXNnLWVMSVM2V3pPRUlsM0c2UFFTQjlCLUVaUndoX1BhQmMyOHZMMDR4UjZOYQ</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的流感活动急剧上升，至少有750万人患病： CDC - ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/flu-activity-rises-sharply-us-75-million-illnesses/story?id=128765018</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Flu activity is rising sharply across the United States, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC estimates there have been at least ​7.5 million illnesses, ​81,000 hospitalizations and ​3,100 deaths from flu so far this season. ​Five more pediatric deaths were reported this week, bringing the total to ​eight this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Public health experts previously told ABC News that many of this season's cases are linked to a new flu strain called subclade K -- a variant of the H3N2 virus, which is itself a subtype of influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Subclade K has been circulating since the summer in other countries and was a main driver of a spike in flu cases in Canada, Japan and the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 1,600 flu samples tested by the CDC, roughly ​92% were H3N2.

                &lt;p&gt;2025 has proven to be a nightmare year for measles, with the U.S. reaching a toll not seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the latest data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been more than 2,000 recorded cases of measles this year. Most of these infections are occurring among the unvaccinated and  children. Several outbreaks are still ongoing, and the U.S. is likely to lose its official measles-free status as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A record-setting year&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 23, there have been 2,012 confirmed measles cases in the U.S., the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tally is the highest seen since measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, surpassing the previous modern high of 1,274 cases in 2019; it’s also the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases. However, experts have said that these current numbers are almost certainly an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest outbreak began in early January along parts of Western Texas. But measles has spread far and wide across the U.S. this year, with cases seen in 43 states, along with 50 separate outbreaks. About two-thirds of reported cases have occurred among children under the age of 18, and 93% involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Three people in the U.S. have died from measles this year, while 227 have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The official return of measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the Texas outbreak formally ended in August, there is concern that some current outbreaks are genetically linked to it. If that’s true, then we will soon pass the one-year mark of measles circulating locally in the country. And once that happens, the World Health Organization is expected to declare that measles has officially returned to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. would hardly be alone in welcoming measles back. In November, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;similarly lost&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status. The viral disease has &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;also resurged&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The return of measles has been fueled by waning vaccination rates. It’s a problem that precedes the installment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,—a long time enemy of vaccines—as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But Kennedy hasn’t &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-ways-rfk-jr-has-harmed-public-health-this-year-2000698509" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt; the situation, either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, for instance, RFK Jr. and his allies have restricted people’s access to certain vaccines. He’s also reduced the workforce of the CDC and other health agencies, as well as personally fired senior officials who refused to back his anti-vaccine policies. And during the Texas measles outbreak, he recommended unsupported treatments like cod liver oil that may have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vitamin-a-fix-for-measles-is-hurting-kids-in-texas-2000585347" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;further endangered&lt;/a&gt; some children. Next year, he may even succeed at &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-tried-to-wreck-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-over-the-weekend-2000702477" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;dramatically shortening&lt;/a&gt; the childhood vaccination schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one positive silver lining is that the overall vaccination rate for measles (above 90%) is still high in the U.S., at least for now. But it has been declining lately and it’s not high enough to ensure herd immunity for people unable to get vaccinated, such as very young children (the first measles shot, of three, isn’t typically given until age one). So while most Americans will remain protected against measles, it could continue to cause widespread outbreaks in vulnerable regions for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2025 has been a bad year for measles, but the worst may yet be to come.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians favor plant-based eating, including legumes, whole grains, and sweet potatoes, for their long-living benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil, nuts, and seeds are essential for heart-healthy fats, vitamins, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small quantities of fish, antioxidant-rich tea, and turmeric keep centenarians thriving with optimal brain and immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

From their research, they’ve teased out lifestyle similarities across these unique individuals, from food choices, social practices, and general attitudes and outlooks on life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve spoken to a handful of experts on the topic to better understand the common practices of those in this illustrious group—particularly when it comes to what they eat. Read on to discover some of the top diet staples for those who live for a century or more.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthy-habits-of-centenarians"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Healthy Habits of Centenarians &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Centenarians live all over the world, but some places have better recordkeeping than others – and those places often have more documented centenarians. This is one cause of the ‘Blue Zone' phenomenon,” says Ben Meyers, the founder of LongeviQuest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dan Buettner was the founder of the trademarked Blue Zones concept that identifies places where groups of centenarians are concentrated. These areas are found all across the globe, on nearly every continent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“However, some more well known Blue Zone locations include rural areas such as Okinawa, Japan, Ikaria, Greece, Sardinia, Italy, and Loma Linda, USA,” says Bradley J. Willcox MSc, MD, FGSA, FRSM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And when it comes to lifestyle, quite a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-live-to-100-8734564" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;few commonalities&lt;/a&gt; have been discovered amongst those living in these areas. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/stress-relieving-foods-7643866" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Avoiding stress&lt;/a&gt; in everyday life is one philosophy that many centenarians practice. “We’ve found that centenarians focus on their lives and the lives of the people they love, instead of problems beyond their control,” Meyers says. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In a similar vein, Blue Zoners tend to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/emotional-health/10-ways-happier" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;find joy&lt;/a&gt; in everyday life. “The concept of suffering for 50 weeks to splurge on a two-week vacation would bewilder a centenarian,” Meyers adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maintaining a positive attitude as well as “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/workouts/how-to-start-working-out" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt;, having a strong sense of community, and avoiding smoking are other key factors to improving longevity,” says Amy Davis, RDN.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-foods-centenarians-eat-often"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 8 Foods Centenarians Eat Often &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what may fascinate people most about these long-lived individuals are the foods they eat and the habits they have around eating. “Some eating patterns seen in centenarians include eating a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/easy-healthy-breakfast-ideas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;large breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, eating mostly &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-plant-based-foods-nutrition-experts-always-recommend-11680448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding weight-loss diets, moderating &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-alcohol-to-drink-8391763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, and reserving sweets for celebrations,” says Davis. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With these practices in mind, here are eight foods researchers have identified as diet staples for centenarians:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One of the top foods amongst centenarians is legumes, which are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and provide plant-based protein,” Davis explains. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are thought to help control cholesterol and blood sugar, as well as lower the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease.” Legumes encompass beans, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/health-benefits-of-peas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/lentil-salad-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;. So, regardless of whether you typically reach for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/ways-to-use-chickpeas-meal-prep" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, black beans, red lentils, snap peas, or otherwise, all of them will help promote longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another common ingredient found in the kitchens of those living to (or well-past) 100 is olive oil. This culinary staple is high in healthy unsaturated fats that support optimal cholesterol levels. It’s also rich in micronutrients like plant compounds, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamins/vitamin-e-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-k-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; that serve as antioxidants to lower inflammation throughout the body, further decreasing chronic disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Nuts and Seeds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts, which are full of vitamins, minerals, and unsaturated fats, are also staples in centenarians' diets,” says Davis, “Nuts are associated with reduced risk for heart disease and inflammation, likely due to their rich &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19192028/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; content.” Given that &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/these-are-the-10-best-nut-and-seed-butters-for-a-protein-boost" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; have a similar nutritional composition to nuts, they also elicit similar longevity benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tea &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s green, black, herbal, caffeinated, or decaf, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-tea-to-drink-daily-8608683" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; is one of the top beverages among Blue Zoners. This is likely thanks to the multitude of antioxidant-rich plant compounds it contains. In fact, tea consumption has been shown to support immune, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24972454/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-for-gut-health-8762795" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34784347/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30585192/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;metabolic&lt;/a&gt; health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Seafood &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Researchers have also found that centenarians eat smaller amounts of meat and tend to include more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/heathy-fish-shrimp-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and other lean seafood in their diets,” says Davis. This may be due to the fact that many Blue Zones are located near the ocean. However, certain types of seafood (like fatty fish) serve as some of the few naturally concentrated sources of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are potent anti-inflammatory agents that encourage optimal immune, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9641984/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Whole Wheat Sourdough Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole wheat sourdough bread combines a few common food trends seen across centenarians. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/a&gt; are another common denominator of centenarians. They are rich in fiber, minerals, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, especially when compared to their white, refined counterparts,” explains Davis, “Eating whole grains is associated with a lower mortality risk from cardiovascular disease and cancer.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Many centenarians are known for their high energy levels. Starchy foods may help centenarians stay active until very late in life,” Meyers adds.&lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2020/07/blue-zones-diet-food-secrets-of-the-worlds-longest-lived-people/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Researchers also discovered&lt;/a&gt; that many people living to 100 or longer bake their own bread—a lot of times using &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/preparation/sourdough-starter" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/a&gt;. This living culture of bacteria sparks fermentation in bread dough, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5302394/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;digest some of the gluten&lt;/a&gt; it contains and increasing the digestibility of the final product. Sourdough bread also tends to have a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000543/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; than other loaves, supporting blood sugar management and metabolic health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you watched the Netflix documentary, then you may remember the Japanese purple sweet potatoes that served as a staple food for Okinawan centenarians. And while this specific variety of potato may be tricky to track down in the States, your everyday &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/sweet-potato-nutrition" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/american-consumers-new-favorite-supermarket-chain-8559639" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;grocery store&lt;/a&gt; is pretty similar nutritionally. Both types of sweet potato are rich in fiber and micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-a-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/vitamin-c-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, and plant compounds. These help to improve immune, heart, and metabolic health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And finally, certain nutrient-dense spices, like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-turmeric-8633964" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, can also promote longevity. “Turmeric is rich in phytonutrients, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/flavonoid-rich-foods-8787107" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;such as flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, that may be beneficial to living longer,” says Willcox.

If their new model turns out to be right, the scientists behind it suggest it could explain why these conditions affect so many systems in the body, and could help inform the search for long-awaited treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) is a historically misunderstood and stigmatized chronic condition. As the name suggests, one of the key symptoms is severe fatigue, but patients experience &lt;a href="https://meassociation.org.uk/me-cfs-symptoms-diagnosis/" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; affecting a whole range of organs and systems, from pain, to temperature and light sensitivity, to brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different degrees of severity and no known cure, and there’s been a lot of &lt;a href="https://impact.ed.ac.uk/opinion/me-origins-of-a-modern-medical-scandal/" target="_blank"&gt;debate and controversy&lt;/a&gt; in recent years around treatment approaches. There has also been landmark research to attempt to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/8-key-dna-regions-more-likely-to-be-altered-in-people-with-mecfs-finds-27000-strong-study-80341" target="_blank"&gt;identify the causes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-blood-test-offers-potential-for-simple-accurate-mecfs-diagnosis-researchers-claim-other-experts-arent-so-sure-81088" target="_blank"&gt;develop a reliable test&lt;/a&gt; for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trigger that has been recognized is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-is-just-like-other-post-viral-syndromes-health-chief-argues-73403" target="_blank"&gt;viral infection&lt;/a&gt;. Though not all patients can trace the onset of their symptoms back to a viral illness, in many cases it’s thought that infection with a virus such as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-epstein-barr-virus-causes-multiple-sclerosis-and-where-science-is-on-a-cure-78701" target="_blank"&gt;Epstein-Barr&lt;/a&gt; sparks the development or worsening of ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conviction was only strengthened when COVID-19 came on the scene. Back in 2020, some of the earliest COVID patients were &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-patients-say-they-still-struggle-to-convince-medics-their-illness-is-real-78584" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that they had recovered from their initial illness, only to be struck down by a constellation of symptoms that would go on to persist for months or even years. This was what came to be known as long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study identified a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-whove-had-covid-could-be-almost-8-times-as-likely-to-develop-mecfs-77612" target="_blank"&gt;strong link between ME/CFS and long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, and there is substantial symptom overlap between the two conditions. As understanding of long COVID has increased and research into its causes and potential treatments has ramped up, many in the ME/CFS community have expressed hope that this could have a knock-on positive impact on research into ME/CFS as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr-Ayt1Ne24?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new paper from scientists mainly based at Renegade Research in Denver, Colorado is forming part of the effort to figure out the underlying basis of some of the overlapping symptoms. According to the team’s modeling, damage to the brainstem could be the key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In vulnerable individuals,” they write, “an infection may damage the connective tissue structures responsible for maintaining the physical integrity of the brainstem. This can lead to neuromechanical pathologies such as craniocervical instability (CCI) and intracranial pressure dysregulation that cause mechanical deformation or displacement of the brainstem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, they say, could impact the immune system, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-is-the-vagus-nerve-so-important-70392" target="_blank"&gt;autonomic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, and metabolism, explaining the multi-system nature of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go on to outline a seven-step pathological process beginning with the initial infection and immune response. In some cases, they believe that the immune system could go too far and cause excess damage to the tissues in the brainstem that maintain its structure, and if this does not heal it could eventually lead to chronic brain inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the brainstem is a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/a-woman-born-missing-most-of-her-brain-just-celebrated-her-20th-birthday-what-does-that-mean-81573" target="_blank"&gt;major control center&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of vital functions, the longer this goes on, the more chance of downstream effects like re-activation of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-cold-sore-virus-that-you-probably-have-silently-invades-the-human-brain-76636" target="_blank"&gt;dormant viruses&lt;/a&gt;, immune dysregulation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting hypothesis, one that the authors say fills in some of the gaps in other theories of how ME/CFS develops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there can be individual variability in the presentation of ME/CFS, the core diagnostic features involve processes that are regulated by the brainstem. These features are present in all people with the diagnosis,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to previous &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/covid-19-damages-a-major-brain-control-center-ultra-powerful-mri-scans-reveal-76273" target="_blank"&gt;brain imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; in patient populations that have identified brainstem abnormalities in both long COVID and ME/CFS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the authors of the paper is also offered as a case study – he claims that his own severe ME went into remission after surgery to correct a CCI. While the team accepts that anecdotal evidence like this can’t necessarily be applied more broadly to other patients, they propose that it could offer a basis for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This model can be tested at each step of the causal chain. It has interdisciplinary relevance and can be explored and tested by many different fields of research,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is to inspire new research and treatments for patients suffering from a neglected and debilitating disease that has long been considered a mystery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987725002518" target="_blank"&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:05:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNdzFRUnZrWmZyUUcwaUFRdmxTNkVjY3RVMGdVODVHVDlmS1ZWVnIwSkxRWDZOaVpNaWhRTFN1REtMbzh3bTg5ZmRpTnB3cjlzOVlPRGF5Z1NSRDk3YlFJVWduVjlwbHFfYWJ1ZE1WSDJZQ0h5aVg2cE83b2doclZKdDVkLVloSklrRDJCZHAycEpoS2d0czg3ZXdpOFJpUF9KajA0aFZLNVJTc0JXT2o2NkYybFYzbmc</guid></item><item><title>完美的午餐休息时间：如何远离办公桌–并抓住这一天-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/perfect-lunch-break-away-from-desk-seize-the-day</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;y quest for the ideal lunch break is definitely a triumph of hope over experience. From inventing endless super-soups that might banish the mid-afternoon snack attack, to wildly optimistic lunchtime to-do lists, I have tried and failed countless times. The executive coach &lt;a href="https://www.zoethompson.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Zoe Thomson&lt;/a&gt; is not surprised. “One of the biggest things for people is they overestimate how much time and energy they are going to have in their lunch hour,” says Thomson, who previously had a 20-year career with the Avon and Somerset police. “And they underestimate how much time and energy they might need to achieve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I tell her that this has been the flaw with most of my doomed lunchtime masterplans. “The problem is, unpredictable things happen. Say you plan to do a 45-minute spin class in a 60-minute lunch break, but your last call overruns by 10 minutes. Your plan is no longer feasible. If you decided instead to do a 10-minute walk around the block every day, and then have a nice cup of tea after your sandwich, you’re winning. Even if something urgent comes up, the 10-minute walk is still possible. And on a really good day you could walk four times around the block.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I confess that I find this idea a bit uninspiring. How am I going to transform my lung capacity by ambling to the end of the road? “Actually, when you look at the most successful people, they do the boring, small, incremental changes daily and stick with it,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3db36540-0d4e-4fe1-a74a-c1faf749c53f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Try to fit in a 10-minute walk every day.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by models; JohnnyGreig/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even if you’re ensconced in a healthy routine, there can still be space to mix it up. “As humans, we like certainty, but we crave variety,” she says. And after a morning of work, she points out, many of us struggle with decision fatigue. “So if we aim for 80% routine and 20% variety, that’s probably about right. Having to make a fresh decision about what to do for lunch every day creates stress,” says Thomson. Having occasional lunch breaks with a shared activity can be great – a book group works well, as does an uplifting choir session such as those organised by &lt;a href="https://www.musicinoffices.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Music in Offices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://selinabarker.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Selina Barker&lt;/a&gt; is a coach and creator of &lt;a href="https://projectyoujournals.com/time-to-thrive-journal" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Time to Thrive&lt;/a&gt;, a journal that focuses on energy management rather than time. “However long your lunch break lasts, even if it’s only 10 minutes, the key point is that it’s there to top your energy back up. The prescription for how you do this will vary depending on the type of work you do. So if you’ve been in meetings all morning with people talking at you, maybe what you need is a quiet walk in the park – especially for introverts working in an open-plan office. But if you’ve been on your feet for hours, maybe the best thing would be a yoga or meditation class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work in an office, it can sometimes feel a bit awkward to step away from the canteen crowd and go off on your own. Barker says we shouldn’t feel embarrassed about prioritising what we actually need. “Don’t make a big thing of it. Just say I’m off to recharge my batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it comes to the main event – the food – choosing what to eat can be tricky. Ideally, we want something that is enticing, yet still healthy and will sustain our energy until home time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="da6f0c49-2948-4fdb-bbbe-2c54fd46571f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Add wholegrains to ensure your salad is filling enough.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The lunches that work against you are usually the highly refined ones,” says the nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.rosemarynutrition.co.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rosemary Martin&lt;/a&gt;. “A pastry or white-bread sandwich with crisps or a chocolate bar on the side gives you a quick boost followed by a predictable drop in energy and concentration.” But not all lunches labelled healthy are good either. “The tiny low-carb salad may feel virtuous at midday but leaves you tired, distracted and craving sugar a couple of hours later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:6060,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;how-to-have-a-better-day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sign up to our 16-part series and get expert advice on how to improve your life - from morning to night&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;How to have a better day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Twice weekly, for eight weeks&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You're signed up to How to have a better day.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Martin suggests that if you want steady energy and clear focus after lunch, the magic ingredient is balance. “Go for meals that combine whole grains, plant protein, healthy fats and colourful vegetables that will digest at a comfortable pace and give your brain what it needs to stay focused into the afternoon. Lentil soup with wholegrain bread, a tofu, rice and veg bowl or a hummus wrap with plenty of crunchy salad are simple but nourishing options which will reliably carry you through the rest of your day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those who work at home, all of this becomes a lot easier. You can exercise at home and prepare lunch far from the horrors of the office microwave. But experts point out that there are still important issues to be mindful of. A common strategy is skipping the lunch break altogether in order to finish early. “I do often question it when people tell me they’re saving that hour for the end of the day. I think that takes away from what the lunch break is actually for,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, she agrees that for some people, taking an entire hour might not make sense. “You could split the hour into three 20-minute breaks spread across the afternoon or two half-hour ones,” she says, but the principles remain the same. Are you stepping away from your desk? “Are you taking time to get up and move (or sit down and rest if you’re on your feet all day?) Are you giving yourself some downtime? If you don’t create that space to slow down the brain, it will wake you up at three or four in the morning.” It’s much better, she says, “to give yourself headspace by design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdDU2Tm0yVkJ3OGN6UWRsZE9mZmFBWXVNbk43S0NCQ3ZoSERoOWltUWdFTDBzZXVqV1VPVF8wWHl1dk1KOGpIYTJNYkpFaGpCbjI2bDNrczE5THNBOXdYWjcyUnF6R0tJMTVCYVdyY011dzhRYXQ2R1BTTFZ4WUN4bHJKV0dQMmcyd1VoeklaS2tVbENidktUV1QzN19KZWV6a1Bn</guid></item><item><title>流感在纽约肆虐。如果您生病了，该怎么办。- Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/the-flu-is-surging-in-nyc-heres-what-to-do-if-youre-sickened</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="nxm5b"&gt;Getting sick is never fun, but navigating the flu in crowded New York City can be especially challenging, with limited space to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7hggd"&gt;Yet there is an upside to getting sick in the five boroughs, where there's an abundance of doctors and pharmacies, and restaurants that will deliver soup to your very stoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="afnvj"&gt;New York is experiencing a &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-state-has-set-a-record-for-flu-cases-ahead-of-peak-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;historic flu outbreak&lt;/a&gt; this season, with more than 70,000 new cases recorded statewide the week before Christmas.

If you don’t regularly see a doctor, you can check with your insurer or a website like Zocdoc for a list of providers who are covered under your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1nrgs"&gt;Dr. Andrew Wallach, ambulatory care chief medical officer at NYC Health + Hospitals, recommended that you get tested for the flu as soon as possible after you start to feel sick. He said antiviral medications like Tamiflu, which treat the flu, are most effective if taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8svih"&gt;People who are not yet sick but face increased risk of serious illness, like the elderly, can also sometimes qualify for prophylaxis medications that help to prevent sickness, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7840k"&gt;Wallach also said any New Yorker who feels sick can reach out to &lt;a href="https://expresscare.nyc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Health + Hospitals’ virtual ExpressCare&lt;/a&gt;, which offers telehealth consultations in more than 200 languages 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="5jgmu"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To quarantine or not to quarantine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ed5gb"&gt;When you have the flu, isolating from others is the most reliable way to avoid getting anyone else sick. But in New York City, that’s not always an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1lnv7"&gt;If you live with others, Wallach said, wearing a mask in common spaces can help to prevent the spread of illness. He also recommended regular hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of three to six feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7uhrb"&gt;If you’re a parent and your child gets sick, masking and wearing gloves or regularly washing your hands can reduce your chances of catching the flu, said Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2fs90"&gt;“ Not everyone wants to do that around their kid. But it does work,” she said. “I see kids with the flu all the time, and I wear a mask and gloves in my office, and so far I haven't caught the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4i0qg"&gt;If your sick child can recover in a separate bedroom, Kravitz said, that’s ideal. But if they need to share a space with siblings who aren’t sick, she said, those who are old enough to mask can do so. She said parents should also regularly wipe down surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="eaupn"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fueling yourself — or your loved one — to feel better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fc76s"&gt;Wallach and Kravitz both said hydration is a key component to recovery. Kravitz recommended lots of water, but also other fluids that contain electrolytes, like Pedialyte popsicles for younger kids and Gatorade for older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d8gbf"&gt;“ I usually tell parents, just get something into them. Even if that means giving them a little bit of juice, that's not the end of the world,” she said, adding: “ Anything that they want to drink to make sure that they're hydrating themselves is good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f38b7"&gt;When asked whether soup is actually an effective medicine, Wallach confirmed the myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8brg7"&gt;“ It is somewhat of an old wives’ tale,” he said. “However, it is rooted in science — and that is, if you eat soup, it's going to help maintain your hydration status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4e1vq"&gt;Many New York City restaurants are available for soup delivery, whether you’re in the mood for ramen, pho, matzoh ball soup or ajiaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="a88ke"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When it may be time for more serious treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95i32"&gt;Kravitz said she recommends that parents bring their child to the doctor if they continue to have a fever for more than four or five days, because they may also be sick with something other than the flu, like strep throat. The flu and COVID are just two of many illnesses circulating in New York this winter, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/respiratory-illness-data/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city health data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ei7eh"&gt;Kravitz said parents should consider seeking treatment for their kids at the hospital if they are struggling to breathe, have a high fever that leads to disorientation or are so dehydrated that they are not urinating on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2iuam"&gt;For adults, it might be necessary to go to the hospital if you can’t keep fluids down or your fever persists even with fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, Wallach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1pu3r"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re not sick yet, it’s not too late to get the flu shot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="44u2a"&gt;If you haven’t gotten the flu yet and you haven’t been vaccinated, both doctors recommend getting the shot now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evgjn"&gt;“ It takes about two weeks for you to get full impact and protection from the vaccine,” Wallach said. “We have not yet peaked here in New York City, so you can still protect yourself by getting a flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="30nrb"&gt;The city health department has a &lt;a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/NYCHealthMap/ServiceCategory/Vaccines" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine map&lt;/a&gt; where you can find sites offering the flu shot.

If you still think the brain is set and change only goes one direction — downhill — you haven’t been keeping up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Same with the idea that you can’t do anything about your risk for Alzheimer’s disease. It turns out that while it’s true there’s no medicine that cures the disease, a healthy lifestyle is now believed to be powerful medicine to slow Alzheimer’s down and maybe head it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That news is one of many key findings regarding Alzheimer’s, which more than 7.4 million adults in the U.S. live with, including 38,300 in Utah and 55 million worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Here are seven things to know about Alzheimer’s and neurocognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Change-your-lifestyle-change-your-risk" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Change your lifestyle, change your risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Perhaps the biggest finding is that while no one was cured of Alzheimer’s disease in the nearly 120 years since it was first diagnosed by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, there’s strong evidence suggesting lifestyle and medical approaches can reduce the risk and perhaps even stop someone from developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Alzheimer’s Association’s two-year &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/us-pointer/study-results.asp" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.alz.org/us-pointer/study-results.asp"&gt;U.S. POINTER clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that those at risk of cognitive decline and dementia who “follow a rigorous lifestyle program, including diet and exercise components as well as cognitive challenges,” appeared to gain resilience against cognitive decline, according to a news bulletin from the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Stacie Kulp, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association of Utah, said in a written statement that “researchers believe about 40% of all cases can be prevented or delayed. There are a number of steps that we can take to protect our cognitive health and, ideally, prevent this tragic disease from getting a foothold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Both structured and self-guided interventions in the study helped cognitive function over two years for those at risk of cognitive decline. Benefits were greater for those in the structured group, who had coaching and peer support focused on exercise, nutrition, cognitive training and health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/5d1826c1-1ddd-49ca-badc-44deed8eee40/uspointerbrainhealthrecipe.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/5d1826c1-1ddd-49ca-badc-44deed8eee40/uspointerbrainhealthrecipe.pdf"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for how the changes might be structured include 30-35 minutes of moderate-to-intense aerobic exercise four times a week, with flexibility and strength training twice a week. A computer-based brain training program is recommended three times a week in half-hour sessions, plus other intellectually challenging and social activities. As for diet, the key is the MIND diet — it stands for “Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay” — with focus on dark leafy greens, berries, nuts, whole grains, olive oil and fish. Keeping track of blood pressure, weight and lab results is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study found improved cognition regardless of sex, ethnicity, heart health status or genetic risk. Even those in the high-risk APOE4 carrier group benefit — and it seems they actually benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The association plans to offer a personal brain health web-based tool and a virtual training program for health care providers, among other related initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="People-want-to-know-their-status-early" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;People want to know their status early&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Years ago, with no good treatment and no cure, there didn’t seem to be much point in learning early whether you were headed toward Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A nationwide survey by the Alzheimer’s Association in 2025 found close to 4 in 5 Americans 45 and older want to know if they have Alzheimer’s before symptoms appear. And 91% said they would take a simple test — like a blood biomarker test — if they could. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The survey also found that nearly 6 in 10 respondents said they would accept a “moderate or high level of risk” from medication if it could slow the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly, senior director of Community Programs and Services for the association, said that shows the importance of making diagnostic testing widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Blood-test-helps-with-diagnosis" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Blood test helps with diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;An expensive PET scan or spinal tap are no longer the only ways to find evidence of Alzheimer’s disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two different blood tests to help detect the disease, though they’re not intended to be the only diagnostic tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The FDA approved the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio test, for use to find amyloid plaques in those 50 and older who have symptoms of cognitive decline. The association offers clinical guidelines to help specialists decide if the test is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More recently, FDA cleared the Elecsys pTau181 plasma test for use in primary care. “Approved for adults 55 and older with cognitive symptoms, the test helps rule out Alzheimer’s-related brain changes and may reduce the need for PET scans or spinal taps in certain clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The association emphasizes that diagnosis remains a multi-step process and urges providers to use blood biomarker tests “alongside established ‘gold standard’ tests, clinical judgment and evolving guidelines,” per an Alzheimer’s Association statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Heart-health-drug-combo-may-help-brain" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Heart-health drug combo may help brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Using a combination of drugs commonly prescribed to treat blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes may be just what the doctor ordered to help the brain by slowing cognitive decline. Blood pressure and cholesterol medications were most helpful in combination if only two medications were used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Washington, Seattle, found that statins and antihypertensives could lower the risk of Alzheimer’s by 21%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/combinations-cardiovascular-drugs-dementia-alzheimers-risk/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://today.usc.edu/combinations-cardiovascular-drugs-dementia-alzheimers-risk/"&gt;USC news release&lt;/a&gt;, while tau tangles and amyloid plaques are considered the main drivers of the disease, “researchers have discovered that there are a variety of underlying factors that contribute to the risk of developing the disease. Those include inflammation, genetics and cardiovascular factors like high blood pressure, obesity and overall heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The cholesterol drugs tested were pravastatin and rosuvastatin, and when combined with high blood pressure medication showed the greatest impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, hope had been placed on the super-popular semaglutide GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. That hope has not proved true to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In early clinical trials, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/health/ozempic-wegovy-alzheimers-novo-nordisk.html#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20Novo%20Nordisk%20announced,That%20drug%20had%20no%20effect." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/health/ozempic-wegovy-alzheimers-novo-nordisk.html#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20Novo%20Nordisk%20announced,That%20drug%20had%20no%20effect."&gt;worth noting&lt;/a&gt; that a study by Novo Nordisk of the two drugs did not alter cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Vaccines-may-reduce-risk-of-Alzheimer's" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Vaccines may reduce risk of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Research from the University of Texas’ McGovern Medical School found that an annual flu vaccine was linked to a 40% decrease in risk of developing Alzheimer’s over the next four years. Just one annual shot was associated with 17% lower risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html#:~:text=An%20unusual%20public%20health%20policy,the%20progress%20of%20the%20disease." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html#:~:text=An%20unusual%20public%20health%20policy,the%20progress%20of%20the%20disease."&gt;Stanford University research&lt;/a&gt; presented similar good news regarding the shingles vaccine. An examination of Welsh health records found risk of Alzheimer’s or other dementia later in life fell by 20-39% among those who got the &lt;mark class="hl_yellow"&gt;Zostavax/Shingrix shingles vaccine.&lt;/mark&gt; The findings could mean that viruses like varicella zoster, responsible for shingles, affect brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Mouse-studies-offer-hope-for-future-prevention-cure" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Mouse studies offer hope for future prevention, cure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mice are clearly not humans, but they have a lot in common genetically with people. And studies in mice often precede big medical breakthroughs, as &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/2011/7/4/20201973/feeling-better-say-thanks-to-the-fruit-fly-the-zebrafish-the-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/2011/7/4/20201973/feeling-better-say-thanks-to-the-fruit-fly-the-zebrafish-the-mouse/"&gt;Deseret News has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While the journey from a mouse study to a treatment or cure for people is a long one, two recent rodent studies hint at potential ways to reverse the damage of Alzheimer’s or prevent it from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Northwestern University research suggests the damage starts earlier than previously believed and is linked to “a hidden toxic protein in the brain,” as a press release on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222080119.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222080119.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt; noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Scientists found that an experimental drug, NU-9, blocks this early damage in mice and reduces inflammation linked to disease progression. The treatment was given before symptoms appeared, targeting the disease at its earliest stage. Researchers say this approach could reshape how Alzheimer’s is prevented and treated,” per the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Another study by University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center indicates “severe drops in the brain’s energy supply help drive Alzheimer’s disease — and restoring that balance can reverse damage, even in advanced cases. In mouse models, treatment repaired brain pathology, restored cognitive function, and normalized Alzheimer’s biomarkers. The results offer fresh hope that recovery may be possible," per another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032354.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032354.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If every step in between goes perfectly and the findings hold up, these studies offer hope for the future. But they are very early findings and there’s a lot to test and prove or disprove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Memory-problems-could-also-be-linked-to-old-lead-pollution" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Memory problems could also be linked to old lead pollution &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Some of today’s cognitive issues might be traced back to “historic pollution levels from the era of leaded gasoline” a half century ago, according to a news release for a study presented this summer at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from Florida State University have reported that half the older U.S. population was exposed to high lead levels in childhood, per their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study found older adults who grew up in areas with moderate to very high historical atmospheric lead levels were 20% more likely to report memory problems 50 years later, compared to those who grew up in areas with less lead pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A 2025 study reported at the conference found evidence that living within three miles of a lead-polluting site can pose risk for memory, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxPTDQweGo1WjVCVFo5UGVsQ0xrNUF0V0hhRkNZd2wwNkRwSmdjSDNtelM4bmwtTm1oYkNGRGRaTll3RDB3N2k5alNCNktOY3lfbGp1Y0RoMExfX1MxR21mWUliTkI4bnlSUVlIaWdhRnlLZEJtY0tvX3B1Y2kyT09yOUtDbXpZSnNHLXcyMXluWWx2U0NkY1h1cFg2eC1EaW5VNTdrN1FZeVFwU0owZFVDVTNZQnFSVl84ak5CeWZR</guid></item><item><title>一位营养师连续一周每天都吃鸡蛋-这是她感到惊讶的地方- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/dietitian-ate-eggs-every-day-143200202.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;I Ate Eggs Every Day for a Week&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I’ve watched with professional excitement as the nutritional tide has turned for eggs. For years, yolks were vilified, but new evidence has brought them back into favor, with the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/08/15/are-eggs-good-for-you-or-not" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; now suggesting that healthy individuals can include up to one whole egg per day as part of a heart-healthy diet. So when my editor asked me to eat one egg every day for a week and report back any key findings, I was happy to take on the challenge. My goal was to explore the experience firsthand and see how it felt to intentionally add this nutritional powerhouse to my daily routine every single day for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I started the week by hard-boiling a batch of eggs and keeping them shelled in the fridge for a quick grab-and-go snack. One morning, I opted for scrambled eggs instead. Another day, I added an egg to a bowl of ramen, letting it poach gently in the hot broth. I tried to incorporate eggs in ways that fit naturally into my meals, whether as the star of breakfast or as an addition to lunch or dinner—keeping it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate an egg every day for a week?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading into this week, I was curious to see if I would notice any changes. After reflecting on my experience, the most significant takeaway was that my energy levels stayed steady throughout the day, and I felt fewer hunger pangs. I attribute this to the high-quality protein found in eggs. I didn’t encounter any digestive issues—or really any issues at all! It was business as usual during my week-long egg-eating experiment, just with the added benefits of more consistent energy and reduced hunger, which I consider a win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment also made me more mindful of hidden ingredients. Since I aimed to stick to the “one egg per day” rule, I found myself double-checking whether foods like pancakes or baked goods already contained eggs. It was a good reminder of how often eggs sneak into our diets without us realizing it. That said, I suspect I unintentionally exceeded my "one egg a day" limit due to these hidden sources. Because of this, I’ll likely ease up on eggs in the week following the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising benefits was a noticeable reduction in daily stress. To be clear, it’s not as though eating an egg instantly melted away my anxiety. Rather, having a high-quality protein source readily available in the fridge simplified mealtime decisions. There was no need to thaw frozen chicken or beef or plan ahead to marinate anything. This convenience cut down on prep time and mental effort. Adding a quick protein to a salad or soup became an easy, automatic choice, which helped reduce decision fatigue. It highlighted how much of a difference simple, accessible ingredients can make in streamlining the daily routine of meal preparation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health benefits of eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond my personal experience, eggs offer a wealth of scientifically backed health benefits. They are a true nutritional powerhouse, packed into a small, affordable package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;High-quality protein&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the high-quality protein and nutrients in eggs that, along with a balanced diet and regular exercise, help to support all 600+ muscles in your body and overall health. Eggs are a complete protein source, providing all of the amino acids the body can’t make on its own. Plus, egg protein has been said to be highly digestible, with the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9316657/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highest attainable protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highest attainable protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score&lt;/a&gt; (PDCAAS). The PDCAAS score is so high that food scientists often use eggs as a standard to assess the protein quality of other foods. So, whatever your protein goals are, reaching for that carton of eggs is one of your best bets to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brain health support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are rich in choline, which is a nutrient that's crucial for brain health and is just one reason eggs are a smart choice! In fact, eggs are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12538690/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:among the highest sources of choline in the American diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;among the highest sources of choline in the American diet&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that supports brain health at every stage of life. Choline is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6259877/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crucial nutrient;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;crucial nutrient &lt;/a&gt;for supporting brain development, memory, and mood, and one that 90% of Americans don't get enough of. With 150 milligrams of choline per egg, that’s about &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27% of the daily requirement for men and 35% for women per egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;27% of the daily requirement for men and 35% for women per egg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits don’t stop there! Eggs are also a source of many other&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667009725000284" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health-supporting nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; brain health-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, like vitamin B12, iodine, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34063827/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lutein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lutein&lt;/a&gt;, and high-quality protein, nutrients that may support brain health and cognitive function. And here’s the golden rule: don’t skip the yolk! Nearly half of an egg’s protein and most of its vitamins and minerals (including choline, lutein, and B12) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6470839/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are found in the yolk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;are found in the yolk&lt;/a&gt;. Adding eggs to your meal rotation isn’t just a smart move; it’s a no-brainer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eye health support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lutein found in the yolk supports brain health, as mentioned above. But it is also an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in eye health. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8874683/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lutein, along with another compound called zeaxanthin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lutein, along with another compound called zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt;, both found in egg yolks, accumulate in the retina and may help protect the eyes from harmful blue light and reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/eye-health-information/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:age-related macular degeneration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD), a condition that can lead to vision challenges as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immune system support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong immune system relies on a steady supply of key vitamins and minerals, and eggs can help you meet those needs. They are a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308613/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of many immune health-supporting nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;source of many immune health-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, including selenium and zinc, two minerals essential for immune function. Eggs are also one of the few natural food sources of vitamin D, a critical nutrient that plays a role in regulating immune responses. A single egg provides about 6% of the daily value for vitamin D, contributing to your body’s overall defense system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Egg nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a breakdown of the approximate nutritional value of one large (50g) egg, according to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/748967/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture (USDA);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 72&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 6.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total Fat: 4.8 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturated Fat: 1.6 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol: 186 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium: 71 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D: 44 IU (6% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A: 270 IU (5% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin (B2): 0.2 mg (15% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12: 0.4 mcg (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selenium: 15.4 mcg (28% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline: 147 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all—eggs are also a powerhouse of antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should avoid eggs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eggs are a healthy choice for most people, they aren’t suitable for everyone. Individuals with an egg allergy, which is one of the more common food allergies in children, should avoid them completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, people with high cholesterol or a risk of heart disease were advised to limit eggs due to the dietary cholesterol in the yolk. However, current research suggests that for generally healthy people, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/08/25/heres-the-latest-on-dietary-cholesterol-and-how-it-fits-in-with-a-healthy-diet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary cholesterol has a minimal impact on blood cholesterol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary cholesterol has a minimal impact on blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. The American Heart Association notes that healthy individuals can include up to one whole egg per day in a heart-healthy dietary pattern. Those with existing heart conditions should consult their doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating an egg a day into my routine turned out to be a simple yet impactful experiment. Not only did it highlight the versatility and convenience of this nutrient-packed food, but it also reinforced how small, intentional changes can make a big difference in daily life. From steady energy levels to reduced decision fatigue, eggs proved to be more than just a breakfast staple—they became a reliable ally in my busy schedule. Plus, knowing I was fueling my body with high-quality protein and essential nutrients like choline and lutein made the experience all the more rewarding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE4tSGV3anZaSUg2VDA2R183c21xcmczREk1OGhLYmVoWl9SOXZrODJuTEcybWJTaGVxZjhoSk1GWXltMmxOeFRBUmRack1WaWRkRzdQUUpUQ1NvU1d1TktzZ3M3TFEzQkp3R0kwclFqeXFGRGpOYXFodFlNX1U</guid></item><item><title>如果您的新年决心是多运动，那么如何在家里每天走10000步- NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/shopping-deals/2025/12/how-to-walk-10000-steps-a-day-at-home-if-your-new-years-resolution-is-to-exercise-more.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="shopping-disclaimer"&gt;If you purchase a product through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RCJCPVBOT5FRFKU75CTHM7VKGE"&gt;Doesn’t it always feel like we craft New Year’s resolutions with Olympic-level enthusiasm, care and attention in December, but then let those ambitions slide down the drain when January comes around and real life kicks back in? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UG54NIMZFRGXVMJ4MLZKALFCNY"&gt;The “I will lose X pounds by Y date” or the “I will have my cholesterol numbers down by the spring” predictions sound great in theory, but they’re harder to come by in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BIPRQGCGZREDTC3FWOVLEFQEHI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/shopping-deals/2025/12/fitbit-vs-apple-watch-which-one-should-you-get.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nj.com/shopping-deals/2025/12/fitbit-vs-apple-watch-which-one-should-you-get.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fitbit vs. Apple Watch: Which one should you get?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SCG35W34PZDXDLKZ3BEVRUJIN4"&gt;Rigid goals are usually the first things to dissolve when life, stress, weather or pure exhaustion inevitably wins.

The &lt;strong&gt;benefits of choline&lt;/strong&gt; are wide-ranging: “It affects muscle contraction, heart function, pain signaling, mood, memory, and overall cognitive performance,” explains &lt;a href="https://nicolettepace.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicolette M. Pace;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicolette M.

Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutrition Now says choline is “surprisingly overlooked,” noting that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6259877/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:approximately 90% of Americans aren’t getting enough of it;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;approximately 90% of Americans aren’t getting enough of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the benefits of choline and how to increase the amount you’re getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is choline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choline is an essential nutrient that your body needs to function properly,” Manaker explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a water-soluble compound that is often grouped with B-complex vitamins because of their similarities, though it is not technically a vitamin or a mineral,” she says. “Think of it as a fundamental building block for your overall health.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s research indicating that choline benefits your cardiovascular health, your brain health, and potentially, your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease (particularly a stroke).&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients &lt;/em&gt;in 2023, a higher dietary choline intake was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534328/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers noted that people who consumed more dietary choline were less likely to have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It can improve cognitive function in older adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12482226/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research published in 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research published in 2025&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate to high dietary intakes of choline may be associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in adults aged 60 and older. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10025538/#s12" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific review&lt;/a&gt; found that choline supplements were associated with improved cognitive performance and blood vessel health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It may help manage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320186/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was lower in both women and men of normal weight who had high levels of choline intake. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40838115/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Another study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2025 found that choline supplementation in NAFLD patients had a favorable impact on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and lipid profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker explains that your liver can make small amounts of this nutrient, but not enough to meet your daily needs, meaning you need to get choline from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the average daily recommended amounts of choline varies based on age and sex. Here’s how much adults generally need: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women 19 and older: 425 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men 19 and older: 550 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women: 425 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding women 550 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are good sources of choline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs are the most common dietary source, with the choline found exclusively in the yolk—two whole eggs provide more than half the daily requirement,” says Pace. “Other sources include meats, fish such as salmon and cod, and dairy products like milk and yogurt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker also mentions plant-based options like soybeans, potatoes, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how much choline is in each of these foods, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One large hard-boiled egg: 147 milligrams (About 35% of the daily value for an adult woman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef liver (3 oz): 356 milligrams (83% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braised beef top (3 oz): 117 milligrams (28% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roasted chicken breast (3 oz): 72 milligrams (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked Atlantic cod (3 oz): 71 milligrams (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked quinoa (1 cup): 43 milligrams (10% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1% fat milk (1 cup): 43 milligrams (10% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiled Brussels sprouts (1/2 cup): 32 milligrams (8% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiled broccoli (1/2 cup): 31 milligrams (7% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked shiitake mushrooms (1/2 cup): 27 milligrams (6% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take a choline supplement?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dietitian, I usually recommend a ‘food first’ approach,” says Manaker. “Most people can meet their needs through a varied diet. However, there are specific groups who might need a supplement. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals have higher choline needs to support the baby’s brain development. Strict vegetarians or vegans might also struggle to get enough since the richest sources are animal-based. People with certain genetic variations may also require more choline.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:08:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNR3ZlTnFJdUlLOTRidEtrRmxqeG5PakhiRUVJb1g2c1c2SE1WWFpIZjJlN05oV1hEY2tORWRUR28tVGdSOGV3TVV0TVlCOG9DTlNvYldTS0U1TTluWnJKUUxQd0lYUldDMlFXanFHUXItV3l0TXp5cDk3OC1EQ1lQRGxQOWZrSV94ZHc3aA</guid></item><item><title>2025年五大最可怕和最引人入胜的医疗案例- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/the-top-5-most-horrifying-and-fascinating-medical-cases-of-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Humans accidentally get infected by eating raw vegetables containing or contaminated by infected slugs or snails, or by eating undercooked creatures that eat slugs or snails, such as land crabs, freshwater prawns, or frogs. In the woman’s case, doctors suspected she got infected from eating raw seafood and salads on a recent trip to Hawaii, where the parasite is a known threat. Luckily, the woman was treated for the infection and made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s not every day a person gets drunk and wakes up with a medical case so enigmatic that a master clinician with an expertise in medical reasoning is called in to help crack it. But a 36-year-old did just that in a case published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man showed up at the hospital with abdominal pain, a crackling in his lungs, bacteria in his blood, liver abnormalities, an injury in his small intestine, and a blood clot in his right kidney—and no clear idea of how any of those things happened or how they were connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case report, doctors lay out how they identified all of the aspects of his condition and then how master clinician Gurpreet Dhaliwal of the University of California, San Francisco, unraveled how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a fascinating look into diagnostic sleuthing, Dhaliwal reasoned out that it all came down to beers and a toothpick. The man—who had a history of binge drinking—got drunk, ate something, and accidentally swallowed a toothpick, Dhaliwal surmised. While still drunk, the man aspirated some of the food, causing his lung infection. The toothpick, meanwhile, pierced his small intestine near his right kidney, causing the injury and the blood clot. The injury then became infected, causing sepsis and his liver abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I am a 76-year-old male who is in relatively good health. For the past six months, I have been experiencing diarrhea on and off. I initially spoke to my general physician, and he thought it could be lactose intolerance. I reduced my dairy intake, drank lactose-free milk, and took Lactaid pills before eating dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ABAR2FPEZFQ3NCE2QZXLBE2DQ"&gt;After about three to four months, this did not seem to help, and I got worse. I then saw my gastroenterologist, and he did blood tests and a gastrointestinal pathogen panel. I tested negative for celiac disease, but my general physician said that Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) and rotavirus A were detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="23JLEIBGNFGPVPTJMTDHNDT7FY"&gt;My gastroenterologist put me on oral vancomycin four times a day for 10 days. This did not work, so he put me on a longer course for another month. I am still not better. It seems like I am in a pattern of feeling OK with small regular stools for three days, then get diarrhea for two days with very loose, not quite watery stools. Then the pattern starts all over again -- three good days, then two bad days. I do not have any pain or nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZEFIACG5W5CWJGZSXOXDX3FDVE"&gt;What do you think this could be, and what can I do to get over this? -- J.V.F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MV6NINWRL5GGZENVW74RNTNC3I"&gt;ANSWER: C. diff is an uncommon but quite serious cause of diarrhea, and it is often associated with antibiotics. (Amoxicillin is the most common, while clindamycin is the “classic” cause, but almost all antibiotics can be associated with the development of C. diff.) It is also associated with hospital stays. It can happen spontaneously in the community as well, which seems to be the case with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RTXQBD6SPZDEHBN6WFM362HNN4"&gt;C. diff is notoriously difficult to treat. It’s very likely that you failed the treatment with vancomycin, but this should be confirmed with another stool test, as there are many other possibilities. The GI pathogen panel can sometimes produce a false positive, so a dedicated C. diff test should be done before proceeding if it hasn’t already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JSR64DMBPFAAZO5OPQJE6I5NFM"&gt;Vancomycin has been one of the most effective treatments for C. diff, but still, initial failure rates are 10-15%. Thirty-day success rates are as low as 56% with vancomycin. Because of this, expert groups have changed the recommendation for treatment to fidaxomicin (Dificid), which has a 30-day success rate of 87%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V3UTM3SVNJHTNKDQAHEBTTVPSE"&gt;Since vancomycin did not work for you, fidaxomicin would be the next recommended regimen. Unfortunately, it is quite expensive, with a 10-day course of treatment costing somewhere around $4,000 in United States retail pharmacies. (Prescription savings programs like GoodRx can make this as low as $1,300.) Some insurance companies won’t pay for fidaxomicin unless a person has failed with vancomycin, as you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LXTDVDHUAJFJLOH35OKH66UJIQ"&gt;People who fail with fidaxomicin should be seen by an expert in infectious disease. Longer courses of vancomycin or fidaxomicin can be tried before considering a fecal microbiota transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: Your recent column noted that a few people need to take antibiotics before dental procedures to prevent a prosthetic knee infection.

This is a different issue than a person with a knee replacement or a person who has heart abnormalities, in whom antibiotics are less recommended than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7ONNQQGPSRC6BD47VGNGEAPQUU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Can you pass this 4-move strength check at 60? Try it and see how you stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: Aging has a reputation problem. It’s a misconception that, after 60, your strength, balance, and physical abilities inevitably decline. But that’s not necessarily the case, and we’re here to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While muscle mass, bone density, and strength can decline with age (a condition called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10235889/" target="_blank"&gt;rate of decline is significantly influenced&lt;/a&gt; by the way you move, how often you train, and whether your workouts challenge the right muscles and movement patterns that matter most for daily life. In fact, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1500915/full" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows even moderate physical activity can reduce your sarcopenia risk by 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the strongest predictors of longevity and independence in older adults have nothing to do with how much weight you can lift in a gym. Instead, they come down to whether you can perform a handful of fundamental movements, such as standing up from a chair, pushing your body off the ground, climbing stairs, and stabilizing your trunk. These are more “life skills” than traditional gym exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out which four essential moves reveal your body’s overall strength at 60, we spoke with &lt;b&gt;James Brady&lt;/b&gt;, personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbrady/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who tells us, “Together, these four movements challenge strength, stability, and cardiovascular effort in a way that translates directly to real life. If you can train these exercises consistently at 60, your body is not just keeping up with your age, it is outperforming it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the exercises and explanations. When you’re finished, check out &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-time-after-50-strong-core/" target="_blank"&gt;If You Can Hold a Plank This Long After 50, Your Core Is Stronger Than Most Athletes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="squat" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KmY44Xsg2w?si=biTlO7SA1Oq4I34n" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This classic lower-body movement closely mirrors one of the most common daily tasks: standing up from a seated position. That seemingly simple action relies on coordinated strength from your legs, glutes, and core, along with joint mobility. “Squats are one of the most effective full body exercises for burning calories and maintaining independence as you age,” says Brady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex your core and keep your chest upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower as far as you can while maintaining control and upright posture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to return to standing without locking your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 to 12 reps, resting for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="push-ups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDIpL0pjun0?si=-3M5xbcphBcO0Pla" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push-ups are an excellent indicator of upper-body and core strength because they require you to control your entire body as one unit, which becomes increasingly important as coordination and muscle mass deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Push-ups can be done on the floor, on knees, or elevated on a bench or wall,” explains Brady. “When done correctly, they can help build upper body strength through the chest, shoulders, arms, and core, all of which tend to decline with age if not trained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor, bench, or wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your legs or position your knees depending on the chosen variation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for three sets of 8 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="step-ups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfhXnLILqdk?si=OJAptbSXxEZX3WOd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are a true test of your lower-body strength, balance, and coordination. That’s because they mimic climbing stairs, a daily task that becomes increasingly challenging for many adults as they age, often due to weakness rather than joint issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Step ups improve leg strength, balance, and coordination, which are all crucial for staying active and injury free in later life,” Brady says. “They also work large muscle groups and elevate your heart rate quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy step or platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place one foot fully on the step, keeping your weight centered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through the heel of your front foot to lift your body upward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the trailing foot onto the step without pushing off excessively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back down with control and repeat before switching legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 reps per leg, resting 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="plank" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvIjsG5Svck?si=ofktrdk75J7enCnJ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the plank may look static, it’s one of the most effective ways to evaluate your core endurance and stability. Brady explains that “Planks strengthen the deep core muscles that support posture, protect the spine, and make all other movements more efficient. A stronger core also helps you train harder overall, which indirectly supports fat loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your legs behind you while balancing on your toes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid sagging through the hips or lifting them too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the position while breathing steadily and maintaining alignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for 20 to 40 seconds for three sets. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrh81ji00003b6sszm8d3gh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the second year in a row, the US has surpassed 25,000 whooping cough cases — another sign of the risks of falling vaccination levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhkx10000f3b6snqjym64e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often called the “100-day cough,” whooping cough or pertussis begins with cold-like symptoms such as runny nose, fever or cough that can progress to coughing fits that last weeks or months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; A “whoop” sound when coughing may appear in the second phase of illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrjs424000u3b6scm85j5ri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infection can lead to severe illness or death, especially in young children: About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 who have whooping cough requires &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;care in a hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Still, experts believe that much of the disease goes unrecognized and unreported, the CDC says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00033b6nwbgwl0xp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC reported nearly 28,000 cases this year, an elevated level after a peak last year, when the agency reported 35,493 cases. One year earlier, in 2023, there were only 7,063 cases reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhss78000i3b6svqy7jcc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;The last time&lt;/a&gt; numbers were similarly high was 2014, when there were 32,971 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhbeng00043b6svyc8j44o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirteen deaths from pertussis have been reported in the US this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization, most of them children under 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyzhjid00023b6qvst3qogq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise in whooping cough is not unique to the US, according to the Pan American Health Organization, which serves as the World Health Organization’s office for the Americas region. Last year, 977,000 cases of pertussis were reported to WHO, a five-fold increase over 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00043b6nljyrmeom@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine, believes the US rise is driven by falling vaccination rates along with a loss of population-wide immunity during the Covid-19 pandemic, among other factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00053b6ntrk78x4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worry vaccine hesitancy is playing a role. This is a vaccine-preventable illness, and any decline in vaccine rates will lead to increases in pertussis,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl3alp00033b6qltcks1gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; routine diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccination for all infants and children under 7 through a five-dose series beginning at 2 months of age. Children who get all five doses of the DTaP vaccine on schedule are 98% protected from illness within the year after the last dose. About 70% of children are fully protected five years after getting the last dose, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/types.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00063b6ni0fundth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults and adolescents are urged to get a booster Td or Tdap vaccination every 10 years, starting at the age of 11 or 12, to maintain protection. Roberts recommends choosing the version that protects against pertussis — Tdap — when possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00073b6n2zcuefse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Last year, we had a lot of college outbreaks. What happens is, a lot of people get their childhood vaccine series, and then they don’t get the booster series,” Roberts said. He noted that many of those outbreaks were driven by students who had lost their immunity and were living in group settings where the disease spreads easily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00083b6npxcr43oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A return to shared indoor spaces after the pandemic may have also contributed to the increase, he said.

            There had been limited exposure to routine pathogens because of Covid-19 mitigation measures, he said, but now “a greater proportion of people are getting exposed to the pathogen, all at the same time. I wonder if there is some degree of loss of population immunity that we’re still recovering from, and maybe things will [stabilize] over the next few years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

In 2021, coverage rates were at 87% for the first dose and 81% for the third dose of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Roberts emphasizes the importance of pertussis vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk124v00153b6sz82gw2pl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-during-pregnancy.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends a Tdap booster between weeks 27 and 36 of pregnancy, regardless of prior vaccination timing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk0vby00123b6sun44pkay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a pregnant woman gets the vaccine, “the mom is going to develop antibodies [against pertussis],” Roberts said. These antibodies “spread through the placenta and get to the baby. When the baby’s born, they’ll have some immunity from that placenta.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk18hb00183b6sqbui1r1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, maternal antibodies “wane over a couple of months,” Roberts said, underscoring the need for children to complete the DTaP &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Whooping cough symptoms and treatment
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfpad500003b6n4u5qwt5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whooping cough differs from flu, Covid-19 and the common cold in that it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, although early symptoms can look nearly identical, said Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000h3b6nyqo8dkg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even though it can look like a viral respiratory infection, it’s actually a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, and it’s got some very characteristic features,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000k3b6n1llnma0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A week or two into the illness, some people may have a characteristic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB70izafC1Y" target="_blank"&gt;whoop&lt;/a&gt; when trying to catch their breath between heavy fits of coughing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000l3b6ngbpxi35q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If coughing becomes severe, Doron said, patients may have what’s called post-tussive emesis: “vomiting when you cough or after you cough, and then the whooping sounds that also follow a coughing spell.” She advises people to see a doctor if they have severe worsening cough with symptoms such as vomiting or the whooping sound.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl91ho00093b6q5lfvi5yo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These severe symptoms result from airway damage caused by the bacterial toxin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000n3b6nxxqea09y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antibiotics are the main treatment for whooping cough. When started early in the illness, Doron explained, medications can “break the chain of transmission” and lessen contagiousness, but they “do not change the course of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000o3b6nnocjk4lk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because pertussis rapid tests&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;can be hard to find in clinics, Roberts said, health care providers often prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitlxbo9000t3b6qvr1eowu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s pretty simple to do a five-day course of azithromycin – it’s called a Z-pak – that, in almost all cases, is just going to kill the pertussis right away,” he said. Given the cost and logistics of testing, “Most of the time, [doctors] will say, ‘let’s do the Z-pak and see how it goes.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixdkyai00003b6qme2dlz0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children and infants are especially at risk of severe illness, and certain symptoms should signal when whooping cough becomes an emergency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl8h9600073b6q37szspj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signs of shortness of breath, such as a child struggling to catch their breath or a baby’s skin turning blue, require immediate medical care. Infants are at higher risk of severe illness because their respiratory and immune systems are still developing, but severe cases are rare when children have been vaccinated, Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk1g7s001b3b6skd0txjsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, health officials in South Carolina urged residents to ensure that they’re up-to-date on vaccinations amid a “concerning uptick” in cases of measles, whooping cough and chickenpox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrka27g001m3b6szm3kd2sf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The unfortunate increase in these diseases is linked to declining vaccination coverage in that region and, frankly, across the state,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist and Health Programs Branch director, said of the Upstate region’s large ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/health/measles-surge-us-south-carolina"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrka27g001n3b6si8ym6ln6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This trend is both preventable and reversible,” Bell said in a news release. “Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have for protecting our communities. When people choose not to vaccinate, outbreaks become more likely. Choosing not to vaccinate can not only put yourself at risk but also your neighbors, loved ones, and others in and beyond your community.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz000z3b6nssb6d14w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Local health departments across the country have noticed declining vaccination rates. Dr. Raynard Washington, director of Mecklenburg County Public Health in North Carolina, said the county usually saw one or two whooping cough cases annually before numbers spiked to 68 in 2024. By October 2025, the county had recorded 48 cases this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00103b6ncfa6vvto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve certainly seen an uptick here, particularly in younger children,” Washington said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitli3tj000i3b6qbml6cwd4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many cases are among those not up to date on the five-dose childhood series, and there are often clusters in communities where families delay or decline vaccines. “It does put more people in those neighborhoods at risk,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00113b6n8m1gs4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older adults are also a concern, he added, given their more vulnerable immune systems. He recommends that grandparents and other older adults “talk to their providers about anything they can do to protect themselves.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00123b6nweyoxv5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phil Huang, director and health authority of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas, said the county had 40 cases in 2023, 160 in 2024 and at least 195 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00133b6nvllvej0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;, kindergarten vaccination rates against pertussis were estimated to have dropped from almost 94% in the 2023–24 school year to less than 90% in 2024–25 in Dallas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00153b6nw15ucfj3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang said the best thing parents can do is to ensure that their children are fully vaccinated. “That’s the best protection that we can do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitlkzbe000m3b6q0cabxjlq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts added that families should monitor local public health department websites for nearby cases, which may affect how doctors approach cold- or flu-like symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00173b6nwulzgyuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If parents are concerned or the symptoms just aren’t going away after a couple weeks, you know that’s a time to come in and go see your doctor,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Crunches not working anymore? Do these 4 joint-friendly moves and feel your lower belly tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;When you think of “belly-flattening” exercises, what most likely comes to mind are crunches. Lie down, curl up, repeat. But after 45, many people notice that crunches stop delivering results, so they begin looking for other exercises to help tone their midsection. Fortunately, &lt;em&gt;ETNT&lt;/em&gt; is here to help. We spoke with &lt;b&gt;James Brady&lt;/b&gt;, personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbrady/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who serves up his most-recommended bodyweight moves designed specifically to help blast away abdominal fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-belly fat becomes more stubborn with age for several reasons: changes in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94189-2" target="_blank"&gt;hormone levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1094075/full" target="_blank"&gt;gradual loss of muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4880121/" target="_blank"&gt;reduced insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9374375/" target="_blank"&gt;lower daily energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s crucial to note that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://hummov.awf.wroc.pl/A-proposed-model-to-test-the-hypothesis-of-exercise-induced-localized-fat-reduction,143162,0,2.html" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that spot reduction of body fat isn’t possible. Instead, flattening your lower belly depends on enhancing your body’s calorie burning engine by building and maintaining lean muscle through strength exercises and training your core to support posture and better movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For adults over 45, weight loss exercise should focus on safety, muscle retention, and consistency,” says Brady. “Simple bodyweight movements, when done correctly and regularly, meet all three criteria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep reading for the exercises and detailed instructions. When you’re finished, be sure to check out these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-strength-exercises-fight-muscle-loss-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;5 Standing Strength Exercises That Reverse Muscle Loss Faster Than the Gym After 45&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="chair-squats" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chair Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GIz1C3yfE1s?si=ZjNGoZd1KHzA-rpd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chair squats are one of the most underrated exercises for fat loss and core engagement after 45. While they primarily strengthen the legs and glutes, they also require the core to brace the torso throughout the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brady explains that “Chair squats are an effective lower body exercise that strengthen the legs and glutes while mimicking everyday movements like sitting down and standing up,” explains Brady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of a chair with your feet about shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brace your core and keep your chest upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and begin lowering toward the chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly tap the chair with your glutes without fully sitting down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to stand back up with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for 10 to 12 reps across two to three sets, resting for 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="wall-push-ups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wall Push-Ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOf3cGIQpA4?si=jqhYckzbwoRiGs0d" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall push-ups are a joint-friendly way to strengthen your upper body while engaging your core. Unlike floor push-ups or crunches, this variation helps avoid back strain while still burning calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wall push ups build upper-body strength in the chest, shoulders, and arms while being gentle on the wrists and shoulders,” says Bady. “They also increase muscle engagement, which helps raise daily energy expenditure and supports fat loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a wall and place your hands on it at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back slightly so your body forms a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to prevent arching through your lower back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete two to three sets of eight to 12 reps. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="step-backs" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step Backs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step backs (sometimes called reverse lunges) are a stellar lower-body exercise that improves balance, coordination, and calorie burn without harming your knees. “Step backs activate the glutes and legs while improving balance and coordination,” explains Brady. “They burn calories while placing less stress on the knees than forward lunges, making them ideal for adults over 45.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips or at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one foot back and lower your hips slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your front knee aligned over your toes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain an upright torso and engaged core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through the front heel to return to standing before switching legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform two to three sets of six to 10 reps per leg, resting for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing marches are deceptively effective for flattening the lower belly because they combine low-impact cardio with active core engagement. Additionally, they train your abs to stabilize your pelvis while your legs move, which is exactly how your core actually functions in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brady describes them as “a low impact cardio exercise that elevates the heart rate and improves hip mobility.” He adds that standing marches “are an effective way to increase calorie burn while supporting posture and core engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your shoulders relaxed and your core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee toward hip height while maintaining balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the foot with control and switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue marching at a steady, controlled pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March for 30 to 45 seconds across two to three rounds. Rest for 30 to 45 seconds between rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why These Work Better Than Crunches After 45&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunches primarily train one movement pattern and do little to increase overall calorie burn. After 45, fat loss depends more on building and maintaining muscle mass, keeping your joints healthy, and working out consistently. The exercises above work because they combine full-body movement, core stabilization, and cardiovascular demand without harming your joints. Over time, doing these exercises regularly can lead to better posture, higher daily calorie burn, and a stronger, more functional core, thereby paving the path for a flatter lower belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They call him the “cutest dog ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Little puppy unwraps Christmas present and finds new squeaky toy inside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-reacts-mom-hanging-124017130.html" data-ylk="slk:cute dog video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;cute dog video&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, a little puppy gently unwraps his Christmas present. It begins with a Jack Russell Terrier named Kobe wagging his tail in excitement when his dog mom gives him a gift. She tells the pup that his “Mummy and Daddy” have a Christmas present for him. Then, the woman gives something wrapped in green festive wrapping paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kobe gladly accepts the gift, holding it in his mouth. In the background, his dog dad cheers the fur baby, chanting, “Open! Open!” Meanwhile, Kobe starts to tear the wrapper slowly. Without losing patience, he unwraps the present calmly till each paper falls on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although the dog dad tries to help the pet, Kobe seems to be doing fine on his own after a while. Throughout the unwrapping process, the pet parents don’t stop cheering their pooch.

Despite negotiated price reductions announced in November that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;the White House said&lt;/a&gt; would “dramatically lower cost to taxpayers” for the drugs and enable Medicaid to cover them, states are going ahead with the cuts, which providers say may undermine patient health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be quite negative for our patients” because data show people typically regain weight after stopping the drugs, said &lt;a class="link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/diana.thiara" target="_blank"&gt;Diana Thiara&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of the UC San Francisco Weight Management Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although California and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nhhealthyfamilies.com/newsroom/glp-1-medications-change-in-coverage-effective-january-1--2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; will not cover GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity beginning Jan. 1, they will continue to cover the drugs for other health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://bridgemi.com/michigan-health-watch/michigan-limits-access-to-weight-loss-drugs-for-medicaid-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, &lt;a class="link" href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/10/10/rhode-island-considers-ending-medicaid-coverage-of-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, South Carolina and Wisconsin are planning or considering restrictions, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s most recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/50-state-medicaid-budget-survey-fy-2025-2026/#5fdff9dc-c0ed-45f2-97aa-c20d45a3ab5d:~:text=and%2520medication%2520misuse.-,Coverage%2520of%2520Obesity%2520Drugs,-Sixteen%2520state%2520Medicaid" target="_blank"&gt;survey of state Medicaid programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reverses a trend that saw 16 states covering the medications for obesity as of Oct. 1. Interest in providing the coverage “appears to be waning,” the survey found,  probably because of the drugs’ cost and other state budget pressures. North Carolina pulled back GLP-1 coverage in October, but &lt;a class="link" href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/10/governor-stein-continues-stand-3-million-medicaid-patients-north-carolina-directs-ncdhhs-restore" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Josh Stein &lt;/a&gt;reinstated it in December, bowing to court orders despite a lingering budget shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine Ferguson, vice president of federal advocacy for the American Diabetes Assn. and its affiliated Obesity Assn., said it’s unclear how states will adjust to the White House plan to lower the cost of several of the most popular GLP-1s through TrumpRx, an online portal for discounted prescription drugs. The price of Wegovy, for example, will be $350 per month for consumers, versus the current list price of nearly $1,350, and Medicare and Medicaid programs will pay $245, according to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many states are facing budgetary challenges, such as deficits, and are working to address the impacts of the changes to Medicaid and SNAP,” Ferguson wrote, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “As more details become available for the Administration’s agreements, we will see how state Medicaid responds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services referred questions to the White House, which did not respond to requests for comment on states’ termination of Medicaid coverage for the weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California projected its costs to cover GLP-1s for weight loss would have more than quadrupled over four years to &lt;a class="link" href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2025-26/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/HealthandHumanServices.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;nearly $800 million annually&lt;/a&gt; if it didn’t end Medi-Cal coverage for that use. Medi-Cal has covered weight-loss drugs since 2006, but use of GLP-1s soared only in recent years. By 2024, more than 645,000 prescriptions were covered by Medi-Cal across all uses of the medications. The California Department of Health Care Services could not readily provide a breakdown of whether the drugs were for weight loss or other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether the state would reconsider its plans in light of the announced price cuts, Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said it had no plans to do so. California’s cut is written into &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB101" target="_blank"&gt;the state’s budget law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California officials would not say how much it could save under the TrumpRx plan, citing federal and state restrictions on disclosing rebate information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers don’t expect the Trump administration’s negotiated price cuts to make much difference to consumers, because pharmaceutical companies already offer discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The out-of-pocket costs will still be very cost-prohibitive for most, especially individuals with Medicaid insurance,” Thiara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://nh.primetherapeutics.com/documents/51139/51630/Notification%252010.09.2025%2520-%2520GLP-1%2520Coverage%2520Change/218c7285-7968-9484-a244-859e0741eeba" target="_blank"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; will also end its coverage Jan. 1. Officials with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 8 adults are taking a GLP-1 drug for obesity, disease or both, up 6 percentage points from May 2024, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-prescription-drug-costs-views-on-trump-administration-actions-and-glp-1-use/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF poll results&lt;/a&gt; released in November. More than half of users said their GLP-1s were difficult to afford, and many who had stopped the treatment cited the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public and private payers have been trying to &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/glp-1-weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-cost-deprescription-medicaid-north-carolina/" target="_blank"&gt;wean patients off&lt;/a&gt; of the drugs to save costs. California health officials said Medi-Cal members and their healthcare providers &lt;a class="link" href="https://medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/cms/medicalrx/static-assets/documents/provider/publications/2025.10_A_Important_Update_GLP-1s_Weight_Loss_Not_Covered_Benefit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;should consider&lt;/a&gt; “other treatment options that can support weight loss, such as diet changes, increased activity or exercise, and counseling.” That echoes advice from the New Hampshire Medicaid program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Department of Health Care Services spokesperson Tessa Outhyse said in an email that the official advice to try those other approaches now “is not meant to dismiss any past efforts, but to encourage Medi-Cal members to take a renewed, proactive, and medically supported approach with their healthcare provider that may appropriately include these additional options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may be unrealistic, said &lt;a class="link" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/kurt-hong/" target="_blank"&gt;Kurt Hong&lt;/a&gt;, founding director of the Center for Clinical Nutrition at Keck School of Medicine of USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely want patients to do their part with the diet and exercise, but unfortunately, and from a practical standpoint, that itself frequently is not enough,” Hong said, adding that usually by the time patients see doctors, they have failed at achieving results through those means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong understands why Medicaid programs, as well as private providers, want to cut back on covering the drugs, which can cost &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/press-release/costly-glp-1-drugs-are-rarely-covered-for-weight-loss-by-marketplace-plans/" target="_blank"&gt;thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; per patient per year. However, they can produce twice the weight loss as the medications typically used previously, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school of medical thought supports people gradually ending their use, but Hong said obesity is generally considered a chronic condition that requires indefinite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once they reach their target weight, a lot of people will try to see whether or not they can wean off,” Hong said. “We do see a lot of patients — when they try to get off, unfortunately, then the weight comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medi-Cal members younger than 21 will &lt;a class="link" href="https://medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/member/state-budget-updates/" target="_blank"&gt;remain covered&lt;/a&gt; for purposes including weight loss, California officials said, citing a federal requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medi-Cal members will be able to keep their GLP-1 coverage if they can demonstrate it is medically necessary for purposes other than weight loss, the Department of Health Care Services said. Members who are denied coverage can seek a hearing, the department said in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/cms/medicalrx/static-assets/documents/member/letters/GLP-1_Weight_Loss.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members will still be able to pay for the prescriptions out of pocket and may be able to use various discounts to lower costs. Another option is new pills to treat obesity, which will be cheaper than their injectable counterparts. The Food and Drug Administration approved a pill version of Wegovy on Dec. 22, which probably will cost $149 a month for the lowest dosage, and similar weight-loss pills are expected to be available in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Cardenas said his husband, Jeffer Jimenez, 37, uses GLP-1s primarily for weight loss, Jimenez’s prescription is for diabetes, so the couple hoped to continue receiving coverage through Medi-Cal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He tried a thousand medications, pills, natural teas, exercise program, but it doesn’t work like the injections,” Cardenas said. “You need both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thompson writes for&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;KF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;F. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPZUlraGRjTDVaTy1abkdTZVhZM2cxdlVPeEZOUFUwcnBsR0RxTjdiZXNOLUZ0VEoyX3ZOVFViYTRPb0otejBNU3JDWFpaMHJMY2pha2VhZVFSemk0Q0FwZEJrdVJiN0k3MGFCNndWS2dZNTRMTURuTkt1OFdKM2tVaVRyQTZBcVdYR1dNeFJKRXMxN2tFcm0yUXpGLXA3WXM5azZZVVoxX1FIRHZkZzlR</guid></item></channel></rss>
