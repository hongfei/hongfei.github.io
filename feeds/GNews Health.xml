The bacteria is often found in natural and man-made water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;When contaminated water is inhaled, i.e. in the shower or from air conditioning, the bacteria can enter the lungs and cause an infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The disease is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Cincinnati Health Department, Hamilton County Public Health and the Ohio Department of Health are conducting additional water tests at Christ Hospital’s main campus in response to the two cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The departments are also installing filters on faucets and showers while testing continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“As part of its standard safety practice, The Christ Hospital routinely monitors, tests, and treats its water systems to minimize the presence of Legionella and other waterborne pathogens,” The Christ Hospital Health Network wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As of now, the network says there is no indication the hospital’s water is unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The risk to patients, visitors and staff is low, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please click here to report it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "An estimated 1.4 billion adults aged 30–79 years worldwide had hypertension in 2024; this represents 33% of the population in this age range." However, high blood pressure often doesn't show clear symptoms until it is too late. "An estimated 600 million adults with hypertension (44%) are unaware that they have the condition," the WHO states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, your lifestyle-- which includes your everyday diet plays a huge role in managing it. Certain foods can help relax blood vessels, reduce sodium levels, and improve heart health, while others can silently push your blood pressure higher. Thus, making simple changes in your food habits can show great effects on your overall well-being. Here we list some of the best foods one should have and the worst foods one should avoid for high blood pressure (BP):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>显示一种膳食补充剂可减少高达28%的攻击性- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/one-dietary-supplement-was-shown-to-reduce-aggression-by-up-to-28</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression. Their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="179839" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 29 randomized controlled trials across 3,918 participants in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/angry-outbursts-could-literally-be-putting-some-peoples-heart-at-risk"&gt;Angry Outbursts Could Literally Be Putting Some People's Heart at Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all the trials, a modest but noticeable short-term effect was found, translating to up to a 28 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/venting-doesnt-reduce-anger-but-something-else-does-study-finds"&gt;reduction in aggression&lt;/a&gt; across multiple different variables (including age, gender, medical diagnosis, and length and dosage of treatment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the time has come to implement omega-3 supplementation to reduce aggression, irrespective of whether the setting is the community, the clinic, or the criminal justice system," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurocriminologist Adrian Raine when the meta-analysis was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg" alt="Flow diagram detailing steps of review process." class="wp-image-149438 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-642x495.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-538x415.jpg 538w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-600x463.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flow diagram of literature search leading to 28 suitable papers. (Raine &amp;amp; Brodrick, &lt;em&gt;Aggression and Violent Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials included in the study, carried out between 1996 and 2024, ran for an average of 16 weeks. They covered a variety of demographics, from &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12314"&gt;children aged 16 and under&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10284150290007119"&gt;older people aged between 50 and 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the reductions in aggression included both reactive aggression (in response to provocation) and proactive aggression (behavior planned in advance). Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods. (Ekaterina Kapranova/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think something in the way that omega-3 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327816302198"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and keeps vital brain processes &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3820"&gt;ticking over&lt;/a&gt; might be helping regulate aggression. There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but the team suggests there's enough evidence to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154"&gt;the studies that show&lt;/a&gt; that medications derived from fish oil can help reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks, strokes, and other heart health problems, and there seems to be plenty of upside to adding some omega-3 to your diet.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term use of melatonin supplements, often used to promote sleep and address insomnia, was associated with a higher risk of heart failure diagnosis, heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause in chronic insomnia, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body by the pineal gland, and it helps regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin levels increase during darkness and decrease during daylight. Chemically identical synthetic versions of the hormone are often used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. The supplements are widely available over the counter in many countries, including the U.S. In the U.S., over-the-counter supplements are not regulated, so each brand of supplement can vary in strength, purity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers classified people who had used melatonin long-term (with long-term use defined as a year or more documented in their electronic health records) as part of the "melatonin group." In contrast, those who never had melatonin recorded anywhere in their medical records were classified as the "non-melatonin group."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed. If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements are promoted and marketed as a safe sleep aid; however, data demonstrating their long-term cardiovascular safety are lacking, which prompted the researchers to examine whether melatonin use alters the risk of heart failure, specifically in chronic insomnia patients. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs for them to function properly and is a common condition that affects 6.7 million adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a large international database (the TriNetX Global Research Network), the researchers reviewed 5 years of electronic health records for adults with chronic insomnia who had melatonin recorded in their health records and used it for more than a year. They were matched with peers in the database who also had insomnia but never had melatonin recorded in their health records. People were excluded from the analysis if they had previously been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Among adults with insomnia, those whose electronic health records indicated long-term melatonin use (12 months or more) had about a 90% higher chance of incident heart failure over 5 years compared with matched non-users (4.6% vs. 2.7%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was a similar result (82% higher) when researchers analyzed people who had at least 2 melatonin prescriptions filled at least 90 days apart. (Melatonin is only available by prescription in the United Kingdom.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants taking melatonin were nearly 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin (19.0% vs. 6.6%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants in the melatonin group were nearly twice as likely to die from any cause than those in the non-melatonin group (7.8% vs. 4.3%, respectively) over the 5-year period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors," Nnadi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication," said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. St-Onge, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of nutritional medicine in the division of general medicine and director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research in the department of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. First, the database includes countries that require a prescription for melatonin (such as the United Kingdom) and countries that don't (such as the United States), and patient locations were not part of the de-identified data available to the researchers. Since melatonin use in the study was based only on those identified from medication entries in the electronic health record, everyone taking it as an over-the-counter supplement in the U.S. or other countries that don't require a prescription would have been in the non-melatonin group; therefore, the analyses may not accurately reflect this. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. The researchers also lacked information on the severity of insomnia and the presence of other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk," Nnadi said. "Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study included 130,828 adults (average age of 55.7 years; 61.4% women) diagnosed with insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study data was from TriNetX, established in 2013, a growing global network of real-world, de-identified patient data available for research.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;65,414 participants had been prescribed melatonin at least once and reported taking it for at least a year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A second group of people were examined for comparison (control group) - those who had never been prescribed melatonin and were matched to the group taking melatonin on 40 factors including demographic information, health conditions and medications. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants were excluded if they had already been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other types of sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The melatonin and control groups were matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, heart and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-the-Nervous-System.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; diseases, medications for heart and nervous system diseases, blood pressure and body mass index. Researchers looked at electronic medical records from the five years after the matching date.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For the main findings, records were searched for codes related to an initial diagnosis of heart failure. Secondary findings included codes for hospitalization related to heart failure or death.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Following the initial analyses, researchers validated the credibility of their findings by conducting a sensitivity analysis. This involved slightly changing the criteria: they required participants in the melatonin group to have filled at least two melatonin prescriptions that were at least 90 days apart. This adjustment aimed to determine whether the extended duration of confirmed melatonin prescriptions influenced the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a profound link between how we perceive our bodies and our ability to recall events from our personal history. This finding is the first to show that temporarily changing one’s sense of bodily self can facilitate the retrieval of remote memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was led by a team of neuroscientists at Anglia Ruskin University who were exploring the connection between the self, the body, and autobiographical memory. Our memories are not just recordings of external events; they are experiences that happened to us while we inhabited a particular body. The researchers reasoned that since our bodies change throughout our lives, the physical self we had in childhood is different from the one we have as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When our childhood memories were formed, we had a different body,” said senior author Jane Aspell, who leads the Self &amp;amp; Body Lab at Anglia Ruskin University. “So we wondered: if we could help people experience aspects of that body again, could we help them recall their memories from that time?” This question formed the basis for their experiment, which sought to see if reintroducing body-related cues from the past could help reactivate memories associated with that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers recruited 50 healthy adults for an online experiment. Participants were randomly split into two groups. In the experimental group, individuals viewed a live video of their own face that had been digitally altered with a filter to look like a childlike version of themselves. The control group viewed a live, unaltered video of their adult faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then induced what is known as an “enfacement illusion.” Participants were instructed to move their heads in time with a metronome. For both groups, the face on the screen would mirror their movements, creating a powerful sensation that the face they were seeing was their own, similar to looking in a mirror. This synchronous movement was designed to create a strong feeling of ownership over the on-screen face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the strength of the illusion, the experiment also included a condition with asynchronous movement. In this part, the face on the screen moved in the opposite direction to the participant’s head movements, which tends to weaken the feeling of ownership. After each session of head movements, participants answered a questionnaire to measure how strongly they felt that the face on the screen was their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the illusion, participants engaged in an autobiographical memory interview. While still viewing either their childlike or adult face, they were asked to recall specific events from two different time periods: their childhood (up to age 11) and the past year. The researchers provided cues like “home” or “holiday” to prompt the memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s primary interest was not just whether people could remember events, but the richness of those memories. The interviews were recorded and scored based on the level of detail provided. Specifically, the researchers distinguished between two types of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is semantic memory, which involves factual information, like the name of a place you visited. The other is episodic memory, which involves the ability to mentally re-experience an event, recalling sensory details, emotions, and the feeling of being there. This is often described as a form of mental “time travel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear difference between the two groups. Participants who experienced the illusion with their childlike face recalled significantly more episodic details about their childhood memories compared to the control group who saw their adult faces. This effect was specific to childhood memories; the illusion had no impact on the recall of recent events from the past year. It also did not affect the recall of semantic, or factual, details about childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Utkarsh Gupta, who conducted the study as part of his PhD, explained the potential mechanism behind the results. “All the events that we remember are not just experiences of the external world, but are also experiences of our body, which is always present,” he said. “We discovered that temporary changes to the bodily self, specifically, embodying a childlike version of one’s own face, can significantly enhance access to childhood memories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “This might be because the brain encodes bodily information as part of the details of an event. Reintroducing similar bodily cues may help us retrieve those memories, even decades later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted some limitations and areas for future exploration. The strength of the illusion, whether induced by synchronous or asynchronous movement, did not appear to affect the amount of memory detail recalled. This may suggest that simply viewing and identifying with the childlike face was enough to trigger the memory enhancement, a phenomenon that could be related to priming. Future studies could directly compare the embodiment illusion with a simpler priming condition, such as just looking at a static picture of a young face, to separate these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was that the digital filter was a generic approximation of a younger face, not a personalized rendering based on participants’ actual childhood photos. Future experiments in a lab setting could use more advanced technology to create more realistic and personalized younger selves, possibly strengthening the effect. Researchers also suggest that modifying the protocol to administer the illusion questionnaire after the memory interview could help avoid biasing participants’ responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings open up new possibilities for understanding memory. They suggest that the self is not a single, static entity but is fluid, and that our memories are deeply intertwined with our physical form at the time they were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are really exciting and suggest that further, more sophisticated body illusions could be used to unlock memories from different stages of our lives – perhaps even from early infancy,” said Aspell. She suggested that in the future, it might be possible to adapt these techniques “to create interventions that might aid memory recall in people with memory impairments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Illusory ownership of one’s younger face facilitates access to childhood episodic autobiographical memories&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Utkarsh Gupta, Peter Bright, Waheeb Zafar, Pilar Recarte-Perez, Alex Clarke, and Jane E.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0003356nzti48g0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was a question Dr. Gideon Lack asked often, when giving lectures to fellow allergists and pediatricians on the topic of food allergies: How many doctors in the room had a patient allergic to peanuts?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0004356nrwj3r31f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Normally, “virtually every doctor would have put up their hand,” Lack said. Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies, affecting more than 2% of US children, with a similar &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/peanut-allergy-factsheet/" target="_blank"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, where Lack was practicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0005356nbenw5p9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But at a lecture in Tel Aviv, Israel, about 25 years ago, the audience’s response took Lack by surprise. Only two or three out of about 200 raised their hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0006356nz8q0prs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said, ‘Wait, this doesn’t make sense,’ ” he recalled recently. “I was practicing in London, which has a big Jewish community, and I was seeing a high frequency of peanut allergy amongst Jewish children who share similar ancestral background.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0007356n0i6tol41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack and his colleagues’ investigations into why, which played out over the next 15 years, led to last month’s remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/peanut-allergy-guidance-change-wellness"&gt;finding&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of peanut allergies in the US – after a precipitous rise – appeared to have fallen dramatically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0008356nxbol2yoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turned out that the guidance parents and pediatricians – and Lack himself – had been following, to avoid giving peanuts to babies and young children to try to prevent the development of dangerous allergies, was completely backward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0009356nbecgiuzw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By thinking we were protecting them, we were actually causing the problem,” Lack told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000a356nup77hdz5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The story of how he and his colleagues proved that was the case is a primer in the &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/videos/the-scientific-process" target="_blank"&gt;scientific process&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000c356nehco6urw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a joke in Israel that the first three words babies learn are “mother,” “father” and “Bamba,” Lack said – for the peanut puff snacks that Israeli parents give babies when they’re very young.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000d356n2m8tlcn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve sort of become a national snack,” he noted, pointing out that the joke is actually “a truism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000e356nn1bx6z2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he had conversations with the doctors there, as well as parents of young children, “They all told me one very clear thing: ‘We give peanut snacks to our babies from between 4 and 6 months of age.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000f356nl23044wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bambas contain “vast amounts of peanut protein,” Lack said. And he came to suspect that, just by “happenstance … this product was developed in Israel and protected the Israeli population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000g356n0l3c1h2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that was an observation, something he’d learned at a lecture, Lack emphasized. “That’s not really proof of anything.” Could there be other differences Israeli children experience - weather, sunshine, vitamin D exposure - that could have contributed?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000h356ncm7bqm4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he and a team of colleagues set out to study it. They looked at about 5,000 schoolchildren in Israel and 5,000 Jewish schoolchildren in London who shared a similar ancestral background – to control for genetic differences – and compared their rates of peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000i356n4chbnj5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the UK, it was tenfold higher”: almost 2% of kids, Lack said, whereas in Israel, it “virtually didn’t exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000j356naz22rqr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Examining the children’s diets, including when peanuts were introduced in the first year of life, revealed an obvious difference: UK babies were consuming a median zero grams of peanut per week. Israeli babies were eating about 2 grams – equivalent, in Bambas form, to about 10 weekly peanuts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000k356nle88cvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kids were eating this with great relish,” Lack noted; it’s a “very popular snack.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000l356nyammts9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “at the time when I suggested this hypothesis, it was virtually impossible to get funding,” he said. He and his team turned to the &lt;a href="https://nationalpeanutboard.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Peanut Board&lt;/a&gt;, the group representing American peanut farmers. He said the study was criticized for who funded it but emphasized that it had no bearing on the outcome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000m356ndhlnsp6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea of eating peanuts was felt to be preposterous, that we would be putting babies at risk and causing peanut allergy based on the old thinking we had, and that it would even be an unethical thing to do,” he recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000n356nbjh8egus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results suggested otherwise. But&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the work was only beginning.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000p356nj098zwo9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What Lack and his colleagues had shown with that study, which was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000582/" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2008, was an &lt;em&gt;association &lt;/em&gt;between eating peanuts early in infancy and a lower likelihood of developing peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000q356nkwm14gk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What they wanted to prove was that early introduction of peanuts was the &lt;em&gt;cause &lt;/em&gt;of those reduced allergy rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000r356nj6jzhklq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that, they’d need to run a randomized controlled trial, in which they randomly separated participants – in this case, infants with severe eczema, egg allergy or both, putting them at higher risk of peanut allergy – into two groups. One set was directed to consume foods with peanut - such as Bambas peanut puffs - starting between 4 and 11 months of age, and the other was told to avoid them until they turned 5 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000s356nft4nkr3w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, Lack and his colleagues received funding from the US National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Lack called “patient and generous.” It was not an overnight result. It took two years to recruit the 640 infants into the trial, Lack said, and then they were followed for five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000t356nurmayp96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results were stark. Of the 530 kids who didn’t start out with a sensitivity to peanut, 13.7% developed peanut allergy by age 5 if they avoided peanuts. In the group that consumed peanuts starting before age 1, 1.9% developed peanut allergy. Among kids who’d shown signs of sensitivity to start with, 35.3% who avoided peanuts developed the allergy, versus 10.6% of those who ate them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000u356nitg99pjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was hoping for an effect, but I was not expecting to see a more than 80% reduction,” Lack said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000v356njoh2j59c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the biostatisticians called him and colleague Dr. George Du Toit with the results, “we toasted the good news to whiskey and roasted peanuts,” Lack recalled. They published the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;findings &lt;/a&gt;from the trial, called the LEAP study, in 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It wasn’t clear, though, whether the message would resonate with parents and pediatricians – if they could change course and do the opposite of what they’d been told for so long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000y356n3lfz2iu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920165/" target="_blank"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; had been issued in 2000 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and although they’re often described now without nuance, they were anything but definitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000z356npbcbd90q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Conclusive studies are not yet available to permit definitive recommendations,” the academy’s Committee on Nutrition wrote in a document about hypoallergenic infant formulas. For infants at high risk of developing allergies, the committee continued, “the following recommendations seem reasonable at this time” – including delaying introduction of dairy products until 1 year, eggs until 2 years and peanuts, nuts and fish until age 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0010356nwt58cge3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack himself followed the avoidance guidance with his own sons, which of course, “in retrospect, was the wrong advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0011356nc95eahk0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he emphasizes that the scientific process of proving it was the way medicine should work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0012356nlo1xv0p4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The history of medicine is a series of zigzags,” he said. “It’s not one linear, perfect progression, and people forget that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0013356n0kjzok2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6157280/#:~:text=In%202008%2C%20the%20AAP%20partially,for%20introducing%20peanut%2Dcontaining%20foods." target="_blank"&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; its guidance that said potential allergens should be avoided for high-risk babies, but didn’t have enough data to recommend introducing them early.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhf734ly0001356nf3pzsyow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the LEAP study was published in 2015, the guidance was updated in what researchers now refer to as a landmark move, and the recommendations were expanded in 2017 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0014356nmk27clxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Pediatrics found that rates of peanut allergies among US kids 3 and under declined 33% after the 2015 recommendation and fell 43% after 2017 – and peanut allergies slipped from being the most prevalent to the second-most, behind eggs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0015356n2yy7pubv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Study leader Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that those reductions, extrapolated to the number of US kids under age 3, suggest that almost 40,000 children may have avoided peanut allergy diagnoses since the guidelines changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0017356n1zf60kgk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack’s work continues. He’s currently co-leading another trial funded by the NIH, called the &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10825608" target="_blank"&gt;SEAL study&lt;/a&gt;. It seeks to test another question that once seemed backward: Could treating eczema early in a baby’s life prevent the development of food allergies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0018356n75arbqh0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For years, we used to think that food allergies cause eczema,” Lack said. “Now we know it’s the reverse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0019356nfkjih8ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is referred to as the dual-exposure hypothesis, and Hill noted that it’s supported by decades of research, including from the LEAP trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001a356np9v7aguy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early exposure to food proteins through the gut promotes tolerance, teaching the immune system that these foods are safe,” he told CNN. “In contrast, exposure through inflamed or disrupted skin – as often occurs in infants with eczema – can sensitize the immune system and increase the likelihood of developing food allergy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001b356n6pxmqr5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies might encounter food proteins through their skin if they have eczema just from their parents eating those foods, Lack said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001c356n8477qzys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He put the hypothesis another way: “If I were to knock on your front door and ask for directions, you’d probably greet me in a civil way. But if I were to break into one of the windows, you might greet me in a different way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001d356nsqyrqben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SEAL study aims to &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03742414" target="_blank"&gt;treat &lt;/a&gt;dry or red, flaky skin in the first 12 weeks of life, before babies have developed allergies, using moisturizers and topical steroids, and give babies more time to be exposed to foods by eating them. The goal: see if that helps reduce the likelihood they develop food allergies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If they’re right, it could change medicine again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

During deep rest, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through brain tissue, clearing away waste and restoring balance in neural communication. When this cycle is disrupted, the effects reach far beyond fatigue, influencing memory, focus, and emotional stability. In recent years, scientists have turned their attention to how this cleansing process is controlled and what happens when it falters. Understanding how sleep loss alters CSF movement reveals not only why mental clarity suffers after sleepless nights but also how long-term deprivation may affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does your brain do when you sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every night, while the body appears still, the brain becomes remarkably active in maintenance. CSF, a clear liquid that cushions and nourishes the brain and spinal cord, pulses through networks of neural tissue. Its main role is to remove metabolic waste such as beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which accumulate during wakefulness. These same proteins are linked to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, making efficient CSF circulation essential for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Impact of Sleep on Brain Function and Mental Well-being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, particularly in slow-wave phases, the brain’s electrical activity changes rhythmically. Neuronal firing slows, blood flow patterns shift, and the spaces between brain cells expand, allowing CSF to flow more freely. This combination of slowed activity and increased fluid movement acts as the brain’s own detoxification system. When this process is interrupted, the brain’s ability to regulate toxins and maintain functional balance becomes impaired, a disruption that researchers increasingly connect to cognitive and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lack to sleep harm your brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;recent study published in Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; used advanced imaging and electrophysiological measurements to explore how sleep deprivation affects the coupling between brain activity and CSF flow. Researchers monitored participants who underwent controlled sleep loss, measuring changes in neural oscillations, blood oxygenation, and CSF movement during subsequent rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed a striking pattern: after extended wakefulness, the natural synchronisation between brain activity and fluid circulation weakened noticeably. Under normal conditions, waves of neural activity guide CSF pulses through the brain’s ventricles in a tightly coordinated rhythm. However, when subjects were sleep-deprived, this rhythm broke down, leading to slower, less effective fluid movement. The study also recorded increased variability in blood flow across regions responsible for attention and executive function, suggesting that the consequences of disrupted CSF dynamics extend into areas governing higher-order cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that this decoupling coincided with measurable declines in reaction speed and working memory performance. Even short-term sleep loss, they noted, can reduce the brain’s metabolic clearance efficiency. These findings shed light on why lack of sleep so quickly affects focus, reasoning, and emotional control; it is not only about fatigue but also about an internal breakdown in the brain’s waste management and communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When does the brain falls out of sync&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation affects more than just the physical movement of CSF. It disrupts the delicate timing between electrical and vascular activity that keeps the brain’s systems in sync. Normally, waves of low-frequency oscillations act as signals that coordinate blood and CSF flow. When these oscillations lose their rhythm, neural communication becomes noisy and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In imaging data, this manifests as diminished coupling between deep and superficial brain regions, particularly within the prefrontal cortex—the area responsible for decision-making and attention control. The disrupted synchrony means that messages between networks arrive either too early or too late, reducing overall cognitive precision. People who have gone without sleep often experience this as “mental fog” or difficulty maintaining focus, but the physiological cause lies in impaired timing between neurons and supporting fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study found that even after a recovery night of rest, the brain’s coordination of fluid and electrical rhythms did not fully return to normal, indicating that the effects of acute deprivation can linger. This persistence suggests that the brain requires more than one night of quality sleep to fully recalibrate its internal systems after extended wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is proper sleep essential&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep and brain health extends well beyond temporary tiredness. Persistent deprivation weakens the brain’s ability to clear neurotoxic waste, allowing harmful proteins to accumulate over time. Research into neurodegenerative diseases increasingly points to chronic sleep disruption as a contributing factor in cognitive decline. While the Nature Neuroscience study focused on short-term effects, its findings align with broader evidence linking reduced CSF circulation to long-term structural changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal and parietal regions, which are most sensitive to sleep loss, also play critical roles in emotional regulation and memory consolidation. When their function is compromised, individuals may experience heightened stress reactivity, impulsivity, and forgetfulness. Moreover, impaired fluid movement may affect not only toxin clearance but also the distribution of nutrients and hormones critical for neural repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this connection has significant implications for public health. As modern lifestyles increasingly compress sleep schedules, disruptions in CSF dynamics may become more common. The findings emphasise that consistent, high-quality sleep is not simply a matter of rest but a biological necessity for maintaining the brain’s internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spilled your coffee while rushing out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You struggled to change a setting on your phone, only to give up in frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You got a bug bite, or sunburn, or stubbed your toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to stand in a long line or wait in traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone spoke (or chewed gum, or slammed a door) too loudly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone interrupted or ignored you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the kind of events that disrupt the course of your life. But they are all annoying, and sometimes bothersome enough that they could set the tone for the rest of your day. Annoying experiences like these have also been &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00844845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; ‘micro-stresses’ or ‘daily hassles’. They usually come your way unexpectedly, cause you some stress, and interrupt your flow. Though they are minor compared with, say, a personal attack, an injury or a significant loss, I’ve seen in my work as a psychologist how often people struggle to tolerate annoying things or underestimate their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite likely that you’ve been told ‘don’t sweat the small stuff’ and ‘focus on the bigger picture’. Despite our best efforts, though, many of us sometimes find it hard to shrug off the lingering emotional effect of an annoying experience. Making it worse, you might judge yourself for not being able to just let it go. Even if a particular stressor seems insignificant on its own, annoying experiences can have a cumulative effect. Like drops filling a bucket, they can eventually spill over until you’re suddenly snapping at someone, or &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;tearing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that accumulated stressors might take a toll in other ways too. For example, a study in the 1980s &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who experience more daily hassles report greater fatigue, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More recently, researchers have &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00684-004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that increased stress and hassles significantly predicted the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar snack foods, with implications for physical health. And clinical researchers &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1436-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who reported high levels of daily hassles were significantly more likely to develop generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or panic disorder over a follow-up period of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoying experiences are a normal, inevitable part of life. So, whether you’re concerned about their cumulative impact on your wellbeing or just want to reduce the frustration you feel in the moment, there is value in learning to handle annoying things better. This is where evidence-based psychological skills are handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-live-a-values-driven-life-in-the-face-of-dark-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/a&gt; (ACT), there’s an important distinction between &lt;em&gt;unavoidable pain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;avoidable pain&lt;/em&gt;. Micro-stressors such as running late, spilling something on your shirt or receiving a curt text message represent the unavoidable pain that comes with being human. Daily hassles happen. But how you choose to respond to those moments determines whether you add to the stress. Skills grounded in ACT – which I’ll draw from in the rest of this Guide – can help you reduce the avoidable pain that often comes with aversive experiences, including common annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301940?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that ACT can be effective in managing various forms of psychological distress, including those stemming from daily hassles. I’ve seen this happen in my own therapy practice. One client, for example, used to become agitated by his neighbour’s dog barking at random hours of the day and night. Despite his attempt to address the problem by talking to his neighbour, the dog wasn’t going anywhere, and neither was his frustration. Over time and with practice, though, he began to approach the barking with a kind of detachment. The dog didn’t stop barking, but what changed was his ability to pause, notice his frustration, and apply coping skills of the sort I’ll be describing here. That made all the difference. With practice, you too can learn to relate to annoyances in a more skilful way, whatever your next ‘barking dog’ &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Embrace ‘radical acceptance’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to want to fix or undo the annoyances you encounter. But insisting that a frustrating experience shouldn’t have happened doesn’t change that it did happen. What it does do is deepen your stress. It’s like tugging on a locked door: tiring and ineffective. That’s why you need &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-enjoy-your-problems-and-reach-enlightenment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;radical acceptance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life’s little stressors can feel like a series of tiny battles. If you get lost in knee-jerk responses such as wishful thinking (&lt;em&gt;I wish this weren’t happening&lt;/em&gt;), rumination (&lt;em&gt;Why did that happen?&lt;/em&gt;), self-blame (&lt;em&gt;Why am I so careless?&lt;/em&gt;), or blaming others (&lt;em&gt;They ruined my day&lt;/em&gt;), it keeps you stuck in your head, takes you away from the present, and prolongs your unpleasant emotions. Instead of just feeling irritated about a lost key or a rude comment, you end up dealing with extra mental fatigue, shame or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical acceptance means recognising the reality of what has occurred without resisting it. It doesn’t mean you approve of what’s happened. It simply means you’re no longer fighting something that can’t be changed. It is about laying down your weapons and saying to yourself: &lt;em&gt;This is happening. How can I work with it without getting lost in it?&lt;/em&gt; You’re choosing to no longer let it set the tone for &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;your day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few prompts you can use as gentle reminders to practise radical acceptance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how things have unfolded right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t go back and change what’s happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting what happened only fuels my pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I resist the past, I lose the present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now is the only moment I can shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how radical acceptance looks in action: you lose your keys. Instead of spiralling into thoughts like &lt;em&gt;Why does this always happen?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;This is just what I need right now&lt;/em&gt;, you pause and tell yourself something like: &lt;em&gt;This is not ideal. But I don’t want to get stuck on this right now. I’m going to take a breath and calmly retrace my steps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stop resisting reality, you give yourself room to move on with your day, not by denying the frustration, but by refusing to add &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Make room for your emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are like waves that rise, crest and gently fade away, often within minutes, especially when you give them the space to do so. Each emotion naturally urges you to respond. When you act based on these feelings, it’s called emotion-driven behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, small hassles can trigger big emotional reactions, leading you to quickly engage in emotion-driven behaviours. Have you ever watched someone cut in line at a store? Maybe you experienced a sudden rush of irritation and found yourself glaring at the person, mumbling your disapproval, or speaking curtly to a store employee who wasn’t even aware of the cutting. As natural as it is, automatically doing what a momentary emotion pushes you to do can sometimes take you further away from being the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can do instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;emotions live in our bodies first. If you misplace something important, you might feel a knot in your stomach, or your heart racing. When that happens, ask yourself: what am I feeling and sensing right now? Simply noticing your feelings and sensations might seem like a passive response, but it is critical for minimising your entanglement with unpleasant mental content, and it can help you respond to stressors more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;take your noticing one step further. You don’t need a poet’s vocabulary to name your feelings; a short and sweet label works.&lt;em&gt; I’m feeling frustrated.&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;This is anxiety.&lt;/em&gt; You can even imagine that you’re introducing a friend to your feelings: &lt;em&gt;Meet my annoyance. It’s here because the line at the café is moving slower than a sloth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the workability of your response: &lt;/strong&gt;within the ACT model, ‘workable’ actions are the ones that are aligned with your personal values and goals. Basically,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the idea is that every behaviour takes you closer to or further away from the life you want to build for yourself. So, you must ask yourself whether doing what an emotion pushes you to do in the moment would get you closer to that or further from it. You might ask yourself, for example: &lt;em&gt;If I yell at this barista for getting my order wrong, does that help me live the way I want to live?&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;If I fixate on this person’s annoying hiccups, will it serve me &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;later on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workability is less about what works in a conventional or problem-solving sense, and more about what works for you in relation to your values. It is a question of inner alignment and direction. An impulsive response to feeling annoyed – such as cursing at someone, slamming a door, or texting a snarky message – might bring you temporary comfort, but it isn’t workable if it pulls you away from your values. (As I will describe below, you can also use your values, rather than just your momentary emotions, to guide more workable responses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more example to demonstrate all these ways of making room for emotions without letting them dictate your behaviour. Let’s say you’re stuck in traffic, and you feel the frustration building. You can first notice what you are feeling in your body. Then you can name the emotion(s) you are feeling (&lt;em&gt;I’m feeling annoyed, and also powerless&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, you can ask yourself about the workability of what you feel the urge to do: &lt;em&gt;Will honking randomly at other drivers help me be the person I want to be? &lt;/em&gt;You can make space for what you are feeling and still make a choice about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Centre yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even if you have applied the preceding skills, you might find yourself tense, restless or stirred up. Centring practices offer you a simple and powerful way to return to a place of steadiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-second reset is a versatile skill to help you pause and ground yourself. It has multiple variations. I suggest you try out each of the suggestions below, practising one of them for 60 seconds when an annoying experience leaves you agitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feel your feet. &lt;/strong&gt;Bring your attention to the soles of your feet. Imagine roots anchoring you to the earth &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;beneath you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Belly breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Place a hand on your stomach, inhale deeply for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale slowly for a count of 6. Repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ground through touch. &lt;/strong&gt;Press your palms together firmly, or grip the edge of a table or chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sigh it out.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a long, audible exhale, like a balloon slowly deflating. Let your body soften with the breath. Breathe in and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quietly hum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tense and release. &lt;/strong&gt;Clench your fists for 7 seconds, then let go for 14 seconds. Repeat a few times to release pent-up tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these centring activities aren’t just quick, temporary fixes. Each one helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system – the branch responsible for rest, relaxation and restoring calm. With regular practice, these exercises can help you gradually build your capacity to handle daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Commit to acting based on your values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values, in ACT, are &lt;em&gt;freely chosen qualities of being&lt;/em&gt; that reflect how you truly want to live and behave. Your values are your compass. You can think of them as verbs, as ongoing patterns of action. For example, you might recognise ‘being caring’ as one of your most important values. In day-to-day life, you could turn this into specific, values-based actions such as a weekly check-in with your neighbour or a phone call with your friend to see how they are doing. There are concrete steps you can take to put your value into practice; to actively live out your value, rather than just thinking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden [&amp;amp;_a]:no-underline [&amp;amp;_p]:m-0"

matter when you have annoying experiences because they give you a direction to move in. If you’re feeling irritated by an itchy bug bite after a hike that already wasn’t going the way you planned, you might call to mind your core values and remember that being patient with yourself is one of them. If you’re struggling with setting a ‘smart’ thermostat at home, you might remind yourself that you value being curious, and then decide to search for some pointers online (rather than giving up or slamming the wall in frustration). If you’re annoyed that someone isn’t listening to what you’re saying, you might recall that you value being compassionate, and then ask, respectfully, if they can give you their full attention. These would all be examples of ‘workable’ responses that help you be the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think for a moment of Elena. She’s working out of her office at home, midway through an important work assignment, when suddenly, outside her window, a parked delivery truck starts beeping loudly and won’t stop. She notices her heart beating faster and a rush of heat flushing her body. She acknowledges the stress to herself (&lt;em&gt;This is causing me stress right now&lt;/em&gt;). Although she has the urge to pound her fist on the desk and even shout at the delivery driver, she pauses instead and asks whether that would serve her. She realises she’s actually faced a few frustrations today, and she takes a minute to centre herself, using the ‘sigh it out’ exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also asks herself, what really matters right now? And, as she answers that question, Elena taps into her values of being compassionate and being flexible. Knowing the driver is just doing their job and will probably depart soon, she fetches her earbuds to help block out the distracting noise until it passes. She resumes her work, feeling like she’s already started to release the stress she was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the practices I’ve shared, I hope you’ll find that, as disruptive as little annoyances like these can be, they also present everyday opportunities to live in a way that’s more closely aligned with your values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;When are you extra-sensitive to annoyance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hassles can arise at any time, you might find that certain contexts leave you feeling especially vulnerable to irritation. Perhaps it’s during your morning routine, or when there is an unexpected change of plans, or while you are preparing meals. Some physiological states, such as fatigue, overstimulation or a lack of sleep, can also be precipitants of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of your own ‘tender times’ or vulnerability factors can help you anticipate them so that you can respond more gently to annoying things when they pop up. This is why I often invite my therapy clients to get curious about these patterns as they happen. One client, for instance, realised that the middle of the day, when his energy was running low, tended to be his most reactive time. Another client noticed that his tender time was when he arrived home from work, emotionally exhausted after a long day of talking to people in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See if you can recognise the contexts that seem most conducive to frustration for you. This is not about getting rid of frustration or irritability altogether during these times, or trying to control your daily hassles. It’s about entering these situations with an awareness of what makes them challenging – and remembering to practise the skills you’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Meeting annoyance with self-compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less easily rattled by annoyances going forward, &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practising self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; can also help. Self-compassion is treating yourself with kindness in difficult moments, staying present with what you’re feeling, and remembering that struggling is part of being human. It’s like talking to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend who’s having a rough day. People who &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-be-kinder-to-yourself-by-practising-self-compassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practise self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; tend to be more emotionally steady, bounce back faster, and worry less. The psychologist Mark Leary and his team &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-06231-009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that self-compassion acts like a shield, helping people handle little irritations without getting overwhelmed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to practise self-compassion, and you can choose the forms that feel right for you. There are longer, more formal exercises like loving-kindness meditations or journaling, for example. There are also brief and practical ways to bring self-compassion into your day; in my podcast, I &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playing-it-safe/id1513662923?i=1000512408933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refer&lt;/a&gt; to these practices as self-compassion on-the-go. To practise self-compassion anytime, anywhere – including when you’re dealing with everyday hassles – all you need to do is acknowledge how you feel and check what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you’re stuck in a slow-moving line, or you’re cooking dinner and your partner says something that rubs you the wrong way. After you first name what you feel, as I recommended earlier (eg, &lt;em&gt;This is frustrating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;That comment really bugs me&lt;/em&gt;), you then ask yourself: &lt;em&gt;How can I respond to myself with kindness?&lt;/em&gt; You might also ask yourself what you need to hear at that moment, or what a kind friend would say to you. All it takes is a little willingness to be gentle with yourself, even if just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a doer, a striver, or a person who deeply cares about doing things the right way, check out my &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003083153/acceptance-commitment-skills-perfectionism-high-achieving-behaviors-patricia-zurita-ona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Acceptance and Commitment Skills for Perfectionism and High-Achieving Behaviors&lt;/em&gt; (2021). It will help you to compassionately and skilfully manage the frustration that arrives when things don’t go as planned, when people behave in ways they shouldn’t, or when you make mistakes despite your best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who feels things intensely, and who sometimes acts too quickly? For you, annoyances might easily escalate into emotional storms.

But a need to take them on a regular basis to help with falling and staying asleep could be a signal that the body is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;experiencing cardiac issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b15016" class="body-graf"&gt;“Insomnia can increase blood pressure, stress hormones and inflammation,” said Dr. Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, lead author of the new study and an internal medicine resident at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi and colleagues looked at five years of electronic health records from 130,828 adults, average age 56, finding that people who took melatonin regularly for at least a year were nearly twice as likely to develop heart failure compared to those who didn’t use the supplement, though the actual rates were relatively low: 4.6% of people in the melatonin group developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% among those who didn’t take melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0249d" class="body-graf"&gt;They were more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for the condition (19% versus 6.6%), and nearly twice as likely to die during the study period, compared to people who didn’t take melatonin regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7706af" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether the data captured outcomes of all people in the U.S. who take melatonin long term. Researchers identified people as chronic users of melatonin based on medical records only — that is, if they’d been prescribed the supplement. In the U.S., the supplement is available over the counter and isn’t often reflected in medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f47f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“I caution people against drawing concrete conclusions based on this study alone,” said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved with the study. “But now that we have this observation, this is prime time to figure out whether there’s actually a direct association of harm with sleep agents. That would be practice-changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e813e" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi’s research is scheduled to be presented in New Orleans at an upcoming meeting of the American Heart Association. It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60e9c7" class="body-graf"&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body’s organs for them to function properly. Nearly 7 million Americans have the condition, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/heart-failure.html#" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-097025" class="body-graf"&gt;While the study found that long-term melatonin use was an indicator of potential heart problems — and not causing the problems itself — experts agreed more research is needed into the supplements’ possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8b9da" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have patients using all kinds of supplements without understanding the risks,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, a preventive cardiologist and the incoming director of the Davis Women’s Heart Center at Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute in Texas. “If there is harm from a supplement, it means the cost could be far more than simply expensive urine.” Gulati was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35619" class="body-graf"&gt;Melatonin is a hormone made naturally by the body that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Synthetic versions, sold widely over the counter as dietary supplements, are marketed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/falling-asleep-time-may-safest-heart-new-study-shows-rcna4887" target="_blank"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt; or overcome jet lag. Because supplements aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, doses and purity can vary widely among brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-457ac4" class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the supplement has increased in recent years. A 2022 &lt;a href="http://sleepfoundation.org" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 27% of U.S. adults take melatonin, as well as 4% of kids. The new study &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/reports-melatonin-poisoning-kids-increased-rcna31741" target="_blank"&gt;didn’t include children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c323a7" class="body-graf"&gt;People taking melatonin for sleep for more than a year should talk with their doctor, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d3cf" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,” Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, said in a press release. St-Onge was not involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOR2gwbk1kcjhEMjN1aUxwMU93akhsQl9rZWNrQmdfZnRuZ1JrcW1Wc1NuNk90VGVud0w3Mml1Q203X2dvNV9iUk42NHkyX3dSMlhGUThmQ1NuVjBlekNOQWNNOXVYNjFLMXlJVlVtX1ZXR3NKTTh4UlpNcmlMSUp4ekhXa200QXFaTTV3dl9NM19sMEI00gFWQVVfeXFMT3FfNS1VUl81MFl3MnF6WVBPcWJCWTZieG1MQUp1eXZGbldTV0lmencyRktraXJhN1N3YVhaNWM4VGZndlJOa001ZjNGTHhpODFlS0FCVFE</guid></item><item><title>为了优化健康，请将您的习惯与您的生物钟同步。具体操作方法如下： NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5590198/health-habits-circadian-rhythms-body-clock</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Our body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. Every cell that has DNA has a molecular clock, but they don't keep perfect time on their own.

   &lt;p&gt;The return to "standard time" is better for our health according to sleep scientists, but the time change can be disruptive, and our bodies must also adjust to more hours of darkness as we head towards winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. And growing evidence shows that if you align your daily habits with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1261413416/how-to-optimize-your-circadian-rhythm" target="_blank"&gt; your circadian rhythms &lt;/a&gt;— including when you sleep, eat, and exercise — you can help fend off chronic disease and optimize good health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's start with a quick primer: "Your body is filled with clocks, explains &lt;a href="https://inside.salk.edu/fall-2018/emily-manoogian/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Manoogian&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher and chronobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In addition to the master clock in your brain, there are time-keeping mechanisms in every organ and in your cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time," she says. They're all part of your body's circadian system helping you stay in sync with the 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Every day, we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle, and need a reset, explains Salk Institute researcher &lt;a href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/" target="_blank"&gt;Satchin Panda&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The master clock in your brain coordinates all the other clocks through a series of different cues," Manoogian explains, including external cues — such as light, food, and movement. And that's why the timing of our habits can play a pivotal role in keeping our clocks in sync.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Light from the sun serves as the external cue to resynchronize the master clock. That's why it's helpful to open the blinds in the morning and spend time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, it turns out, our first bite of food each day also works as an external cue to sync the clocks in our digestive system and throughout our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Food is also a signal to reset the clocks, especially your gut," Manoogian says. "That's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Eating is a cue to wake up your digestive and metabolic organs, which are primed to function best during the day. By nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you're asleep, your body expects to fast. And so it shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose from the blood and stores it away," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When people eat too close to bedtime or in the middle of the night, their metabolic organs aren't optimized to do their job. The misalignment can lead to poor blood sugar control. Her research shows that restricting the number of hours you eat during a day to about a 10 hour window, can lead to significant improvements in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's lots of evidence that eating out of sync with your circadian rhythms can increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Studies show that shift workers who work rotating, overnight&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4641" target="_blank"&gt; shifts have a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing these conditions due, in part, to the disruption of the natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when it comes to exercise, some people find they do best in the morning, others in the afternoon, says&lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=13785" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Phyliss Zee&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. But the science shows exercising late at night, just before bed can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a peak time for almost every physiological process," Zee says. "The timing of feeding, the time that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help entrain the clocks in your body so that they're in sync," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you eat dinner and go to bed around the same time most nights, your 'creature of habit' ways could pay off. "The science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health," Zee says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And while each person is unique she says,  a general rule of thumb is to begin limiting exposure to light, food and heavy exercise starting a few hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. Manoogian points to advertisements for midnight food menus, and around the clock work and entertainment as examples of our 24/7 modern life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to push back is to track your daily habits. Michelle Pittsley, who lives in Vista, Calif., started using an app called &lt;a href="https://www.mycircadianclock.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;myCircadianClock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to log her eating and blood sugar. She says it helped her stick to a "time-restricted eating" window and helped her track her progress. The app was developed by Salk scientists as a research tool, and is used in Salk Institute studies. It's free to any adult who downloads it. The app provides guidance on when to sleep, eat, and exercise. (Note: if you sign up, you're sharing data with researchers.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When we have "broken" circadian rhythms, the risk for chronic disease rises, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases and common cancers, say Panda and Manoogian. If you want to be more intentional about aligning your habits for better health, here are three strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Drop the late night snack, and limit the hours you eat.&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who restrict their eating to a ten hour window can reduce their risk of Type 2 diabetes, Manoogian says. She and Panda co-authored a study of 108 adults, average age 59, who had symptoms of metabolic disease. They found those who followed time-restricted eating saw a significant &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348690/" target="_blank"&gt;reduction in their hemoglobin A1c&lt;/a&gt; (which is a person's average glucose level over a few months), compared to participants who did not restrict their eating window.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Participants were not asked to reduce calories, only to restrict the eating window for a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was exciting to see that just the time restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%," Manoogian says, because the reduction in blood sugar, if maintained, reduces the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research also suggests that eating your biggest meal of the day in the afternoon, as opposed to later in the evening can be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. A study from Spain found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/30/170591028/to-maximize-weight-loss-eat-early-in-the-day-not-late" target="_blank"&gt;early eaters lost 25 percent more weight&lt;/a&gt; than late eaters. Panda says when his mother gave up a late night snack that included tea with sugar and milk and an occasional snack, that one change led to a significant drop in her blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Go to bed about the same time most nights &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Keeping the same sleep schedule is optimal," Manoogian says. The consistency gives your body a chance to anticipate and keep internal clocks synchronized. During sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/26/g-s1-6177/brain-waste-removal-system-amyloid-alzheimer-toxins" target="_blank"&gt;waste is cleared out of our brains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sleeps-crucial-role-in-preserving-memory/" target="_blank"&gt;memories are consolidated&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a pile of evidence to show rest is critical for our health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But don't beat yourself up when you have a late night out. And of course, there will be disruptions due to travel, work deadlines or weekend celebrations. "Going off your circadian system is not like breaking an arm," Manoogian says. Think of the harms of erratic schedules akin to the way dripping water can erode stone. "Little hits, time after time, can wear down the system," she says. And the result is you can feel slower and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/20/705224709/dont-count-sheep-better-bedtime-rituals" target="_blank"&gt; lots of bedtime rituals&lt;/a&gt; to foster a good night's sleep, including limiting light before bed and sleeping in darkness. Zee's research shows &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/04/01/1089997121/light-disrupts-sleep#:~:text=Unlike%20those%20who%20spent%20both,night%20could%20disturb%20our%20metabolism" target="_blank"&gt;even small amounts of light&lt;/a&gt; while sleeping  can have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Time exercise to your 'sweet spot,' but not too late at night &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl can influence the ideal time for you to exercise, so this will vary from person to person, Zee says. "The better time to exercise depends, in part, on what we call your chronotype," she says, which is a person's innate preference for timing of sleep or when they feel more alert and energetic. One way to estimate your tendency is with a &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents/Morningness-Eveningness%20Questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Morningness-Eveningness&lt;/a&gt; questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're a morning person, then morning exercise can be beneficial," creating a consistent structure, Zee says, but people who grow more alert later in the day, may want to put it off until later. As people juggle competing obligations, exercise may be shoehorned into the time it fits on your calendar, even if it's not your body clock's preferred window. She says it's important to remember that exercise is beneficial, no matter what time you do it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keep this in mind: "Exercise is a stimulatory cue to tell your body you should be awake," Manoogian says, so it's not a surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" target="_blank"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercise just before sleep can &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-bed-linked-disrupted.html#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;disrupt sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In an Instagram video posted on November 4, the nutritionist explains how these ingredients help improve gut motility, promote regular digestion, and naturally ease digestive sluggishness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Natural constipation relief combo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khushi’s go-to remedy for constipation features an all-natural mix of kiwis, chia seeds, and a hint of cinnamon. She highlights, “If you take kiwi, put a spoon of chia seeds on top, a pinch of cinnamon powder and have it daily for three days in a row, then I’m sorry my friend, you will have to say bye bye to your constipation, because this will heal you naturally.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nutritionist explains, “Together this trio hydrates your colon, feeds your gut bacteria, and improves &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/florida-gastroenterologist-reveals-why-your-gut-makes-noises-what-it-means-you-should-have-bowel-sounds-every-few-second-101762076767564.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="bowel "&gt;bowel &lt;/a&gt;regularity in a natural way to reset your digestion without laxatives!” She recommends having it every morning on an empty stomach for three consecutive days.

She explains, “&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/want-to-boost-immunity-try-these-5-kiwi-recipes-smoothie-bowl-slushie-and-more-101756355613665.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kiwi"&gt;Kiwi &lt;/a&gt;is rich in actinidin, a natural enzyme that helps break down protein and improves gut motility. Its insoluble fibre (from the skin) adds bulk to stool, while soluble fibre (from the pulp) softens the stool, making elimination easier and smoother, and hence curing constipation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are excellent for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/physician-explains-link-between-gut-health-immunity-one-antibiotic-course-can-kill-30-to-50-percent-of-good-gut-bacteria-101761376816671.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; as they’re rich in fibres which help improve gut microbiome diversity and promote healthy gut motility. The nutritionist elaborates, “Chia seeds absorb up to 10 times their weight in water, forming a gel-like texture that lubricates the gut and makes stool passage easy. They’re rich in omega-3s and prebiotic fibre which also help in improving good gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cinnamon powder&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khushi, cinnamon is an anti-inflammatory powerhouse that not only boosts digestion but also supports healthy gut motility.

According to Dr Jayesh Sharma, Consultant Surgical Oncologist at ITSA Hospitals in Raipur, paying attention to small but persistent changes in the body can be life-saving. He explains that early detection plays a crucial role in preventing cancer-related deaths, especially in India, where cancers such as oral, cervical, and breast cancer are highly prevalent. Dr Sharma urges people to take routine screenings seriously and not to dismiss recurring symptoms. Detecting cancer in its earliest stages greatly improves treatment outcomes, making awareness and timely medical consultation essential for safeguarding long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29123405" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-cancer-symptoms" source="keywords"&gt;Early cancer symptoms&lt;/keyword&gt; are often silent, warns Raipur oncologist &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma explains that cancer rarely starts with pain or severe symptoms. It usually begins subtly, with small and seemingly harmless signs that gradually progress. Many people ignore these early indicators because they assume they are caused by stress, infection, or normal ageing. However, such delays often allow the disease to advance undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlights that the key to survival lies in recognising these early changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cancers are curable if detected at an early stage,” says Dr Sharma. “Unfortunately, by the time people seek medical help, the disease has already progressed.” This is why awareness and regular check-ups are essential, especially for individuals with a family history of cancer or those exposed to known risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early signs of oral and cervical cancer for timely diagnosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important symptoms to watch for, according to Dr Sharma, is any swelling, sore, or ulcer inside the mouth that does not heal even after several weeks. This is particularly relevant in India, where oral cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease. Tobacco use, both smoked and chewed, remains a major contributor. “If a mouth ulcer or sore persists beyond two weeks, it is not a simple infection. It needs medical attention,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further points to abnormal bleeding as another crucial red flag. Bleeding without an obvious cause, such as coughing up blood, can sometimes indicate lung cancer. Similarly, bleeding between menstrual cycles or after menopause may suggest an underlying issue like cervical cancer. Dr Sharma urges people not to ignore these signs or self-diagnose. Instead, they should seek proper evaluation from a qualified healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common cancers among Indian women&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, Dr Sharma highlights that cervical cancer continues to be the second most common cancer in India, followed closely by breast cancer. He explains that the earliest sign of cervical cancer is often unusual or persistent vaginal bleeding. “Women tend to normalise irregular bleeding, especially around menopause, but this can be dangerous,” he warns. “If the bleeding is inconsistent with your usual cycle or occurs after menopause, it requires immediate investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stresses that the goal is not to create panic but to encourage awareness. “Not every irregular symptom means cancer,” he says. “The important thing is to notice when symptoms persist or recur. If your body repeatedly shows the same problem, it is sending a message that something may be wrong.” Regular screenings such as Pap smears, mammograms, and HPV vaccinations can help detect or even prevent certain cancers before they develop into severe conditions. Dr Sharma recommends that women over 30 should schedule regular check-ups and discuss preventive tests with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising silent cancer symptoms before pain appears&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma emphasises that cancer does not begin with pain. Pain often appears in later stages, when the disease has already advanced. Instead, early symptoms can include persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or changes in the skin and bodily functions. These small but recurring issues should never be brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains that the body often gives subtle clues long before serious symptoms arise. Paying attention to these signs and consulting a doctor early can lead to faster diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. “When something doesn’t feel right for a long time, don’t wait for it to worsen. Seek medical advice immediately,” he urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Importance of regular check-ups and awareness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma’s message serves as a reminder that cancer awareness and preventive healthcare are just as important as treatment itself. Routine medical check-ups, self-examinations, and an understanding of one’s own body can significantly reduce the risk of late-stage cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encourages people to avoid self-medication or ignoring recurring symptoms. Instead, they should schedule regular health screenings, especially if they belong to high-risk groups. “Awareness should lead to action,” he concludes. “When we take the initiative to understand and monitor our health, we can detect cancer at its earliest and most treatable stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: The information in this article is for general awareness and educational purposes only.

According to data from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, around 7 million farmed birds have died from the illness since the start of September. This includes the death of over 1 million turkeys from bird flu, causing supply concerns for the upcoming holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks of bird flu typically flare up in the fall due to the seasonal migration of wild birds. This migration brings different bird populations together, increasing the virus' spread into new areas and into domestic flocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is an outbreak of bird flu this fall important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the most popular bird to cook for Thanksgiving, turkeys are generally in very high demand throughout the month of November. The outbreak of bird flu this fall may increase turkey prices by reducing the supply of available healthy turkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks during the fall migration can lead to the culling of large numbers of birds in an attempt to stop the spread. This can result in a shrinking overall flock size and higher prices due to tighter production and decreased supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the recent government shutdown and revised policies of U.S. government agencies, an accurate representation of this season's bird flu outbreak may be unavailable to many. This could leave experts without the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Because of the government shutdown, I know less than I would normally know," &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/health/h5n1-bird-flu.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&amp;amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about bird flu?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike previous outbreaks, the current bird flu outbreak has persisted for years and has been confirmed in every U.S. state at some point since 2022.

The outbreak of bird flu was identified as the leading cause of a spike in egg prices across the country over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To combat the spread of bird flu, animal science experts at Michigan State University offered several easy-to-follow &lt;a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/fall-brings-bird-flu-risks-what-poultry-owners-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for farmers and breeders.

Difficulty sleeping through the night, restless tossing, and frequent daytime naps are common early warning signs. In later stages, patients often experience "sundowning," a period of increased confusion and agitation that tends to occur later in the day. These patterns hint at a close relationship between Alzheimer's progression and the circadian system -- the internal body clock that regulates sleep, wakefulness, and other daily biological cycles. Until recently, however, scientists did not fully understand how deeply this connection ran.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has now demonstrated, in mouse models, that Alzheimer's disease disrupts circadian rhythms within specific brain cells. This disturbance alters how and when hundreds of genes switch on and off, changing key processes that help the brain function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published October 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that restoring or stabilizing these internal rhythms could open up a new approach to treating Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those," said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte &amp;amp; Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice engineered to model the disease, these genes no longer followed their usual daily patterns. "Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer's genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burden of Sleep Disruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musiek, who co-directs the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and specializes in aging and dementia, noted that disturbed sleep is one of the most frequent problems reported by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. His earlier work showed that sleep changes begin years before memory loss becomes evident. Beyond exhaustion for both patients and caregivers, these disruptions create stress that may accelerate the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle, he said, starts with identifying where it begins. The body's circadian system regulates roughly 20% of all genes in the human genome, orchestrating vital processes such as digestion, immune response, and sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier research, Musiek identified a protein called YKL-40 that naturally fluctuates throughout the day and helps control normal levels of amyloid in the brain. Too much YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer's risk in humans, can trigger the build-up of amyloid -- a sticky protein that forms plaques, one of the hallmarks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amyloid's Effect on the Brain's Timing Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Alzheimer's symptoms follow a repeating daily pattern, the team suspected more circadian-regulated proteins and genes might be involved. In the new study, they examined gene activity in the brains of mice that developed amyloid build-up, as well as in healthy young mice and older mice without plaques. Samples were collected every two hours over a full 24-hour period to track how gene expression changed across the circadian cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that amyloid deposits disrupted the normal rhythm of hundreds of genes in two key types of brain cells -- microglia and astrocytes. Microglia act as the brain's immune cells, clearing away waste and harmful materials, while astrocytes help neurons communicate and maintain healthy function. Many of the affected genes are normally responsible for microglia's ability to remove waste, including amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these genes were not entirely switched off, their usual order and timing became chaotic, weakening the brain's coordinated system for removing toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Rhythms and Potential Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that amyloid plaques appeared to create new rhythmic patterns in genes that do not usually follow a daily cycle. Many of these genes are involved in inflammation or the brain's response to stress and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musiek, these discoveries suggest that therapies aimed at adjusting circadian rhythms in microglia and astrocytes could support healthier brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types," he said. "Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;

If your body isn’t used to using core strength to take the force of a movement, it will usually place that force somewhere else, like your lower back or another joint,” Skinner says, adding this could easily lead to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stronger core also makes daily life easier. “Getting up from a chair, standing up from the floor, picking up your grandchildren—all those depend on the strength and alignment of your body, so the core is really, really important,” says Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Skinner’s three go-to moves to build core strength and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-i2uC9bBAviEptkYabt5J7W" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-i2uC9bBAviEptkYabt5J7W slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-roll-down" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-roll-down"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;On November 2, Dr Brian Hoeflinger – a neurosurgeon with 26 years of experience from Ohio in the US – took to Instagram to explain that high blood pressure is known as the 'silent killer' because it often doesn't show any symptoms, and people can go years without knowing they have the condition until a severe health issue arises.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The dangers of untreated hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video he posted, Dr Hoeflinger talked about how elevated blood pressure damages the blood vessel lining, leading to plaque buildup, known as atherosclerosis, which narrows vessels and reduces blood flow to vital organs. According to Dr Hoeflinger, this can cause fatal&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-shares-top-prevention-tips-for-people-in-20s-30s-40s-to-reduce-risk-of-heart-attacks-heart-disease-101755066069846.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt; heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes, and almost 50 percent of individuals with high blood pressure don't experience symptoms, making regular monitoring crucial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do you know why high blood pressure is known as the silent killer? Because what happens when you have elevated blood pressure? That causes injury to the lining of your blood vessels in your body. And that injury results in a buildup of plaques known as atherosclerosis. And these plaques, as they build up, narrow the blood vessels. And once the blood vessels narrow, you get less blood flow to your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Hoeflinger added: “Particularly if you get less blood flow to the heart or brain, that can result in a heart attack or stroke, which can be fatal. Unfortunately, up to 50 percent of the people that have high blood pressure don't have symptoms from it and don't even know that they have it.

		&lt;p&gt;Cold evenings, busy shelters and anxious owners raise the same question: how do you settle an adult dog with calm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the UK, rescues expect a seasonal rise in adult adoptions as nights draw in. A clear first fortnight reduces stress, prevents bites and cuts the risk of returns. Here is a practical roadmap for people bringing home a grown dog, with costs, timings and simple steps that build trust quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why autumn adoptions demand a plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter days, wet pavements and fireworks can rattle even the steadiest rescue dog. Many arrive with an emotional history and unfamiliar routines. Homes feel noisy. Streets smell different. A plan narrows the world, adds predictability and stops misunderstandings from snowballing into anxiety or reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one is about safety, not affection quotas. Reduce choices, give structure, and let the dog opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set up a safe base within one hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the dog steps inside, prepare a quiet corner away from through-traffic and doorways. Choose a draft-free spot near warmth, but not next to a radiator that could overheat a resting body. Keep it stable for the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Room layout that lowers cortisol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy, non-slip bed or crate with the door open for choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh water within two metres, changed twice daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two tough chews to channel stress into licking and gnawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baby gate to manage access without confrontation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft cloth with familiar scent if provided by the rescue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set feeding and walking at predictable times. Use the same tone of voice and the same short phrases. Predictability reduces uncertainty, which reduces adrenaline spikes and barking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 7-day routine that calms adult dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Day(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Focus&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Practical measure&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1–2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Decompression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short garden breaks, house tour on lead, one room base camp, gentle hand-feeding.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3–4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Safe walks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two 15-minute walks on a Y-harness, quiet streets, allow sniffing, no greetings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5–7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Light training&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Three 3-minute sessions: name response, settle on mat, swap game for toys.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchor mealtimes 10–12 hours apart. Keep play brief and frequent. Sleep drives recovery; an adult rescue may need up to 16 hours of rest spread across the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five mistakes that cost you time, money and trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much freedom, too soon. Roaming leads to toilet slips and guarding. Use doors, pens and routines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing introductions. Crowds, pubs and family parties overwhelm. Start with one person at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipping the early vet check. Hidden pain fuels growls. Budget £120–£180 for a baseline consult and core vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using only a collar. A secure harness plus ID tag reduces escapes and injury; expect £25–£40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correcting fear with scolding. Fear punished becomes fear plus you. Pay calm, reward curiosity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour is often a pain story. Treat discomfort and half the “naughtiness” fades without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health check in 48 hours: what to ask your vet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book an appointment within two days. Bring any rescue paperwork and note changes you observe at home. Ask targeted questions to build a health baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccinations, microchip registration and parasite cover plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral health: gum inflammation and worn teeth affect mood and food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobility: screen for arthritis and cruciate issues; request a pain trial if murky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: set a target range and feeding grams, not “cups”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin and ears: rule out allergies that drive rubbing and snapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise sensitivity ahead of fireworks: consider desensitisation and vet-approved aids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading the small signals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult dogs speak softly before they shout. Ears pinned, head turns, slow blinking and yawning show discomfort. Lip licking outside mealtimes can flag tension. A stiff tail says caution, not confidence. When you notice uneasy signals, reduce demands, add space and switch to calm, low-arousal tasks like scenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, lower the ask, raise the distance, and pay the calm you want to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social introductions without the meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People first, then pets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One visitor at a time, seated, no looming over the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the dog the choice to approach; no touching unless they request it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scatter a handful of treats away from feet to relieve social pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walking beyond the postcode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-clip the lead to harness and collar for backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start at quiet times; add busier places for short intervals mid-walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep ID on at all times; update the microchip record the same day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The calm contact method that builds trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think “I am available, not insistent”. Sit on the floor with a turned shoulder and relaxed hands. Drop snacks next to you without eye contact. If the dog checks in, gently stroke chest or shoulder for two seconds, then stop and let them ask again. Short, predictable kindness beats marathon cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training that lowers stress fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle on a mat: reward any glance or paw on the mat. Build to 60 seconds of relaxed resting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand targeting: dog taps your palm, you pay. Handy for redirection away from triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap cue: present treat, say “swap”, take toy only after the dog releases. Prevents guarding rows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep sessions tiny. Three minutes, three times a day, in the quietest room. Progress comes from repetition, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to do when setbacks appear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many adult dogs follow the 3-3-3 pattern: three days to decompress, three weeks to learn the routine, three months to feel at home. Expect wobbles around week three as confidence grows. Regression is common after busy weekends. Dial back the schedule, rebuild the routine and practise the calm contact method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra help when history is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If behaviour feels sticky, book two sessions with a reward-based trainer accredited by a UK body. Bring video clips from daily life, a sleep log and a list of triggers. One well-timed change—like moving the bed or swapping the route—often releases the knot more than a dozen corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Added gains you can bank this month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgeting protects the bond. Price your first-month essentials: £120–£180 vet baseline, £40 harness and lead, £25 tag and bowls, £30 bedding, £20 chews and food puzzles. Pet insurance reduces shocks; look at excess amounts and dental cover. Keep receipts; charities may offer discounts if you adopted from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For enrichment, think nose, not speed. Scatter feeding in the garden, a rolled towel with kibble for unwrapping, cardboard “parcel” puzzles and short scent trails indoors drain stress without overexciting. Rotate toys every two days so novelty works for you. A calm brain learns. A predictable home heals. And a measured first week pays off for years.&lt;/p&gt;

The surgeon also listed some everyday foods and beverages that may be fuelling the disease. What are they? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Dr Zaghiyan advises avoiding red meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork. “There's about an 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer in people who regularly consume red meat. We don't know of a safe amount, and if you're charring your meat, i.e. cooking it over a flame, that adds even more risk,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second on the surgeon’s list is processed meats such as bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, salami, pepperoni, and deli meats. “Any of these are processed meats, and they increase your risk of colorectal cancer by 15 to 35% if you're eating one serving a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less you eat, the better. There is no defined safe amount,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweetened beverages&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, sugary drinks are not just adding extra calories; they are also a red flag for your overall health. Store-bought juices, carbonated sodas, and fizzy drinks may taste sweet, but they are making your health bitter. “These beverages are artificially sugared with high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and fructose, and consumption of these has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer. A study found that two servings a day of sugared beverages doubled your risk of colorectal cancer versus those individuals who had it less than once a week,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer? Quit, or at least limit, alcohol intake. Dr Zaghiyan emphasises that this includes beer and wine. “This is particularly magnified in individuals who consume alcohol daily. However, there is no safe amount that has been defined. Alcohol not only increases your risk of colorectal cancer, but it also increases your risk of multiple other cancers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods such as chips or ready-to-eat noodles are convenient, but they come at the hidden cost of your health. The colorectal cancer surgeon suggests avoiding anything that comes pre-packaged. “These include chips, packaged cereals, packaged baked goods, and a lot of store-bought breads. All fall into the category of ultra-processed foods,” she explained. The doctor adds that these foods are linked with an increased risk of various gut conditions and colorectal cancer.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-genomes-are-full-of-junk-dna-that-could-be-way-more-important-than-we-realized"&gt;Sections of DNA&lt;/a&gt; once dismissed as dormant and useless could in fact be recruited to fight certain types of drug-resistant blood cancers, new research has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as 'junk' DNA, these bits of DNA don't encode proteins, so were historically dismissed as having no role in biological processes. &lt;span&gt;Scientists have since realized non-coding parts of the genome are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-a-crucial-new-role-for-dna-we-once-considered-junk"&gt;more important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-sea-dragons-fabulous-features-is-in-their-genes"&gt;than we thought&lt;/a&gt;, playing critical roles in gene regulation&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One category of non-coding DNA is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element"&gt;transposable element&lt;/a&gt; (TE): sequences that can cut themselves free from one part of the genome and insert themselves into another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;Mitochondria Dump Their Rubbish DNA, And It Could Be Costing Us Our Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team led by researchers from King's College London (KCL) has now found that stubbornly persistent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hepatitis-treatment-prevents-the-progress-of-a-common-blood-cancer"&gt;blood cancers&lt;/a&gt; can 'wake up' TEs as part of the mechanisms that lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="179304" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells going awry – and that this same activity could potentially be targeted to shut the cancers down.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to validate these findings, which come from experiments with lab-grown cells, but unlocking a new pathway to target blood cancers could lead to treatments for cancers harboring specific mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery offers new hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers, by using existing drugs in a completely new way, turning what was once thought to be useless DNA into a powerful target for treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/research-uncovers-new-treatments-for-hard-to-treat-blood-cancers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biologist Chi Wai Eric So, from KCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research focuses on two blood cancers, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"&gt;myelodysplastic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428"&gt;chronic lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/a&gt;. Mutations typically found in these cancers damage the genes &lt;em&gt;ASXL1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EXH2&lt;/em&gt;, affecting protein production and leading to uncontrolled cell growth. A cascade of instability then follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression.jpg" alt="DNA cancer treatment graphic" class="wp-image-179310 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers blocked the repair system used by cancer cells to fix DNA damage (top row), killing off the cancer. (Zeisig et al., &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes targeting these cancers particularly tricky is that the mutated genes no longer produce proteins that conventional cancer therapies would target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models of cancer and human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found another knock-on effect of &lt;em&gt;ASXL1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EXH2&lt;/em&gt; damage: reactivated junk DNA duplicating and spreading by inserting their sequences throughout the cancer cells' DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unfettered behavior stresses the cancer cells. To resist that stress and continue growing, the cancer becomes reliant on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_(ADP-ribose)_polymerase"&gt;poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase&lt;/a&gt; repair proteins – or PARPs for short. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARP_inhibitor"&gt;Drugs that suppress PARPs&lt;/a&gt; were shown to be effective at killing off the two tested blood cancers. What's more, healthy cells were mostly left alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study sets the stage for a novel and broader approach of creating synthetic lethality for human cancers," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident their findings apply to other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-links-alcohol-to-six-major-cancer-types"&gt;types of cancers&lt;/a&gt; as well, not least because PARP blockers are already used to fight other forms of cancer, although the exact mechanisms involved differ.&lt;br&gt;

Recent studies have found these DNA regions – which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-evidence-suggests-at-least-75-of-the-human-genome-is-actually-junk-dna"&gt;make up a large portion&lt;/a&gt; of the genome – help &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-junk-dna-may-help-prime-our-immune-system-to-fight-viruses-at-least-in-marsupials"&gt;regulate the body's defenses&lt;/a&gt;, aid the brain in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genetic-link-to-fear-disorders-found-hiding-within-what-we-once-dismissed-as-junk-dna-in-mice"&gt;dealing with fear&lt;/a&gt;, and even protect species &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/junk-dna-could-be-why-different-species-can-t-interbreed"&gt;from interbreeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transposable elements that account for almost half of the human genome, but are historically regarded as ancient junk sequences, have been reported in recent years to be reactivated in driving disease development, and multiple cellular processes including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-23-0331"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;, DNA damage, and immune responses," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In total, biopsies from more than 4,000 men will be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool, which analyses digitised biopsy images to produce a personalised risk score, has already &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;been shown in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to identify which men with high-risk prostate cancer would be most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, trials in the US have suggested it could also be used for less aggressive forms of prostate cancer to predict which men are most likely to benefit from having hormone therapy in addition to radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, studies have suggested the tool can help identify which patients can be monitored without the need for immediate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “If and when this gets implemented, you could use one tool irrespective of where you are on the aggressiveness scale, to make a very clinically and life-enhancingly important decision for each of those men.”. He added that the tool was already being widely used in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new study will first use prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, and have suitable follow-up data, to explore whether the predictive prowess of the tool is seen when applied to UK patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool will then be tested at three sites – North Bristol NHS trust, Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde – as men undergo the normal pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Biopsies will be analysed, the treatment choices will be made, and the man will start treatment. But at the same time, the NHS clinicians will be given a readout from this tool and asked: ‘If you had this, would you have recommended the same treatment or not?’” said Hobbs, adding that part of the trial would also explore to what extent the tool affected the time between diagnosis and treatment choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say the hope is that the tool will eventually help reduce under- and over-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A good outcome from this is that this tool is implemented in the NHS,” said Hobbs. However, for that to happen, he said, it had to be shown to be scientifically valid, cost-effective, and making a difference to treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Gerhardt Attard, from University College London, who was involved in the study around abiraterone use but is not part of the trial, said the research was important as approaches often worked well in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When you take that to the real NHS world, there are a number of challenges and differences that would inevitably arise and that’s what this study will address,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ashley Dalton, the minister for public health and prevention, also welcomed the trial. “This groundbreaking research could be a huge step forward, demonstrating the power of technology to potentially transform lives and improve cancer outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is exactly why we’re investing in a digital NHS. By harnessing AI and moving beyond outdated systems, we can transform cancer care – diagnosing earlier, treating more effectively, and improving patient experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNVWY3RlFVcm1ZTXBTSGpCMjlKcnprNnNSMl9xS0ZFblhZaXZuRmRQdnJGUXNXN2FoMHdaTDFSaVF1RUlsRHpOZ2ZoTGM1RVJzdTBHVVZVUF9fUldwQjlfYWt6aUhpaGtDb0hXQXBlVkJ4bkhvODU3MklQM0k2T2ZvNmdTS1NDbkFDOGhxVl84c0xiQ2dpNTN5QzJLUFhHbnRUcWhmTzZpamxkV19rNEZQTEtYSENVSkFmWkdVcUN2UlI</guid></item><item><title>男性需要比女性锻炼更多才能降低心脏病。原因如下。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/men-need-to-exercise-more-than-women-to-lower-heart-disease-heres-why</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Exercise is like medicine for the heart, and just like with medication, you need the right "dose" for it to be effective. But a recent study suggests that the dose might not be the same for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that men need roughly twice as much exercise as women to see the same reduction in their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-disease-329"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-025-00732-z"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; asked over 85,000 UK adults aged 37-73 to wear an accelerometer (a device that measures body movement and activity levels) on their wrist for seven days. They then tracked each participant's health outcomes for just under eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-heartbeat-budget-could-help-keep-track-of-your-health-study-suggests"&gt;A 'Heartbeat Budget' Could Help Keep Track of Your Health, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who did roughly four hours of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week – activities, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or dancing, which raise your breathing and heart rate – had around a 30% lower risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men needed to do roughly nine hours of the same types of physical activity to see a similar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg" alt="man riding a bike" class="wp-image-179856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Men need to do twice as much exercise as women to reduce heart disease risk by the same amount. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI_kBvy3g/"&gt;ArtistGNDphotography/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also true for people already living with heart disease. The paper estimated that women diagnosed with coronary heart disease needed to do around 51 minutes of physical activity each week to reduce their risk of death from any cause by 30% – while men needed to do around 85 minutes of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings might sound shocking to the average person, they confirm something that exercise scientists have suspected for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a clear biological reason that can partly help explain why women and men see such different results from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biological differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women typically have higher oestrogen levels than men. This hormone has important effects on how the body responds to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen can help the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2004-1743"&gt;burn more fat for fuel&lt;/a&gt; during endurance exercise and helps keep the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-017-0152-8"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; healthy – partly by supporting their energy-producing mitochondria (the tiny powerhouses inside cells that generate energy for vital functions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also tend to have more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.24091"&gt;slow-twitch muscle fibres&lt;/a&gt;, which are efficient and fatigue-resistant. These muscles suit the kinds of steady, sustained physical activity most exercise guidelines recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the gap in "minutes needed" for similar heart benefits between women and men isn't as shocking as the findings might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study used &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169649"&gt;device-measured activity&lt;/a&gt;, instead of asking people to recall from memory the amount of activity they did, this means the data on physical activity was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note the study still showed a graded benefit. More total weekly activity was linked to lower risk of coronary heart disease in both women and men. Everyone gains from moving more. The difference is just in how much activity buys the same reduction in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not claim that women should do less exercise – nor that men can't reach similar benefits. It only shows that men may need more weekly activity to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-179859 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Women still need to do the recommended amount of exercise each week to keep their hearts healthy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGxWNwr2I0/"&gt;Artem Varnitsin/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are limits to keep in mind. Activity was measured for only one week – then people were followed for about eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as it's an observational study, other factors that could have partly influenced the results were not taken into account – such as menopausal status (when oestrogen levels drop significantly) or whether a woman was using hormone replacement therapy (which can restore some oestrogen levels). These factors could influence how women's bodies responded to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that the volunteers came from the UK Biobank study. These volunteers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx246"&gt;tend to be healthier&lt;/a&gt; and less deprived than the general population – factors which can affect baseline heart health, access to safe places to exercise and time available for physical activity. This can affect how widely the results apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these results make an important point about current exercise recommendations and whether they need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current exercise guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1451"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the American Heart Association and the NHS are sex-neutral. But this new study challenges these recommendations – showing they might not apply equally to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, most exercise research was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/12908"&gt;done predominantly in men&lt;/a&gt; and results were often assumed to apply equally to women. As better device-based data arrives, we're learning that women and men may get different returns for the same number of active minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because women and men &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.117.004437"&gt;experience heart disease differently&lt;/a&gt; – from symptoms to outcomes. If the amount of exercise needed to reach the same benefit also differs, our advice should reflect that while still keeping things simple and practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't about telling women to exercise less. The 150-minute baseline remains a useful target – &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.12.019"&gt;and many people don't yet meet it&lt;/a&gt;. What these findings suggest is that women who meet current targets may see more heart health benefits per minute of exercise. That's encouraging news for anyone who struggles to find time for longer workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men, the message isn't "double your gym time". It's to keep building activity in ways that fit your week – with more total minutes bringing even greater heart health benefits. Whether different types or intensities of exercise might be more efficient for men remains a question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men and women clearly benefit from regular physical activity. That's not in question. But what does need to be recognised is the clear biological differences that influence the returns men and women see from the same types of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001289"&gt;Cardiac rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; and exercise referral schemes often set identical targets for men and women. This new research suggests we may want to rethink schemes and tailor goals to each person's starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until cardiac rehabilitation becomes more personalised, the core message for now is: move more, sit less. Aim for the baseline 150 minutes of exercise each week if you can. More helps if you're able to.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268624/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

                                                                        &lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;
									    
&lt;p&gt;The human body is packed with natural rhythms, from your sleep-wake cycle to the steady pulsing of blood through the brain to heart rate and pulse.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now, scientists say the gut may hold the key to understanding how this complex coordination happens in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;'s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego have discovered that the gut's rhythmic muscle movements could help explain how blood vessels in the brain expand and contract together. Their findings were published recently in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/8njd-qd14" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When neurons in the brain are stimulated, tiny blood vessels called arterioles expand to deliver more oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vessels pulse and are often in sync with one another. But for years, scientists have puzzled over how this synchronization occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UC San Diego team turned to the digestive system for answers. They found that the intestines, which naturally contract in waves to move food through, rely on a pattern of synchronized oscillations that form a staircase effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same pattern, the researchers say, could also explain how brain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; work together in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Coupled oscillators talk to each other and each section of the intestine is an oscillator that talks to the other sections near it," Massimo Vergassola, professor of physics at UC San Diego, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Normally, coupled oscillators are studied in a homogeneous setting, meaning all the oscillators are at more or less similar frequencies," he continued. "In our case, the oscillators were more varied, just as in the intestine and the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mathematics, the researchers showed how nearby &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oscillators/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oscillators&lt;/a&gt;—whether in the gut or the brain—can lock onto each other's rhythm if their frequencies are similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates step-like transitions, similar to the way food moves smoothly through the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mathematics had been solved in an approximate way before now, but not in a way that gave you these breaks and what happens at the breaks. That's a critical discovery," David Kleinfeld, professor of physics and neurobiology at UC San Diego, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings could eventually help scientists better understand not only brain function but also digestive issues affecting the movement of food, liquids and waste through the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gastrointestinal+tract/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gastrointestinal tract&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The brain is infinitely more complicated than the gut, but this is science at its best," Kleinfeld said. "You ask one question, it leads you somewhere else, you solve that problem, then return to your original question."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A University of Reading study found that eating walnuts with breakfast improved young adults’ reaction times and memory throughout the day compared to those who skipped the nuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walnuts stand out for brain health thanks to their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants, which reduce inflammation and oxidative stress linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts recommend about 1.5 ounces—or seven to 11 whole walnuts—each morning to support focus, memory, and overall cognitive function, ideally as part of a balanced breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Love it or hate it, there’s a reason people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day — it fuels your body with the essential nutrients it needs to prepare for a busy day. Eggs, toast, and oatmeal are all great options, but recent &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/fo/d4fo04832f" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Reading in the United Kingdom found that walnuts might be the breakfast superfood your mind needs to function at its best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study followed 32 young adults (aged 18 to 30) who ate two different breakfasts: one with walnuts and one without. Over the next six hours, researchers administered three cognitive tests to each participant that monitored brain activity. The result? Those who ate walnuts with breakfast had faster reaction times throughout the day and better memory by the end of the testing period than those who did not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, while there was a noticeable boost in cognitive performance, the study only looked at healthy young adults. Therefore, more research with a larger and more diverse sample, including older adults and individuals with health conditions, is needed, says &lt;a href="https://bodytosoulhealth.com/our-founder/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer Bianchini&lt;/a&gt;, RD, a functional dietitian, mind-body wellness expert, and founder of Body to Soul Health. It’s also important to note that the study was funded by the California Walnut Commission. The researchers explicitly state that the funder played no role in the study’s design, execution, or interpretation, but for full transparency, this is worth mentioning.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Among nuts, walnuts stand out as the best choice for supporting brain health and preventing dementia because they are one of the few tree nuts rich in omega-3s (specifically alpha-linolenic acid), polyphenols, and antioxidants. These compounds help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress — a state where free radicals outnumber antioxidants, leading to cell damage — two major factors in cognitive decline, says &lt;a href="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/christina-ni-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Christina Ni&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and interventional psychiatry medical director with Mindpath Health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The nut also contains a wide range of flavonoids (plant pigments), which act as potent plant compounds that reduce brain inflammation, protect against cell damage, and enhance cognitive functions like memory and processing speed, says &lt;a href="https://www.integrative-psych.org/experts/dr-ryan-sultan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ryan Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a double-board-certified psychiatrist and medical director at Integrative Psych of Manhattan. &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000012454" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; support this, finding that a higher intake of flavonoid-rich foods is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and memory problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11595550/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that walnuts can boost blood flow to the brain, support brain cell activity and signaling, and improve neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to repair itself. Ni credits these effects to improved cognitive function and protection against age-related mental decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts also contain the following brain-boosting nutrients, according to Ni. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin&lt;/strong&gt;: A hormone that regulates circadian rhythm and also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02691-6" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;guards against oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and brain cell damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyunsaturated fats and protein&lt;/strong&gt;: Nutrients that provide energy and beneficial fats that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9641984/#sec3" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;contribute to healthy brain cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Essentially, these nutrients and compounds work together to promote healthy brain signaling and function, fuel energy, reduce inflammation, decrease oxidative stress, and increase blood flow, and together, they contribute toward neuroprotection (brain protection) which keeps the brain sharp, resilient, and well-nourished as people age,” Ni says.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-are-the-cognitive-benefits-of-walnuts-greater-when-eaten-in-the-morning"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why are the cognitive benefits of walnuts greater when eaten in the morning? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a fasted morning state, the brain is running on empty, so it mainly depends on its first supply of glucose (a simple sugar that serves as the body’s primary energy source). In this case, Sultan says, “The health benefits appear stronger when walnuts are consumed in the morning because they provide a steady supply of glucose instead of a spike and crash, and these delayed effects overlap with peak work and study hours midday.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, the body is prepared to absorb the most fuel in the morning. “The way the body digests walnuts is the same mechanism no matter the time of day, but the body responds differently depending on circadian rhythm, so in the morning, insulin sensitivity is higher, and the body is primed to use nutrients for energy and brain function,” Bianchini explains. “At night, the body is winding down and more likely to store nutrients rather than actively use them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other nuts also have this “morning effect” when eaten for breakfast because they supply protein, healthy fats, and fiber, which can help you feel full; however, walnuts are exceptionally distinct because they contain higher levels of omega-3s and polyphenols than other nuts, making them a valuable resource for cognitive health, Bianchini says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-many-walnuts-should-you-eat-to-reap-these-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How many walnuts should you eat to reap these benefits? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the University of Reading study, consuming 50 grams (about 1.5 ounces) of walnuts daily improved cognitive performance and brain activity. Generally speaking, this translates to roughly seven to 11 whole walnuts, Ni says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no specific upper limit mentioned in this study, but Ni recommends not exceeding 2 ounces of walnuts per day (about 14 whole walnuts), as excess calories may outweigh the benefits. Walnuts are also high in fiber, so eating too many too quickly can cause digestive discomfort, such as bloating, cramping, or gas. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, those with a nut allergy should avoid walnuts completely, and anyone with pancreatitis or digestive issues may want to limit their intake, since high-fat foods like walnuts can worsen symptoms, Ni says. And although rare, people on blood-thinning medications should also talk to their doctor before eating walnuts regularly, because walnuts can increase the risk of bleeding when consumed in high quantities, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consistency is key for maximum health benefits, so Ni recommends eating walnuts roughly five to seven times a week. It’s also better to choose raw, unsalted walnuts, as the added sodium and sugar in salted or candied options may outweigh the health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t a fan of the taste or texture of raw walnuts, Dr. Ni suggests:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides their potential benefits for brain health, walnuts &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/eating-walnuts-daily-lowered-bad-cholesterol-and-may-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support heart health&lt;/a&gt; by increasing healthy fats called HDL (good) cholesterol, which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol, improves blood vessel function, and decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Given their antioxidant properties, walnuts also help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10215340/#sec8-antioxidants-12-00982" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prevent chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes by neutralizing free radicals and preventing oxidative damage to cells, Ni explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Need more proof to stock up on the tree nut? Bianchini says walnuts have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464624002949#:~:text=As%20primary%20phenolic%20constituents%20that,et%20al.%2C%202021%29." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body, which supports hormones, metabolism, and post-exercise recovery.

"In recent years I went through almost every possible type of treatment, conventional or unconventional, and received medications in insane doses - morphine in quantities of between 5 to 10 mg each time.

However, about two years ago, the pain became unbearable, and he was forced to leave his job and invest most of his efforts in finding a solution.

The article was written by Dr. Ruth Gur, director of the Center for Neurosurgical Pain Treatment at the Pain Institute at Sheba Medical Center and a specialist in neurosurgery and pain medicine. "What was written there ultimately wasn't suitable for me, but it was an initial opening to contact Dr. Gur, who eventually helped us find the solution," Yoav says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="492bm-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="492bm-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="492bm-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Implanting electrodes on nerves to control pain is a known procedure that has been performed for decades on patients suffering from severe chronic pain whom previous treatments failed to help. Dr. Ruth Gur explains that in these cases, spinal pacemakers are used that are implanted inside the body - and their electrodes reach the spinal cord to control the electrical signal in the cord and disperse the pain signals. "The electrodes essentially create an electrical field at certain frequencies that mimics nerve activity and 'dresses' the painful nerves, and we transmit through the electrodes something that masks the natural conduction of pain, meaning we block it," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="2gbt4-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx" id="image_ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1eHDN3SyWx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/02/H100wT641Wg/H100wT641Wg_0_0_2048_1366_0_x-large.jpg" alt='ד"ר אדריאן גרינפלד וד"ר רות גור בעת השתלת קוצב עצבי נגד כאב בבית החולים שיבא' title="Dr. Adrian Greenfeld and Dr. Ruth Gur during a neural pacemaker implantation procedure for pain relief at Sheba Medical Center.

Dr. Gur explains that nerves usually have a long course, for example a leg nerve passes from the spinal cord to the tip of the foot. "Say someone was injured by shrapnel in the ankle, I can implant the pacemaker at knee or thigh level, far from that injury, and it will have an effect. But with Yoav, the anatomical damage and the surgeries he underwent over the years caused distortions along the entire nerve pathways. There's no person like him in the world with such an anatomical structure, and therefore even though the technology exists, we had to reinvent the wheel with the surgery." The one who operated with her is Dr. Adrian Greenfeld, a specialist in anesthesia and pain medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eqag5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Surgery that hasn't been done anywhere in the world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b0jfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Despite the complexity, Dr. Gur didn't give up, and presented Yoav with the option of an exceptional surgery, with an approach to a central nerve junction that passes from the cervical spine near the collarbone area. During the surgery, the electrode is implanted on the nerve itself under live viewing of the electrode advancement by ultrasound according to a pattern designed based on an MRI performed in advance. Dr. Gur notes that the device is wireless, meaning the pacemaker is outside the body - and connected to it is an antenna that sits on the skin and transmits into a receiver located inside the electrode. From there the electrode transmits the electrical signals opposite to the electrical signals of the pain nerves - into the damaged nerve. "This specific surgery hasn't been done anywhere in the world," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="95upb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="95upb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="95upb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Gur explains that the main challenge in the surgery lies in its execution, in advance planning and in the sophistication required, as well as in the need for absolute precision in implanting the pacemaker on a specific nerve, given Yoav's complex anatomical structure. According to her, there was much deliberation before the surgery. "There were too many question marks. And yet, we took a calculated risk because it's definitely still within our capabilities," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d0u4t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yoav says that the doctor who accompanied him in Canada did offer him a surgical option, but according to him what brought him to come specifically to Israel was the high level of medicine in the country, as well as the long waiting times in Canada, which can reach even three years. "The clinic didn't even get around to making initial contact with me, and it was impossible to wait with this," he said. Later it turned out that the surgery offered to him in Canada wasn't at all suitable for his special anatomical case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="6s9tp-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx" id="image_ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rJgq2V2SJbx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/02/Skx111jv4y11x/Skx111jv4y11x_0_150_853_480_0_x-large.jpg" alt='יואב רוקח פן עבר ניתוח השתלת קוצבים עצביים שמסייעים בהפחתת כאב כרוני על ידי ד"ר רות גור במרכז הרפואי שיבא' title="Yoav Rokach Penn and Dr. Ruth Gur at Sheba Medical Center

This proves the excellence and professional level of our unit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="cgv94-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cgv94-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cgv94-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yoav recently underwent the surgery at Sheba, at this stage only in his right hand, and already now he testifies to significant relief in the pain. "Suddenly there's light," he says. "Since the surgery I haven't taken any pain medication. If the pain was around 9 out of 10 before, today it's 1. I didn't believe it would work at this level, and certainly not so quickly, I was very skeptical. During the week or so that have passed since the surgery I kept convincing myself it wasn't working, that it was just post-surgery euphoria. There's also fear of disappointment after so many attempts, but after I was in a follow-up with Dr. Gur, she told me 'it's not placebo or euphoria, it's an implant that's working'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6m24h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Dr. Gur, the success in Yoav's surgery is an opening for patients who until now received a negative answer. "It gives us an understanding that we can use this technology also in exceptional things that aren't by the book," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="d5jlf" data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3oj23-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Pain of nerve origin can occur from a variety of causes - combat injury, car accidents, surgeries, and even nerve pain due to herniated disc or chronic inflammation. Dr. Gur explains that pain medicine, by any means, cannot cure the basic problem that caused the pain. "I can't restore a hand that was amputated or reverse a condition after spinal surgery. The goal of pain medicine is to improve the patient's quality of life as much as possible, but we can never predict with absolute certainty in advance if it will help, and if so, how much it will help. We define success as a reduction of 40%-50% of the pain."Retry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 18:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBSWEh3eGdOVXRmYTVRd05fTUYxTFRYbTctVUlMbjJHWURJU283T2FsWENzTXRmWWM5WG1ocjE4bFB3NTUtUjFsd0ZsZFBpM05KUGZrTHdWWmptd091T2Q2RzZKX3RtVmJm</guid></item></channel></rss>
