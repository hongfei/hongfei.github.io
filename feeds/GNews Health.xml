If, heaven forbid, something happens to their child, these parents should live with the guilt their entire lives because they killed their own child! The blood will be on their hands. There is no doubt about this matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;He also strongly condemned those using religious arguments against vaccinations: “Anyone who claims, in the name of religion or Torah, that it is forbidden to vaccinate, not only misuses the Torah, but is entirely lying! The opposite of the truth. The holy Torah instructs us to follow the guidance of doctors, and if medicine says to vaccinate, then it must be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="intext-2" class="sideInf" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s data-v-4bdf62d7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rabbi Yosef recalled his early support for vaccination campaigns, even personally requesting to be vaccinated in public to set an example for the community. “Blessed be God, today no one disputes that isolation and vaccination guidelines literally saved lives,” he said, also citing historical epidemics such as the one in Turkey, where strict isolation rules were followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="" album="true" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;Rabbi Yosef devoted part of his remarks to warning against “popular rabbis” who prevent people from seeking medical care. He recounted a case decades ago in Beit Shemesh, where a child with leg cancer was denied treatment because a revered rabbi had promised the child would be healed without intervention. Rabbi Yosef said: “I went to Beit Shemesh, shouted at him that he was a murderer spilling blood. Who allowed him to prevent life-saving medical treatment for a Jewish child?! I ordered him to immediately contact the parents and the medical team to take the child to the hospital.” The child received treatment and survived, now grown with a family of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;He also warned against using natural medicine as a replacement for conventional treatment: “It is fine for people to use natural remedies and various alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, but under no circumstances should this replace conventional medicine! Heaven forbid!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;Rabbi Yosef shared a personal tragedy: “I had an acquaintance who passed away because he relied solely on natural medicine. I tried to convince him to go to the hospital, but it was in vain. Eventually, after his condition worsened, I managed to persuade him—but by then it was too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="z396inn" class="" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;

So when my editor challenged me to eat a serving of carrots every day for a week and report back, I was intrigued. The assignment was simple: Eat carrots every day for a week and see what happened to my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, a small, slightly vain part of me was secretly excited. I’ve heard that the beta-carotene in carrots can give your skin a natural, sun-kissed glow, a.k.a. a sort of “fake tan from the inside.” Visions of emerging from my seven-day experiment with a radiant complexion danced in my head. Would I transform into a glowing goddess by the end of the week? I grabbed my first bag of baby carrots and prepared for my transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate carrots every day for a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the big question out of the way first: Did my skin turn orange? Sadly, no. I am not writing this as a subtly-hued Oompa Loompa. My skin tone remained exactly as it was at the start of the week. It turns out that developing &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534878/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carotenemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carotenemia&lt;/a&gt;, or the official term for skin yellowing from beta-carotene, requires consuming a very large quantity of carrots over a much longer period. A single serving a day for seven days clearly wasn’t enough to achieve that coveted (or dreaded) orange tint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I do think my skin looked a little healthier by the end of the week, perhaps simply because my carrot snack was replacing some of my usual, less healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as any dietitian will tell you, carrots are known as a top &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65498961/best-vitamins-food-to-eat-for-eye-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food to eat for eye health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food to eat for eye health&lt;/a&gt;. And, as someone in the thick of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38571118/perimenopause-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:perimenopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; (why did nobody warn me about all the bizarre changes, especially to my eyes—which definitely doesn’t get as much press as hot flashes?), I was curious to see if my vision would sharpen or if my eyes would feel any different. Alas, after a week, no noticeable changes to report. Turns out, one serving of carrots isn’t a magic fix for perimenopausal eye weirdness. Maybe next week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what did happen? Honestly, not much on the outside. But I did feel a few subtle shifts. My digestion felt great, and having a go-to, crunchy snack on hand helped curb cravings for typical crunchy snacks, like pretzels (which aren’t nearly as nutrient-dense as carrots). One of my favorite snacks is carrots with peanut butter, so fitting them into my daily routine was hardly a chore. It was a good reminder of how easy it is to incorporate more vegetables into your day when you’re intentional about it. While there was no dramatic, overnight change, the experiment reinforced the simple, consistent benefits of eating more whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real benefits of eating carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they may not be a magic bullet for a one-week skin transformation, carrots are a nutritional powerhouse. They are packed with vitamins, minerals, and compounds that support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excellent source of Vitamin A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots are most &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:famous for their beta-carotene content;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;famous for their beta-carotene content&lt;/a&gt;, which the body converts into vitamin A. If you’re worried about getting too much vitamin A from carrots, here’s some good news: Your body only converts beta-carotene into vitamin A as needed, so there’s no risk of vitamin A toxicity from eating carrots. This vitamin is crucial for several bodily functions. It supports healthy vision, particularly in low light, which is where the old saying about carrots helping you see in the dark comes from. Vitamin A also plays a vital role in immune function, helping your body fight off infections, and is essential for cell growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Source of antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond beta-carotene, carrots contain other powerful antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin. These compounds help protect your body’s cells from damage caused by free radicals, unstable molecules that can contribute to chronic diseases and aging. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8891800/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; suggest these compounds may help reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration and certain cognitive health concerns. A diet rich in antioxidants is linked to a lower risk of conditions like heart disease and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good for gut health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots are a source of fiber, particularly soluble fiber &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X19322234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the form of pectin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in the form of pectin&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. It helps keep you regular by preventing constipation and feeding the beneficial bacteria in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to everything from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001875/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:better digestion to a supported immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;better digestion to a supported immune system&lt;/a&gt;. My daily carrot snack certainly contributed to my overall digestive wellness throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potassium and fiber found in carrots are a great addition to a heart-healthy diet. Potassium helps balance sodium levels in the body, which may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37772757/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contribute to lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contribute to lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. The soluble fiber also helps reduce cholesterol levels by binding with it in the digestive tract and removing it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should be mindful of carrot intake?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While carrots are incredibly healthy for most people, there are a few situations where you might need to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are a root vegetable, carrots are higher in carbohydrates and natural sugars than leafy greens. For reference, a standard serving of carrots (about 1 cup, or 120 grams) contains &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170393/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:roughly 12 grams of carbohydrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;roughly 12 grams of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;. Individuals with diabetes who are carefully managing their blood sugar levels should be mindful of their portion sizes, just as they would with any other carbohydrate-containing food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with certain allergies, particularly to birch pollen or mugwort, may experience something called oral allergy syndrome. This can cause itching or tingling in the mouth and throat when eating raw carrots, due to cross-reactive proteins. Cooking carrots usually makes them safe to eat for most people with this sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other group, as mentioned, is those at risk of carotenemia, like infants. This condition is harmless and reversible, but it requires consuming very large amounts of beta-carotene-rich foods consistently. So, unless you’re planning on adopting a Bugs Bunny-like diet, it’s not something the average person needs to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My week-long carrot experiment didn’t give me the glow I was secretly hoping for, like I’d just returned from a week in Miami, nor did it result in any groundbreaking physiological changes. Instead, it was a simple, powerful reminder that healthy eating isn’t about quick fixes or dramatic transformations. It’s about consistency. It also reminded me how much I love snacking on carrots and peanut butter. After some experimenting, I also learned that&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fjustin-s-cinnamon-almond-butter-pouch-1-15oz%2F-%2FA-53398170&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fhealthy-eating%2Fa67997995%2Fwhat-happens-when-you-eat-carrots-every-day%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Justin’s Cinnamon Almond Butter;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt; Justin’s Cinnamon Almond Butter&lt;/a&gt; and carrots are a pretty awesome combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a serving of carrots to your day is an easy and delicious way to boost your intake of essential nutrients like vitamin A, fiber, and antioxidants. While you won’t see a miracle overnight, you will be supporting your long-term health in a meaningful way. So, go ahead and crunch on. Your body will thank you for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:40:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFA2cWVMV2ZXWERUczZoNUNud2R4ZVBQMElKQWlYTTRiU2UxeHFlTzFjekZfcGZ5LThvOEU3ejRVWEU1ai1ZTmpIMGVyTVNKQ3QwVUlhRWJEempKcHlyZjFnY1p1OVMwb3pOaXdMaU1TNGVjeWlKMHZfajRB</guid></item><item><title>科学家可能正在寻找大脑错误部位的意识- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/scientists-might-be-looking-for-consciousness-in-the-wrong-part-of-the-brain-2000664973</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What gives rise to human consciousness? Are some parts of the brain more important than others? Scientists began tackling these questions in more depth about 35 years ago. Researchers have made progress, but the mystery of consciousness remains very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;recently published article&lt;/a&gt;, I reviewed over 100 years of neuroscience research to see if some brain regions are more important than others for consciousness. What I found suggests scientists who study consciousness may have been undervaluing the most ancient regions of human brains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consciousness is usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;defined by neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; as the ability to have subjective experience, such as the experience of tasting an apple or of seeing the redness of its skin. The leading &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-consciousness-work-duelling-scientists-tested-two-big-theories-but-found-no-winner-255610"&gt;theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the outer layer of the human brain, called the cortex (in blue in figure 1), is fundamental to consciousness. This is mostly composed of the neocortex, which is newer in our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;

It is thought to be like electricity for a TV, necessary for consciousness, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is another part of the brain that some neuroscientific theories of consciousness state is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44"&gt;irrelevant&lt;/a&gt; for consciousness. This is the cerebellum, which is also older than the neocortex and looks like a little brain tucked in the back of the skull (figure 1, purple). Brain activity and brain networks are disrupted in unconsciousness (like in a coma). &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;These changes&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What brain stimulation reveals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of my analysis, I looked at studies showing what happens to consciousness when brain activity is changed, for example, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632334/"&gt;applying electrical currents&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94051-5#Sec2"&gt;magnetic pulses&lt;/a&gt; to brain regions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These experiments in humans and animals showed that altering activity in any of these three parts of the brain can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;alter consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Changing the activity of the neocortex can change your sense of self, make you hallucinate, or affect your judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Changing the subcortex may have extreme effects. We can &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199905133401905"&gt;induce depression&lt;/a&gt;, wake a monkey from anesthesia, or knock a mouse unconscious. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Even stimulating the cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, long considered irrelevant, can change your conscious sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, this research does not allow us to reach strong conclusions about where consciousness comes from, as stimulating one brain region may affect another region. Like unplugging the TV from the socket, we might be changing the conditions that support consciousness, but not the mechanisms of consciousness itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I looked at some evidence from patients to see if it would help resolve this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Damage from physical trauma or lack of oxygen to the brain can disrupt your experience. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Injury to the neocortex&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://karger.com/ene/article-abstract/84/3/157/125434/Cognitive-and-Behavioral-Disorders-in-Patients?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;make you think&lt;/a&gt; your hand is not yours, fail to notice things on one side of your visual field, or become more impulsive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People born without the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614135/"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5964834"&gt;the front of their cortex&lt;/a&gt;, can still appear conscious and live quite normal lives. However, damaging the cerebellum &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211002061?via%3Dihub"&gt;later in life&lt;/a&gt; can trigger hallucinations or change your emotions completely.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Harm to the most ancient parts of our brain can directly cause unconsciousness (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/126/7/1524/299341?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;although some people recover&lt;/a&gt;) or death. However, like electricity for a TV, the subcortex may be just keeping the newer cortex “online,” which may be giving rise to consciousness. So I wanted to know whether, alternatively, there is evidence that the most ancient regions are sufficient for consciousness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are rare cases of children being born without most or all of their neocortex. According to medical textbooks, these people should be in a permanent vegetative state. However, there &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;are reports&lt;/a&gt; that these people can feel upset, play, recognize people, or show enjoyment of music. This suggests that they are having some sort of conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These reports are striking evidence that suggests maybe the oldest parts of the brain are enough for basic consciousness. Or maybe, when you are born without a cortex, the older parts of the brain adapt to take on some of the roles of the newer parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are some extreme experiments on animals that can help us reach a conclusion. Across mammals—from rats to cats to monkeys—surgically removing the neocortex leaves them &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1999.tb00621.x"&gt;still capable&lt;/a&gt; of an astonishing number of things. They can play, show emotions, groom themselves, parent their young, and even learn. Surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425003343?via%3Dihub"&gt;even adult animals&lt;/a&gt; that underwent this surgery showed similar behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the view that the cortex is necessary for consciousness, as most major theories of consciousness suggest. It seems that the oldest parts of the brain are enough for some basic forms of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The newer parts of the brain—as well as the cerebellum—seem to expand and refine your consciousness. This means we may have to review our theories of consciousness. In turn, this may influence patient care as well as how we think about animal rights. In fact, consciousness might be more common than we realized.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264609/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/peter-coppola-2456261"&gt;Peter Coppola&lt;/a&gt;, Visiting Researcher, Cambridge Neuroscience, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cambridge-1283"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bd9g0002p27ns00az3ms4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease hit, there are almost always warning signs, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn00083b6nuumdqids@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those warning signs are well-known cardiovascular disease risk factors, but more can still be done to reduce cases of heart disease, according to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn00093b6npzcvpd98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For this study, researchers analyzed data from two groups: more than 600,000 cases of cardiovascular disease in South Korea and another 1,000 cases in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000a3b6nwydr8jt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;analyzed what percentage of those cases were preceded by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including blood pressure levels, blood sugar, cholesterol and smoking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000b3b6n18ufwr9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In more than 99% of cases of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or stroke, the patient had at least one of the risk factors before the incident occurred, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000c3b6nqsy05zp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even ‘mild’ elevations of these 4 factors should be addressed with lifestyle treatments or medications,” said Dr. Philip Greenland, one of the study’s lead authors, in an email. He is also a professor of preventive medicine and the Harry W. Dingman Professor of Cardiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000d3b6n7qii8wol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study is particularly important because it reinforces that doctors and patients can manage the risk factors for almost all cases of heart disease, said Dr. Susan Cheng, professor and vice chair of research affairs in the department of cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000e3b6ng3sb61cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some research has suggested that a growing number of cardiovascular disease cases have no traditional indicators of risk beforehand. That could imply that although the health care profession has addressed the factors you can control, other elements researchers don’t yet understand could be a factor, and so they don’t have good prevention strategies to offer, Cheng added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000f3b6nd3dwlus9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What differentiates this research, she said, is that scientists did not rely solely on a diagnosis of diabetes or high blood pressure to determine if the risk factors were present –– they looked at the patients’ medical data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000g3b6nj5y79iik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes, just because someone isn’t labeled as having high blood pressure or high blood sugar doesn’t mean their levels don’t indicate risk factors. And by looking at the broader scope of medical data, these researchers found that almost all the cases did have traditional, modifiable risks in their chart before developing cardiovascular disease, Cheng said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000h3b6n1sudvqz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, if clinicians and patients want to mitigate heart disease risk, the best course of action is likely to continue encouraging management of risk factors like blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000i3b6nt7nuqmjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medical field has learned a lot about heart disease in the past&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;century, and the common knowledge on how to prevent it has been consistent for many years, said Dr. Karen Joynt Maddox, professor of medicine in cardiology at Washington University Medical School&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in St. Louis, Missouri. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000j3b6nzgqu1ok5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But still, implementing those changes continues to prove difficult. Part of the problem is often the abstract nature of heart disease risk, Joynt Maddox said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000k3b6npdhc2yqf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a patient has a disease, it is easier to motivate making changes and implementing treatments to address what they are dealing with, she said. But it is harder to effectively communicate the importance of taking steps to address the very real risks a person faces for a disease down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000l3b6nvx60ro4z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another roadblock is that adding medications or other protocols to address heart disease risk can be associated with the aging process, which can feel scary and unappealing to some patients, said Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000m3b6nda05909q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, he thinks of it as steps toward longevity. Managing blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol doesn’t mean you are losing things &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; it means you are taking steps to preserve your lifespan and health span, creating more years for yourself to feel young and do the things that have meaning for you, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmg1bek48000v3b6nzrr5zarh@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="healthy-lab-results-and-healthy-behaviors" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Healthy lab results and healthy behaviors
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000n3b6nt6ba8ea6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the risk factors for cardiovascular disease have remained consistent, the technology for managing them has evolved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000o3b6nns5iart6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Managing high blood pressure is often a good place to start, and just getting a blood pressure cuff means you can get a sense of your levels at home, Joynt Maddox said. Then, work with your doctor to keep an eye&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on your risk factors and make a plan for management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000p3b6nwrk05iff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the clinical risk factors studied in the research, it is also important to improve your lifestyle risk factors, Tawakol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000q3b6nwgnc9cmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining good sleep, exercise, nutrition, a healthy weight and low levels of stress are key to lowering cardiovascular disease risk, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000r3b6no6vol8hy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, stress and depression turn out to be as potent risk factors as smoking and diabetes,” Tawakol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg1bejhn000s3b6no5jc3bqk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m hoping that the more we double down and show the efficacy of treating all these things together, that more people will combine these approaches and actually enjoy much longer health spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But this doesn't mean you need to go for expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet experts say that despite buzzwords such as 'superfood', placed before some types of fruit and veg, they're all full of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite this, we’re not eating enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures show that just a quarter of men in the UK and around three in 10 women are tucking into five a day – the minimum amount needed to promote good health and ward off illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Rob Hobson, a registered nutritionist and author of Unprocess Your Life, five basic supermarket fruits could offer even greater health benefits than mango – with one costing as little as 40p. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Rob Hobson, a registered nutritionist and author of Unprocessed Your Life, five supermarket fruits could offer even greater health benefits than mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Mr Hobson, the best way to eat apples is whole and unpeeled, because the vast majority of its important fibre and antioxidant content is concentrated in the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;Apples &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ever since falling on Isaac Newton’s head, the apple has proven itself to be small but mighty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that the 40p fruit, which is rich in flavonoids – a plant compound known for its powerful anti-inflammatory properties – helps promote healthy ageing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000784"&gt; study published by scientists &lt;/a&gt;at Queen's University Belfast earlier this year found that participants who increased their intake of flavonoid-rich foods, including apples, by three servings a day, had up to a 15 per cent lower risk of frailty, physical decline and poor mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7795771/Eating-two-apples-daily-eight-weeks-lower-bad-cholesterol-study-finds.html"&gt;recent study by researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Reading monitored 40 people and found that eating two apples per day lowered their levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol by almost four per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Apples are rich in soluble fibre, called pectin, which forms a gel in the gut, Mr Hobson says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This slows down how quickly sugar is released from food into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They also contain plant compounds, polyphenols, that may improve how the body uses insulin, the hormone that keeps blood sugar in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Large population studies show people who eat apples regularly are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Mr Hobson, the best way to eat the fruit is whole and unpeeled, given the vast majority of its fibre and antioxidant content is concentrated in the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating it raw preserves vitamin C, which is partly lost in cooking. Stewed apples still provide fibre but may be better kept unsweetened,' he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoid juices and sweetened apple snacks, which strip out the fibre and concentrate sugar.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pairing apples with protein or fat, for example a nut butter or a slice of cheese, will slow digestion even further, keeping energy levels steady, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Apples are also rich in vitamin C, which helps the body absorb non-haem iron from plant foods, so adding slices to a spinach salad with lentils or chickpeas enhances iron uptake.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Mr Hobson, blueberries are best eaten whole, either fresh or frozen, as freezing doesn’t damage their antioxidants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All berries provide vitamin C, fibre and anthocyanins, the flavonoids responsible for the red and blue colour of berries, that have particularly potent effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies have shown that people who regularly eat blueberries are at a significantly reduced risk of conditions including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deeper the blue hue, the more anthocyanins the blueberry contains, Mr Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are powerful antioxidants that help blood vessels relax and may improve how the body processes glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinical studies in people at risk of diabetes have shown that blueberries can improve insulin sensitivity,' he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In other words, the body doesn’t have to work as hard to keep blood sugar stable. They’re also high in fibre for their size, which helps slow the release of sugar from food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the nutritionist, blueberries are best eaten whole, either fresh or frozen, as freezing doesn’t damage their antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cooking them in muffins or sugary desserts adds refined carbs and lessens the benefit, but stirring them into porridge or sprinkling over salads keeps their nutrient profile intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Combining blueberries with oats or natural yoghurt not only balances sugar with fibre and protein, but also provides calcium and probiotics for gut health,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Blueberries’ vitamin C content also boosts iron absorption, so tossing them into an iron-rich breakfast like fortified cereal or chia pudding makes sense nutritionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A handful with nuts or seeds adds healthy fats, which can aid absorption of fat-soluble plant compounds.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pears are rich in soluble fibre and protective plant compounds, and studies grouping the two together show they’re linked with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;Pears  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pears, meanwhile, work in a very similar way to apples, experts say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re rich in soluble fibre and protective plant compounds, and studies grouping the two together show they’re linked with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Mr Hobson, pears also provide a satisfying sweetness without causing sharp blood sugar swings, and eating them with the skin on maximises fibre and nutrients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat pears raw and unpeeled for the highest fibre content,' he adds.  'A ripe pear provides a good source of hydration as well as natural sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Poaching pears gently in water or red wine can soften them for easier digestion without adding refined sugar which is a useful option for those with sensitive digestion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Serving pears with Greek yoghurt or cottage cheese combines protein, fat and fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, pairing them with nuts like walnuts adds omega-3 fats, which support heart health, Mr Hobson says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like apples, their vitamin C content helps with iron absorption, so including pear slices in a spinach and seed salad is a smart way to boost nutrition.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pomegranate seeds, known as arils, and the fruit's juice contain unique plant compounds called ellagitannins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pomegranate seeds, known as arils, and the fruit's juice contain unique plant compounds called ellagitannins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These interact with starchy foods to reduce the usual post-meal spike in blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Interestingly, trials show that drinking pomegranate juice with bread lowered the blood sugar response, but the same effect wasn’t seen when people were given a supplement pill,' Mr Hobson says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that the whole fruit – with all its natural compounds working together is what really makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fresh seeds are best because they contain both fibre and antioxidants,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pure juice can be used sparingly, but aim for small glasses and ideally alongside meals rather than on its own.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supermarket juices can often contain added sugar, so it is best to check the label.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Mr Hobson, the best way to pair the fruit is by sprinkling pomegranate seeds over lentil or grain salads for a nutrient-dense meal as the vitamin C from the seeds enhances the absorption of iron from pulses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pairing them with healthy fats like olive oil in a salad dressing can also help absorb fat-soluble antioxidants,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even a small portion of the juice with a balanced meal can blunt blood sugar spikes from the starch.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies show that adding raspberries to a carb-heavy meal resulted in lower blood sugar and insulin levels afterwards compared with the same meal without raspberries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;Raspberries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have long agreed that raspberries’ health benefits stem from their terrifically high fibre content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Raspberries are unusual because they’re higher in fibre than other fruits, but low in natural sugar compared,' Mr Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per 100g, raspberries contain around 4g of sugar versus and apple which contains around 11g. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This means the natural sugars they do contain are released slowly,' he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They’re also packed with anthocyanins, like blueberries, which may help the body respond more efficiently to insulin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies also show that adding raspberries to a carb-heavy meal resulted in lower blood sugar and insulin levels afterwards compared with the same meal without raspberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fresh raspberries are great, but frozen are just as good since they retain their nutrients,' Mr Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoid sweetened raspberry sauces or jams, which have much less fibre and much more sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Keeping the fruit whole preserves its natural fibre structure, which is key to slowing glucose release.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raspberries can work brilliantly with oats, chia seeds, or flaxseed, creating a fibre-rich base that prolongs fullness and supports gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They’re also high in vitamin C, so combining them with iron-containing foods such as pumpkin seeds or whole grains can improve iron absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Adding them to yoghurt or kefir offers a probiotic boost alongside fibre which is a win for the gut microbiome,' he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Imagine spending five years hearing everything as if your head was underwater with a pair of headphones on. You can feel the vibrations, but you’re unable to make out anyone’s words clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That was five-year old Eliza Fowler’s reality. Now, with the help of creative technology, she is able to start kindergarten with new ears.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza was born with a rare ear condition called bilateral microtia. Commonly known as "small ear syndrome," microtia is an underdeveloped outer ear and ear canal. Researchers estimate that one in every 3,800 babies in the United States has this birth defect, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/anotia-microtia.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/anotia-microtia.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eliza’s mother, Jennifer Fowler, explained, “She doesn’t have an ear canal, and I always say it looks like a butterfly wing.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There are four classifications of microtia, and conditions range from having a small or underdeveloped ear to having no ear at all. The ear drum and ear canal may be partially formed or completely absent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/m/microtia-ear-reconstruction.html"&gt;Cedars-Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit hospital and research center in Los Angeles, California.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza has grade three microtia - known as severe microtia, where the ear is small and peanut-shaped. Patients often have a partial earlobe, but there is no external ear canal or ear drum. This is the most common form of microtia. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At only nine days old, Eliza had her first surgery. Soon after, the family was introduced to &lt;a href="https://lewinear.com/"&gt;Lewin Ear Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt;, a California practice that specializes in microtia. The family used FaceTime to speak with Dr. Sheryl Lewin, a plastic surgeon who uses the &lt;a href="https://giveanearfoundation.org/microtia-treat/"&gt;Porus Implant Ear Reconstruction (PIER) technique&lt;/a&gt; developed by the surgeon herself. The surgery helps to minimize scarring and create more natural appearing ears.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/kindergartener-hears-first-time-innovative-ear-surgery-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/kindergartener-hears-first-time-innovative-ear-surgery-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Most surgeons will not perform reconstructive surgery until the ear is fully developed, which happens around age five or six. So, for the past five years, Eliza has used a bone-anchored hearing aid, known as a &lt;a href="https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home"&gt;BAHA&lt;/a&gt;, under a headband she wears daily.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In preparation for Eliza's big surgery, mother and daughter made several trips to California to see Lewin.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In June, after surgery to rebuild her ear, Eliza received a cochlear &lt;a href="https://www.chicagoear.com/our-services/hearing-implants/page-10/"&gt;Osia implant.&lt;/a&gt; The implant sits under the skin, directly on her skull. It sends sound vibrations through the bone, bypassing the middle ear, and allows her to hear. The surgery took 10 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The moment Eliza heard her mother’s voice clearly, it brought tears to her eyes, and her family and surgical team sang happy birthday to her new ears. Eliza said sometimes she misses her headband, though.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“She loves her new big ear,” Jennifer Fowler said. “She’ll look at it all the time. She checks on it every day. She’s like oh my gosh, it’s just so beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Eliza said she’s able to hear sounds more clearly, saying “S, ssss, snake.” Her mother said higher frequency sounds are something she is still getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Fowler said one of the most impactful moments after surgery was Eliza taking a bath. She said her daughter started splashing in the tub, and her face lit up.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to her mother, Eliza exclaimed, "Woah, I really like this!"&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"I was like, oh my gosh, you have never heard that because you couldn’t wear your BAHAs in the water,” Jennifer Fowler explained.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, and I can play with my Barbies in the bathtub," Eliza added,  finally being able to hear as her mermaid dolls glided through the water.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza has two dogs, Luna and Lincoln, whose barks she is able to hear more clearly after receiving her implant. She also has a lot of hobbies that she has recently had to put on hold due to her medical traveling and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza loves horseback riding, ice cream and playing on her iPad. Her implant can directly link with her iPad, so she doesn’t have to wear any additional headphones. Her mother said Eliza can’t wait to get back to horseback riding soon.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza has two siblings that traveled with her on some of her surgery stays.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Fowler, who worked night shifts as a remote OBGYN triage nurse until May, said between coordinating her work schedule with her husband’s and family appointments, the travel became difficult. She said she is grateful to be able to take a step back.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eliza’s second and final surgery is scheduled for Oct. 16, when the family plans to stay in California for 11 days. Jennifer Fowler credits finding community and building relationships with navigating her daughter’s diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt; Eliza said she would like to become a doctor who helps kids with broken bones, or a veterinarian, when she is older.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by UCL (University College London) and Imperial College London researchers has shown for the first time how life-saving antibiotics called polymyxins pierce the armor of harmful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/i&gt;, could lead to new treatments for bacterial infections—especially urgent since drug-resistant infections already kill more than a million people a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymyxins were discovered more than 80 years ago and are used as a last-resort treatment for infections caused by "Gram negative" &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. These bacteria have an outer surface layer that acts like &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/armor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and prevents certain antibiotics from penetrating the cell. Polymyxins are known to target this outer layer, but how they disrupt it and then kill bacteria is still not understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the research team revealed in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-resolution+images/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-resolution images&lt;/a&gt; and biochemical experiments how the antibiotic Polymyxin B rapidly caused bumps and bulges to break out on the surface of an E. coli bacterial cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These protrusions, which appeared within minutes, were followed by the bacterium rapidly shedding its outer armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibiotic, the researchers concluded, had triggered the cell to produce and shed its armor. The more the cell tried to make new armor, the more it lost the armor it was making, at such a rate that it left gaps in its defenses, allowing the antibiotic to enter the cell and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the team found that this process—protrusions, fast production and shedding of armor, and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cell+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell death&lt;/a&gt;—only occurred when the cell was active. In dormant (sleeping) bacteria, armor production is switched off, making the antibiotic ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Co-senior author Dr. Andrew Edwards, from Imperial, said, "For decades we've assumed that antibiotics that target bacterial armor were able to kill the microbes in any state, whether they're actively replicating or they were dormant. But this isn't the case. Through capturing these incredible images of single cells, we've been able to show that this class of antibiotics only work with help from the bacterium, and if the cells go into a hibernation-like state, the drugs no longer work—which is very surprising."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming dormant allows bacteria to survive unfavorable conditions such as a lack of food. They can stay dormant for many years and "wake up" when conditions become more favorable. This can allow bacteria to survive against antibiotics, for instance, and reawaken to cause recurrent infections in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-senior author Professor Bart Hoogenboom, based at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at UCL, said, "Polymyxins are an important line of defense against Gram-negative bacteria, which cause many deadly drug-resistant infections. It is important we understand how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next challenge is to use these findings to make the antibiotics more effective. One strategy might be to combine polymyxin treatment—counterintuitively—with treatments that promote armor production and/or wake up 'sleeping' bacteria so these cells can be eliminated too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work also shows we need to take into account what state bacteria are in when we are assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The E. coli cells were imaged at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at UCL. A tiny needle, only a few nanometers wide, was run over the bacterial cell, "feeling" the shape to create an image (a technique called &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/atomic+force+microscopy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;atomic force microscopy&lt;/a&gt;) at much higher resolution than would be possible using light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Carolina Borrelli, a Ph.D. student at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at UCL, said, "It was incredible seeing the effect of the antibiotic at the bacterial surface in real-time. Our images of the bacteria directly show how much polymyxins can compromise the bacterial armor. It is as if the cell is forced to produce 'bricks' for its outer wall at such a rate that this wall becomes disrupted, allowing the antibiotic to infiltrate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team compared how active (growing) and inactive E. coli cells responded to polymyxin B in the lab, finding that the antibiotic efficiently eliminated active cells but did not kill dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also tested the E. coli cells' response with and without access to sugar (a food source that wakes up dormant cells). When sugar was present, the antibiotic killed previously dormant cells, but only after a delay of 15 minutes—the time needed for the bacteria to consume the sugar and resume production of its outer armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conditions where the antibiotic was effective, the researchers detected more armor being released from the bacteria. They also observed the bulges occurring across the surface of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conditions where it was ineffective, the antibiotic bound itself to the outer membrane but caused little damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Ed Douglas, from Imperial, said, "We observed that disruption of the outermost armor of the bacteria only occurred when the bacteria were consuming sugar. Once we knew that, we could quickly figure out what was happening."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Boyan Bonev, of the University of Nottingham, said, "Working together has given us unique insights into bacterial physiology and morphology under stress that have remained hidden for decades. Now we understand better the weak points of bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;

                Researchers say that with ongoing malnutrition crises in many countries, they expect to see more cases of Type 5 diabetes emerging. Pictured here is a patient receiving a blood glucose test for diabetes in a door-to-door screening program in India's Haryana state.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones was flummoxed by 13 patients who showed up at the diabetes clinic he ran near Kingston, Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the time, researchers broadly recognized two kinds of diabetes, known today as Type 1 and Type 2. Hugh-Jones himself coined those terms in a study of hundreds of patients published in 1955.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of his patients fell into those two buckets, but that group of 13 people didn't fit into either category, says &lt;a href="https://uwi.edu/caihr/faculty/pg-boyne.php" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Boyne&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist at the University of the West Indies, where Hugh-Jones did his research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They were relatively young, thin and kind of undernourished looking," says Boyne.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Normally, that would point to Type 1 diabetes, where individuals are unable to make their own insulin and can become underweight. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But these 13 patients never experienced a common symptom of Type 1  — ketoacidosis. That occurs when the body runs out of insulin and starts burning fat for fuel, which can lead the blood to become dangerously acidic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even though they were thin, they never developed keto[acidosis]," says Boyne, seemingly ruling out &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/14/763948647/researchers-try-a-genetic-diabetes-test-to-prevent-emergency-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But they didn't seem to be Type 2 diabetics either, who tend to be overweight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So he said, 'Huh, these guys are different. They don't fit Type 1 or 2,'" says Boyne. "So he called them Type J." That's "J" for Jamaica. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The name didn't stick. Subsequent names didn't stick either, despite cases of this unusual form of diabetes continuing to surface, especially in areas afflicted with malnutrition. Now, 70 years later, an international team of researchers is trying to formalize a new name — Type 5 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The time is ripe" to recognize this disease that could impact as many as 25 million people," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/1982/meredith-hawkins" target="_blank"&gt;Meredith Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, a diabetes researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In April, the International Diabetes Federation adopted the new name. Now, in a perspective published in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lancet Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, Hawkins and an international team of researchers are &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00263-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;urging other entities&lt;/a&gt;, including the World Health Organization, to get on board too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It is important, from a scientific perspective, to give it a name," says &lt;a href="https://www.cmcendovellore.org/nihal-thomas-php/" target="_blank"&gt;Nihal Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, who is part of the effort. "And patients will benefit a lot," he said, since some are getting treatment that can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The dangers of not having a name&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After Hugh-Jones published his 1955 paper, researchers around the globe started noticing similar cases that didn't fit Type 1 or Type 2.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It had a variety of names over time, but they were all generally describing the same thing," says Boyne. "And in Southeast Asia, India and Africa, they really noticed a strong connection with malnutrition in early life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hawkins herself first saw this unusual form of diabetes while working in Uganda in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of very impoverished patients that were coming in from rural areas, very thin and malnourished, very high blood sugars," she says. They'd exhibit classic symptoms of diabetes, including frequent urination, excessive thirst or hunger, and even nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To most clinicians, including Hawkins at the time, such patients seem like classic Type 1 cases. The standard treatment would be to send them home with a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing" target="_blank"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;. But she and her colleagues soon learned that this approach could be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Basically, in many cases, committing them to a death sentence from low blood sugar," if they didn't have enough food to eat at home, she says. Insulin is a hormone that helps shuttle sugar from the blood into cells, where it can be used for energy. Too much insulin, coupled with too little food, can result in dangerously low blood sugar, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seeing such cases of "young people who had died from low blood sugar because they weren't being appropriately treated really motivated our research," says Hawkins.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What makes Type 5 diabetes different&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, she and other researchers have learned that physiologically, people with Type 5 diabetes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35522035/" target="_blank"&gt;look different&lt;/a&gt; from those with Type 1 or 2. Those differences seem to be shaped by malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"These individuals have generally had malnutrition from the time they were in utero," says Hawkins. "They're malnourished as toddlers, as children, as adolescents and as adults. These are the ones that don't catch up. They just stay very thin, and that makes them different than other forms of diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One key difference is the pancreas, where insulin gets produced. Evidence suggests that malnutrition in early development harms the ability of the pancreas to pump out insulin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Their pancreas is crap," says Boyne. "It's not as bad as Type 1, but it's really crappy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That leaves people with Type 5 diabetes in a weird spot. They can produce some insulin and their cells respond to it (unlike people with Type 2 diabetes, whose cells are often resistant to insulin), but they can't make quite enough to normally regulate their blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We felt very strongly that if this was a separate entity, it needed separate treatment," says Hawkins. Figuring out the best treatment will take more research, she says, something she hopes the new name can galvanize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the diabetes research community is convinced that Type 5 diabetes is a distinct entity or that it deserves a new name.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Formal classification risks codifying what may be a spectrum of poorly characterized Type 2 diabetes rather than a discrete entity," says Anoop Misra, an endocrinologist at the Centre of Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolic Research in New Delhi. He says the existing data isn't enough to definitively establish a distinct form of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The International Diabetes Federation disagrees, though, and launched a &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/" target="_blank"&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developing better diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for Type 5 diabetes. (It chose the name Type 5 as uncontested territory, since there are ongoing efforts to label other forms of diabetes as Types 3 and 4.) Advocates hope recognition by other health authorities, including the World Health Organization, could help that effort, at a time when cases are poised to rise in some parts of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Food crises in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/08/22/g-s1-84600/famine-is-declared-in-gaza-what-does-it-take-to-make-this-pronouncement" target="_blank"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/25/nx-s1-5238230/hunger-experts-say-the-severity-of-the-famine-in-sudan-has-worsened" target="_blank"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Yemen could be setting up a generation for increased risk of Type 5 diabetes, says Boyne.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really heart-rending," he says. "This is something that's preventable — it's preventable by food."&lt;/p&gt;

                Light boxes or sunlight simulator lamps need to emit 10,000 lux of light to be effective. If used correctly a light box can help combat the effects of Seasonal Affective Disorder.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Have you noticed you're sleeping a little longer? Maybe you're experiencing a shift in appetite — craving more sweets or pasta. In autumn, our bodies sense the change in light as the dark winter months approach, which can help explain what you are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As daylight diminishes, you may find your mood dimming, too. About 1 in 20 adults have&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/seasonal-affective-disorder" target="_blank"&gt; Seasonal Affective Disorder &lt;/a&gt;— which is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/21/678342879/scientists-find-a-brain-circuit-that-could-explain-seasonal-depression" target="_blank"&gt;seasonal depression&lt;/a&gt;. And millions more experience a milder form of "winter blues."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to fend it off is by using a light box, beginning in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of research has shown that using bright light therapy in the morning can be extremely helpful to reverse some of the symptoms of seasonal depression," says &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=34411" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Dorothy Sit&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist and Associate Professor at Northwestern University, who has studied bright light therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, people sit in front of a light box, which emits bright light, every morning, for about 30 minutes, give or take. Sit says making it part of a morning routine is key. "If people use a light box every day they can experience an enduring effect throughout the fall and winter," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sit points to an often-cited study that found light therapy is &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.5.805" target="_blank"&gt;on par with standard anti-depression medications&lt;/a&gt; in relieving symptoms. Some people do both, taking medication and using a light box, and research shows the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31600678/" target="_blank"&gt;combination can be helpful&lt;/a&gt;. Studies point to improvements in symptoms within one week of starting light therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Understanding our body clocks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Our bodies can be quite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/02/555054483/how-messing-with-our-body-clocks-can-raise-alarms-with-health" target="_blank"&gt;sensitive to changes in daylight &lt;/a&gt;because we rely on it to regulate our &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/30/1211597510/1a-10-30-2024" target="_blank"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt; and our sleep-wake patterns.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And because our internal body clocks don't keep a perfect 24-hour cycle, the master clock in our brains needs a daily reset. "Light through the eyes," is the cue for the reset, explains Michael Terman, a retired professor of clinical psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5178149/light-exposure-circadian-rhythms-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;exposure to morning light &lt;/a&gt;is so important. "What we are doing is resetting that drifting circadian clock to synchronize with the outdoor world," Terman explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Terman is also President of the non-profit organization, &lt;a href="https://cet.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Environmental Therapeutics,&lt;/a&gt; which aims to educate healthcare professionals and the public about therapies to improve mood and health, focusing on non-medication treatments, including light boxes.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Terman says some models of light boxes sold online are either too small or don't emit enough bright light. His organization offers&lt;a href="https://cet.org/how-to-select-a-light-box/" target="_blank"&gt; guidance on how to select a &lt;/a&gt;light box, and recommends purchasing models that meet the standards of devices tested in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few things to keep in mind when starting use of a light box: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag rte2-style-ol"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purchase a light box that emits &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298" target="_blank"&gt;10,000 lux of light&lt;/a&gt;. (Lux is a measure of brightness.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger screens are better, according to the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, because screen size influences light exposure."Smaller sizes increase the likelihood that small head movements reduce the 10,000 lux dose," the group says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjust the angle of the light box. The light box should project downwards towards the eyes at an angle. This will help avoid a glare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with 30 minutes in front of the light box and make adjustments based on how you feel. If you only get a little spurt of additional energy, you may want to increase to 45 minutes. Or if you feel jittery, that may be too much.  "Just as with a drug, light has to be dosed," Terman says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think bright light is still an underrecognized treatment option," says psychiatrist Dorothy Sit. And you don't need to be clinically depressed to benefit. Light therapy can be quite helpful for people who even have "milder forms," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, If you're one of the many people who feels a dip in mood and energy beginning in fall, you may want to consider a light box, Sit says. But she also recommends that you talk to a healthcare provider about symptoms and treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that a lack of light is not the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy, people tend to go out less, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jamie-zeitzer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jamie Zeitzer&lt;/a&gt; of Stanford University. "That can be depressing." He says light therapy won't help with the blues caused by social isolation, so remember to reach out to friends and stay engaged in activities that bring you into contact with others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to feeling good in the coming darker months, we need light, as well as&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt; a handful  of habits&lt;/a&gt; that can help boost our moods, including laughter, friendship, a healthy diet,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/05/nx-s1-5247787/depression-walking-step-count-fitness-tracker#:~:text=%22Studies%20like%20these%20are%20encouraging,some%20cases%2C%20exercise%20worked%20better." target="_blank"&gt; physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and exercise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

fashion editor friend returned from Milan Fashion Week bursting with a story to tell.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Most fashion editors stayed at the same hotel, she explained, and each bedroom had its own mini fridge. After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left "an important package" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic," my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different. "So many fashion people are on it," she tells me today. "And now they're very vocal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Serena Williams, Elon Musk and Whoopi Goldberg have all spoken about using weight-loss injections. Some are now prescribed by the NHS, including Wegovy and Mounjaro, generating scores of headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Really, this should have made it a great leveller.

And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Oviva, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a "postcode lottery".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg3ykg4jrro" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;increase the list price of Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; by as much as 170%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the rises don’t affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's scary," says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s.

They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Plus there are more restrictions too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it. (The BBC has been unable to verify this data.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant that makes Wegovy, told the BBC it is "concerned about the growing disparity" in access to NHS specialist weight management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of deprivation where obesity rates are significantly higher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;NHS England has said the differences could be related to different levels of need and other providers being more active in certain regions, but confirmed it was up to local areas to decide how much to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters Blue Ozempic injection pens lined up" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;While Ozempic is intended for those with type 2 diabetes, Wegovy is prescribed specifically for weight loss&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Mounjaro, NHS England has started it for people with a BMI above 40 who also have certain health conditions. The NHS roll-out officially began in June, but a report published earlier this month suggests that not all general practices had started offering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Just 18 out of 42 NHS boards across England confirmed that they'd begun prescribing it in line with the roll-out plan, according to data obtained by freedom of information requests published in the BMJ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The NHS has previously said it is supporting the phased rollout for eligible patients and that "these represent brand-new services in primary care that are being established and scaled up over time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Mr Fidock believes we are seeing a "postcode lottery".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We have got an obesity epidemic and these drugs provide us with an opportunity to tackle it in a way we have never been able to do before. But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less. For obese women it is worse still, earning 12% and 19% less respectively, based on data concerning 23,000 US workers, published in The Economist in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;NHS GP Matthew Calcasola, who is also involved in a service Get a Drip, which offers weight-loss drugs privately, has his own concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We're concerned health inequality will build," he says. "GPs worry about this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Private patients priced out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meanwhile, a booming private market has emerged. Sara de Souza, a business analyst from Nottingham, is among those delighted that it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Following the birth of her son Vito in 2023, she put on 30kg. "I got to 96kg," she recalls. "Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice.

Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our "broken food system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality," argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London. "In such a system, casualties are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It would be naïve — or even pious — to claim we can simply solve this.

Initially, she chalked it up to a sinus infection. But after a few days of persistent symptoms and negative COVID, flu, and RSV tests, her doctor ordered blood tests. Despite feeling slightly better, Gilbert was advised to go to the emergency room for further evaluation. There, a doctor delivered the shocking news: "I think you have ovarian cancer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole world just stood still," Gilbert told ABC News. "I was just totally shocked. [I had] no family history. I didn't know any of the signs for ovarian cancer.

Her message: early detection is crucial, and women should trust their instincts and advocate for their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ovarian cancer: What every woman must know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ovarian cancer is one of the most serious cancers affecting women in the United States. Often called a “silent killer,” it frequently shows vague symptoms, making early detection difficult. According to the American Cancer Society, thousands of American women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year, and awareness is key to improving survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early signs of ovarian cancer can be subtle and easily mistaken for everyday issues like bloating, pelvic pain, or digestive discomfort. Women may also experience changes in appetite, frequent urination, fatigue, or unexplained weight changes. Because there is no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer, recognizing these warning signs and seeking medical evaluation promptly is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age (most cases occur in women over 50), family history of ovarian or breast cancer, genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, and certain reproductive factors. Women with these risk factors should discuss preventive strategies with their healthcare provider, including genetic counseling and regular checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment for ovarian cancer depends on the stage at diagnosis and can include surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of approaches. Early detection dramatically increases the chances of successful treatment and long-term survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness about ovarian cancer is essential, especially in the US, where delayed diagnosis is common. Women should prioritize routine gynecological exams, listen to their bodies, and never ignore persistent symptoms. Lifestyle factors, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and staying physically active, may also help reduce overall cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By staying informed, recognizing early symptoms, and seeking timely care, women can take proactive steps to protect themselves from ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 06:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxQNnV5Zm9uZ0MtUGtqbUZrcTFEVlp4OElFaUtjdjlLa0lhVGZTbXZDNWE3Z0FNWWEtY0Jyci1SVGRQbjdzN29CQ2J0VE1yZmRvM0tDcU5yZnpBUkhiMlRlVmI1cThma1hJdGdwVWNCZlp4aHNZTXlRSDY5MXpXMlZ0R1FDRnNBS2lsWDJQdU56TWEyS3Y3VkJ0SmtWWTYzNURrWDBqSkE0dXVUS1lBdzQ5S3drTkgwdE02Q091bkJqSElZMDhhTmFQUlpMUUh3Wm45Y1lEUVVTRTJFOEhxS1ZUc3FMYnNJSWstUE15c19BdHZuaGRuWkdGVGxFVXNIejJsMnFUSGRlajhZMVUzaXBj0gGUAkFVX3lxTE1tVkdKdHMzRTdSaC1GbHRhS3V3NVU0LU5scnRSbU1FMGFhOUdZZGc0b1lGMFNEc3pYQmJFR09lTzUtYlhBbGRCbEIzNjA2T0ZfbTZCTlFEaUJJdFh0cnNhTDU2S1IzUndzT1hYSkZDREdBLU1oUHUzRndBQmYtQ21zV0dDU3dlX05PWDNkclctN1c0TmFjcGxBMmE3Nl8xSmZnN1cxUS12WGcxbDBUc2FNaXZ4STIyYTRJQW9XdGFvUkN2QUlhLWJrLUdHd1NXVDlVRVhWNFdBWVFHRWJIZXZGeG5laXRXeGxYQjlIV3pYYzNEZXRxeXdqdUMyRHdGcWhOcjl3R3g5YTVGb00xYlYwNDB1aA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，微塑料可能会削弱您的骨骼- WIRED</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/microplastics-could-be-weakening-your-bones-research-suggests-osteoporosis/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Microplastics could be&lt;/span&gt; a factor in driving up cases of osteoporosis worldwide, according to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00198-025-07580-4" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00198-025-07580-4"}' href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00198-025-07580-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently published research&lt;/a&gt;. The study reveals that when these tiny plastic particles enter the body, they disrupt the functioning of bone marrow stem cells, which are essential for maintaining and repairing bone tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Throughout your life, your bones are replenished. Osteoporosis is a condition where this process goes wrong, with the breakdown of bone outstripping the rate at which it is replaced. This leads to bones weakening over time and becoming more likely to fracture. The condition &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;has many risk factors&lt;/a&gt;—age, sex, medications, diet, smoking and drinking, and genetics are all known to influence it—with the disease developing slowly over time. Often people don’t realize they have the condition until they break a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This new analysis, published in the journal Osteoporosis International, adds exposure to microplastics as a potential new risk factor. The research reviewed 62 scientific articles that had run various laboratory and animal tests on the possible effects of micro- and nanoplastics on bone. Analysis of lab experiments showed that microplastics stimulate the formation of osteoclasts, cells created by stem cells in the bone marrow that degrade bone tissue to promote resorption, the process in which the body breaks down and eliminates old or damaged bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study also found that, in relation to bones, plastic particles can reduce the viability of cells, induce premature cellular aging, modify gene expression, and trigger inflammatory responses. The combination of these effects generates an imbalance in which osteoclasts destroy more bone tissue than is regenerated, causing an accelerated weakening of bone structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When then looking at animal studies, the researchers found that the accumulation of microplastics in the body decreases the white blood cell count—which is suggestive of alterations in bone marrow function. In addition, these animal studies suggested that the impact of microplastics on osteoclasts may be associated with deterioration of bone microstructure and the formation of irregular structures of cells, increasing the risk of bone fragility, deformities, and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“In this study, the adverse effects observed culminated, worryingly, in the interruption of the animals’ skeletal growth,” said coauthor Rodrigo Bueno de Oliveira in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098938"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “The potential impact of microplastics on bones is the subject of scientific studies and isn’t negligible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Oliveira, who is the coordinator of the Laboratory for Evaluation of Mineral and Bone Disorders in Nephrology at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, is now working with his team to further prove in practice the relationship between exposure to microplastics and bone deterioration. This research will begin by evaluating the effects of microplastic particles on rodents’ femurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Although osteometabolic diseases are relatively well understood, there’s a gap in our knowledge regarding the influence of microplastics on the development of these diseases. Therefore, one of our goals is to generate evidence suggesting that microplastics could be a potential controllable environmental cause to explain, for example, the increase in the projected number of bone fractures,” Oliveira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Microplastics and nanoplastics are small fragments of plastic—some so small that they’re invisible to the naked eye—that become detached from everyday objects when sunlight, wind, rain, seawater, or abrasion degrade them. The main difference between the two lies in their size: microplastics measure from 1 micrometer (one-thousandth of a millimeter) to 5 millimeters, while nanoplastics are smaller than 1 micrometer. These particles have been detected &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-microplastic-crisis-is-getting-exponentially-worse/"&gt;all over the world&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microplastics-are-polluting-the-ocean-at-a-shocking-rate/"&gt;natural environments&lt;/a&gt;, as well as throughout the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/"&gt;human body&lt;/a&gt; and in meat, water, and various agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Studies have started to show that this type of plastic contamination can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935124004390"&gt;damage health&lt;/a&gt;. Experts argue that this means the world urgently needs to reduce its use of plastics. Every year more than 500 million tons of the material are produced worldwide, but only 9 percent is recycled, with much of the remainder spreading into the environment and degrading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/la-cantidad-de-fracturas-en-el-mundo-podria-dispararse-a-causa-de-los-microplasticos"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMnctQWNVYWhOYWpmUV9UUzUtUWZ2OFNnWDJQV0dmbkthRFBzOEVlOUFQSWRNWmhWNThiQURyS0pfV0FpdF9rVzhGUTZicEpfU2VLcFlmZ2RQUGN2TmdpdFB4LUF1THJmTTl2WVdxLVN1aTJTa3VmMEgxTlZxT2w3dFJNbV9KWTBUdmFJcFBpdUdaZkQtUTVhM1hXNTJqeHV3NG8wNnZ3</guid></item><item><title>根据医生和护士的说法， 13种严重破坏您健康的“坏”习惯- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-worst-health-mistakes-bad-habits</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I work with patients in end-stage kidney failure. Turmeric supplements &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/turmeric-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;can potentially be very damaging&lt;/a&gt; to the internal structure of your kidneys. While turmeric's anti-inflammatory properties can benefit some, turmeric pills and supplements can potentially act as vasodilators, lowering &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0939475323002727" target="_blank"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have high blood pressure, a vasodilator can restrict blood flow in the delicate internal structure of the kidneys, essentially choking them off. Most over-the-counter turmeric supplements are poorly regulated. If you want to benefit from turmeric, it's best to consume it in a pure form, rather than the mystery amalgamation you get from supplements."&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that puffing on e-cigarettes may put you at increased risk for prediabetes. And people who smoke traditional cigarettes as well as the electronic kind may be adding to that risk by engaging in dual use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is a condition where the level of sugar in your blood is higher than average, and it tends to occur before people develop type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174398" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. While prediabetes is reversible, it does mean that some &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/prediabetes"&gt;heart, kidney, and nerve damage&lt;/a&gt; could already be underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well-established that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-7-common-daily-habits-could-be-damaging-your-kidneys"&gt;smokers are at higher risk for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, but the effects of e-cigarettes (aka nicotine vapes) on blood sugar remain hazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the hope of gaining some clarity, health economist Sulakshan Neupane from the University of Georgia led a team that analyzed more than 1.2 million data points, collected over the phone during a United States &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/about/brfss_faq.htm"&gt;CDC survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With this data, Neupane and team explored the associations between prediabetes or diabetes and the use of e-cigarettes, either on their own or along with combustible cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-vaping-to-a-much-higher-risk-of-heart-failure"&gt;Massive Study Links Vaping to a Much Higher Risk of Heart Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People whose sole nicotine intake was from e-cigarettes were 7 percent more likely to have prediabetes than nonsmokers. That equates to 7,000 extra cases of prediabetes per million e-cigarette users in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, people who exclusively smoked traditional nicotine products, like cigarettes and cigars, were 15 percent more likely to have prediabetes than nonsmokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those who vaped and smoked were at the highest risk for prediabetes: 28 percent more than nonsmokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"E-cigarette use alone elevates the likelihood of prediabetes, with dual use conferring an additional risk. This study highlights potential compounding harm from using both product types," Neupane &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/smoking-increases-diabetes-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that those 'dual users' were at increased risk for full-blown diabetes: 9 percent above nonsmokers. This was greater than the risk for people who only smoke traditional cigarettes, whose risk was increased 7 percent above nonsmokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In an era when e-cigarettes are marketed as a 'safer' alternative to smoking, this suggests they may carry a hidden peril and may be quietly contributing to long-term health problems like prediabetes and diabetes," Neupane &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/smoking-increases-diabetes-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that e-cigarette users who were overweight or obese were at higher risk for prediabetes than users in a lower weight range. Hispanic, Black, and Asian people also experienced greater risk than White people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174411" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174411" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3.jpg" alt="graphs show odds ratio for diabetes and prediabetes, comparing sex (male/female), education level, income, weight, hispanic or white, and physical exercise" class="wp-image-174411 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3.jpg 1000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3-642x722.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3-369x415.jpg 369w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3-768x863.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/gr1_lrg-3-600x674.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174411" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A number of social factors altered the risk for prediabetes and diabetes among e-cigarette smokers. (Neupane et al., &lt;em&gt;AJPM Focus&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several limitations to this study. For one, it's observational, so there's no way of knowing if vaping is the cause of prediabetes. It may be that some other factor puts people at higher risk for prediabetes, possibly by increasing their likelihood of taking up vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"People who aren't earning enough money experience mental stress and tend to smoke or use alcohol to reduce that stress, which leads to these increased risk factors," Neupane &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/smoking-increases-diabetes-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported health data isn't necessarily accurate, and the information used here was collected over a short period of time, so it can't provide any insights into change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, these results emerge from a large cohort. Until people have been vaping for long enough to develop clear long-term side-effects, correlations and animal studies are the best we've got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As the use of e-cigarettes rises rapidly, it's vital we understand their broader health impacts," Neupane &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/smoking-increases-diabetes-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This is not just about the lungs anymore but the entire body and metabolic health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.focus.2024.100281"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AJPM Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's something rather special about the Mediterranean diet: already associated with a lower risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-diet-can-lower-genetic-risk-for-alzheimers-scientists-discover"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-linked-to-23-lower-risk-of-death-in-women"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-choices-can-fuel-anxiety-and-depression-heres-how"&gt;poor mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and more besides, a new study links the diet to better gum health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by researchers from King's College London and the University of Catania in Italy, involved 195 participants with an average age of 49, who were given a health check-up and quizzed on their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;dietary habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those participants who stuck more closely to the plant-rich Mediterranean diet were less likely to have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gum-disease-isnt-only-a-problem-for-your-mouth-heres-what-to-know"&gt;gum disease&lt;/a&gt;, the data showed – especially those who didn't eat much red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;This Diet Helps Lower Dementia Risk, And We May Finally Know Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the healthier diet was also associated with fewer inflammatory markers in the blood – biological indicators that the body is under stress or being damaged. It's another health win for eating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;in the Mediterranean style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that a balanced, Mediterranean-type diet could potentially reduce gum disease and systemic inflammation," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mediterranean-diet-could-reduce-gum-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; periodontist Giuseppe Mainas, from King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174437" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MedDiet.jpg" alt="Mediterranean diet" class="wp-image-174437 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MedDiet.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MedDiet-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MedDiet-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eat like the Mediterraneans – your gums might thank you.

That said, the association is strong enough to warrant looking into further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that compounds found in plant-based foods are likely to be working in the body to reduce inflammation, and that red meat works in the opposite direction. While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-the-uk-predicted-to-have-dental-disease-by-2050-study-finds"&gt;severe gum disease&lt;/a&gt; (or periodontitis) is largely driven by plaque build-up, the body's immune response is thought to be a significant factor too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed that there may be a connection between periodontal disease severity, diet, and inflammation," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mediterranean-diet-could-reduce-gum-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mainas. "These aspects should be holistically considered when assessing the treatment for periodontitis in patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research offers an important starting point that can lead to more research to better understand the relationship between food intake and gum disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't suggesting that you can just change your diet around and forget about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-re-probably-brushing-your-teeth-wrong-here-are-4-expert-tips-for-better-dental-health"&gt;brushing your teeth&lt;/a&gt; to ward off &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-the-uk-predicted-to-have-dental-disease-by-2050-study-finds"&gt;gum disease&lt;/a&gt; – but the foods we're eating, and the bacteria they encourage, could be more important than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in all the other benefits of eating the Mediterranean way, particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;protecting brain function&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a long list of reasons to get these kinds of foods onto your plate more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieting changes aren't always easy of course, but they can be a relatively affordable, accessible, and effective way of improving oral health – something that we know is a problem &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health"&gt;for billions worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research shows the potential effect that a nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet could play in improving the nation's gum health," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mediterranean-diet-could-reduce-gum-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; periodontist Luigi Nibali, from King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, more investigation is needed to develop personalized approaches to help people manage their gum health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jper.70016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Periodontology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Lisa Howard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies into regions of the world where people tend to live longer has shown that having a sense of purpose in life may help people live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, new research from the University of California in Davis shows that having a sense of purpose in life may have another benefit as people age: reducing the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481(25)00354-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study, published in&lt;/a&gt; the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, followed over 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people who reported a higher sense of purpose in life were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including mild cognitive impairment and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression, and the APOE4 gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/having-a-sense-of-purpose-may-protect-against-dementia/2025/08" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Aliza Wingo&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were not specifically asked about the activities that gave their life purpose. However, previous studies on aging have found a wide rang of activities give older adults a sense of life purpose (sometimes referred to as “ikigai”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Sense of Purpose Can Include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Relationships: Caring for family, spending time with grandchildren or supporting a spouse or friend.&lt;br&gt;
• Work or volunteering: Continuing professional work, mentoring or contributing to community causes.&lt;br&gt;
• Spirituality or faith: Religious beliefs, spiritual practices or involvement in faith-based communities.&lt;br&gt;
• Personal goals: Pursuing hobbies, learning new skills or setting and achieving personal milestones.&lt;br&gt;
• Helping others: Acts of kindness, philanthropy, caregiving or advocacy work.&lt;br&gt;
Purpose delays onset of cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that people with higher purpose tended to experience cognitive decline later than those with lower purpose. On average, the delay in onset was very modest — about 1.4 months over an eight-year period, after considering the effects of age, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic risk. However, it is meaningful when compared to current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While medications like lecanemab and donanemab can modestly delay symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, they come with risks and costs,” &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/having-a-sense-of-purpose-may-protect-against-dementia/2025/08" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Nicholas C. Howard&lt;/a&gt;, first author and public health researcher at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Purpose in life is free, safe and accessible. It’s something people can build through relationships, goals and meaningful activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study were part of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey funded by the National Institute on Aging. All had normal cognitive health at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a seven-item survey from the Ryff Measures of Psychological Well-being. Participants had six possible responses (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”) for statements such as: “I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself” and “I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their answers were scored and averaged to obtain a well-being number between 1 and 6, with higher values indicating a strong sense of purpose in life. Their cognitive health was also tracked using a telephone-based test every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study and a professor and neurologist at UC Davis Health. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think’ themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,” he said. “It’s never too early — or too late — to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

A US-based pharma giant has granted royalty-free licences to four Indian generic manufacturers to produce lenacapavir, which prevents transmission by almost 100%, at $40 per person per year, roughly 0.1% of the original cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months. The licensed manufacturers by Gilead Sciences include Dr Reddy's, Hetero, Emcureand Mylan. The first two have announced their pricing. The drugs are estimated to roll out in 2027. But, it could be much sooner or delayed, and what happens in India will impact local access as well as 115 low- and middle-income countries as these firms will be key exporters. Twenty-six additional such countries where people participated in crucial clinical trials are excluded from it as per licence terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exports depend on registration and a certificate of pharmaceutical product from Indian FDA. Besides, there could be regulatory demand for local clinical trials despite strong phase-3 trial data from elsewhere. ""In that case, the delays could spill over in 2027,” said Leena Menghaney, a public health lawyer who has worked with advocacy groups such as Mumbai-based Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, one of seven groups pressuring for global access to lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;” said Leena Menghaney, a public health lawyer who has worked with advocacy groups such as Mumbai-based Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, one of seven groups pressuring for global access to lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe funding for HIV research should be prioritized over other health issues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another pathway to faster access. FDA could provide a waiver for local clinical trials on the grounds that HIV is an epidemic. India reports more than 60,000 new HIV infections annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for such a move. "Waivers have been given for HIV and TB drugs. These decisions are based on the results of phase-3 clinical trials in countries with very strong regulatory systems," Menghaney said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the apex committee of the regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation also granted a waiver of local trials for antiviral drugs against Hepatitis C. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if local production moves ahead quickly, access in India will be limited. National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) has so far included only condoms as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in its HIV prevention programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been drugs similar to lenacapavir, although not on a par in terms of protection and cost, that were not included in the national programme. Naco officials had previously defended this position, saying condoms also help prevent the spread of other STDs and STIs, which increased in some countries when PrEP was introduced and condom use declined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr Ishwar Gilada, an HIV specialist, said, "Bringing about behaviour change is difficult, but sex education and awareness are also part of Naco's responsibilities. For the first time in over 40 years, we have a way to control HIV's transmission by almost 100%. This will reduce the number of people requiring lifelong treatment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganesh Acharya, a city-based HIV-TB survivor, said, "Other such drugs so far have been needed to be taken monthly, are costly and offer relatively lower protection. Even condoms carry a risk of tearing. This drug could bring down new HIV numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 23:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQYmFFdi1fOUk3RndaSnhldVZZdHVGWEVHR19EaWNNSU84ZTA3eHhMWk92MUk4YjJSR3BhWVhua0FsOGdzcFRNd2N3aVMwdUJ4QkpBTjBYWGx1R09PMzJpTkVOZzZfR3IyOXdMNC0wUHNoNTExVUM1MXdhaU9JQkhYdGllaDBZeW1zM2FxN0xvYWNmUjdHbE5WWmRwWVhTai01UUtIcXpIaE43NmVzeUU4Mm5NZlhjTDF6bWc</guid></item><item><title>沉思胶原蛋白补充剂？以下是所有好处- VOGUE</title><link>https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-supplements-here-are-all-the-benefits</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, being a beauty editor is a bit like being a doctor. Mention your job, and people start firing questions at you: Should they &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/drinking-collagen" target="_blank"&gt;take collagen&lt;/a&gt;? Which &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-collagen-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;collagen is best&lt;/a&gt;? And are the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-decline-affects-more-than-just-your-skin" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits of collagen&lt;/a&gt; really as good as they sound? This is similar, I imagine, to how a doctor might find themselves being shown any number of lumps, bumps, and rashes while making polite small talk at a dinner party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, people ask other things… perhaps about red light masks, or retinol, but for the most part these days, the questions are all about collagen. And for good reason. Collagen can help with everything from improving skin firmness to strengthening weak nails and supporting good gut health. So, if you, too, and one of the people now wondering… well, should I be taking collagen? We let actual professions answer, below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body,” &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.hannahalderson.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.hannahalderson.com/"}' href="https://www.hannahalderson.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Alderson&lt;/a&gt;, BANT-registered nutritionist, hormone specialist, and author of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Know-About-Hormones-Happiness/dp/0241733928/ref=asc_df_0241733928" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Know-About-Hormones-Happiness/dp/0241733928/ref=asc_df_0241733928"}' href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Know-About-Hormones-Happiness/dp/0241733928/ref=asc_df_0241733928" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0241733928" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything I Know About Hormones: Six Steps to Optimal Health &amp;amp; Happiness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says. “But it’s not a ‘complete’ protein.” This means it doesn’t contain all nine essential amino acids that constitute a protein cell. But still, it’s not without its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How collagen works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collagen acts like scaffolding—giving structure, strength, and elasticity to skin, bones, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissues,” Alderson continues. “Think of it as the glue that holds everything together, from your complexion to your joints.” Nerds will appreciate that the word collagen actually comes from the Greek word for glue, &lt;em&gt;kólla&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there different types of collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are different types of collagen both in the body and in the collagen supplements we consume. In the body, over 28 types of collagen have been identified, though there are five that we tend to concentrate on. These types of collagen appear in skin, nails, hair, bones, muscles, joints, and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when it comes to collagen supplements, there are a few types of collagen, depending on whether you have dietary restrictions. Bovine collagen or marine collagen is widely considered the most effective form for us to consume, but there are &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;plant-based sources&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Bovine collagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bovine collagen is derived from cows and typically contains Type I and Type III collagen,” Alderson tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;. “These types of collagen support skin, muscles, bones, and connective tissue.” Bovine collagen is found in a cow’s connective tissue, bones, and hide, and as with humans, it acts like a structure-supporting glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Marine collagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marine collagen, on the other hand, is sourced from fish and is primarily Type I, making it particularly effective for skin health,” Alderson explains. Marine collagen can tend to be more bioavailable, meaning it’s more straightforward for the body to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Plant-derived collagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't consuming animal products (or perhaps, just not into the idea of animal-sourced collagen), there is a vegan substitute made of amino acids and vitamin C. Typically sourced from mushrooms or algae, there is no actual collagen in the supplement, but instead nutrients necessary to give the body as much help as possible to build collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the benefits of collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whichever type you take, marine or bovine collagen, the list of benefits is long. One thing to note: You should always choose a hydrolyzed version of the supplement, which has been broken down into smaller pieces to increase absorption by the body. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742704/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; the impact of hydrolyzed collagen (vs. non-hydrolyzed) on skin, the improvement of skin wrinkles is dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Skin hydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collagen can help with skin hydration, elasticity, and the appearance of fine lines,” says Alderson. An important thing to note, though, is that collagen can only do so much to mitigate certain lifestyle factors. Things like how much alcohol you drink, whether you smoke, if you wear sun protection, and how hydrated you are can make a marked difference, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Improved bone density&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bones with high density are more resilient to cracks, breakages, and fractures—all important things as you age. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5793325/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; of post-menopausal women found that certain collagen peptides significantly increase bone mineral density. Other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8441532/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that collagen can help increase bone density in people with diagnosed osteoporosis or osteopenia, both bone disorders caused by a loss of density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Stronger nails&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If weak, flaking nails are one of your biggest pet peeves, collagen could help restore them to their former glory. “As the most abundant protein in the body, collagen is essentially the building block that keeps skin firm and elastic and supports healthy hair and nails,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://us.vidaglow.com/products/pro-collagen" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://us.vidaglow.com/products/pro-collagen"}' href="https://us.vidaglow.com/products/pro-collagen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vida Glow&lt;/a&gt; founder Anna Lahey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Gut-lining support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collagen can help support the integrity of the gut lining, though more research [in this area] is needed,” says Alderson. The gut lining is a semipermeable layer that controls what passes through the gut and into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the nutrients from food, electrolytes, and water are things that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; pass through the gut lining and into the bloodstream. Things like bacteria and toxins, though, absolutely should not.

After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left "an important package" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic," my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different.

And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Ovivia, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a "postcode lottery".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg3ykg4jrro" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;increase the list price of Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; by as much as 170%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the deal doesn't affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's scary," says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s. He has been taking Mounjaro for a year and worries he may not be able to afford to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've lost 20kg and want to keep using it, but it's a lot of money.

They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Plus there are more restrictions too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it.

But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less.

"I got to 96kg," she recalls. "Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice.

"Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Not everyone feels the same.

Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our "broken food system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality," argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London. "In such a system, casualties are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It would be naïve — or even pious — to claim we can simply solve this.

Published in The Lancet, it shows deaths due to cancer increased by 21% during this period, despite advances in treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, both incidence and mortality have declined significantly in US and China over the 33-year period. The reason behind this is strong tobacco control, universal vaccination and organised screening in these two countries, Dr Abhishek Shankar, radiation-oncologist at AIIMS Delhi, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India, he added, continues to fare poorly on both counts because of persisting risk factors such as high use of tobacco, obesity and infections, coupled with limited access to early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Early Detection Saves Lives: Watch for These Ovarian Cancer Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Study links 4.3m &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;cancer deaths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; in 2023 to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;modifiable risk factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evidence-based strategies like HPV and Hepatitis-B vaccination, mammography, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, and colonoscopy screening, and timely treatment remain uneven or inadequate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For India to reverse its trajectory, we must urgently strengthen risk prevention strategies, expand evidence-based screening programmes and integrate cancer care into its universal health coverage agenda," Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's lead author Dr Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said, "Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain under-prioritised in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows cancer incidence has declined by 19% and 20% in China and the US, respectively, between 1990 and 2023, while their mortality rates attributable to cancer has also seen a robust decline - 43% decline in mortality due to cancer in China and 33% in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study estimates that 42% (4.3 million) of the estimated 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were attributable to 44 potentially modifiable risk factors - presenting an opportunity for action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Behavioural risk factors contributed to the most cancer deaths across all country income levels in 2023, especially tobacco use which contributed to 21% of cancer deaths globally. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in all country income levels except low-income countries, where the leading risk factor was unsafe sex (linked to 12.5% of all cancer deaths)," the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parliamentary committee report tabled in 2023 suggested raising taxes on tobacco products in India to make them less affordable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Committee recommends the ministry (health) to pursue with the department of revenue to expedite the decision on raising taxes on tobacco products," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also stressed upon the need to link the Population-Based Cancer Registry to Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to get real time data on cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission is a key health initiative by the govt which aims at providing digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cancer cases in India are detected in late stages leading to poor prognosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee suggested that the issue of screening for cancer should be taken up at 'Jan Aandolan Pace', a mass movement to fight against cancer by timely screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A day in a month may be fixed for cancer screening on the lines of reproductive and child health," the parliamentary committee suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 22:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPV2REUVNqUUpQdXRmLVVwN1pSLVk1cV92Qy1VTUJwajdUZVBZcXU5c2VVU1JzUXB2VTQtcEpIalo0aUV4NEtMTFVFWkp6SUxtTE5FbTRrWUF4M2FjZklRRkZER0FDWnFpZk5iZy13c3o3U2V0LWNmbnJDdEZPb2VEODg2d0pGMkhFSk1qMjIxZTYzVzhXckNrenZRX0s2LUhsQk1WbUxYaGp1VW0zeVFvWk5Bd19GWjFjeXBV</guid></item><item><title>如何避免今年冬天生病：提高免疫力的12种方法-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-not-to-get-sick-this-winter-2s93cs7jj</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Are you ready for winter? Braced for a dip in mood and a deluge of leaves on sodden streets that can make leaving the house for work, let alone that morning run, feel daunting? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The health secretary, Wes Streeting, recently said the NHS would hold “war game” exercises to prepare for the surge in seasonal illnesses, in the hope of avoiding yet another year of chaos in which staff at the beleaguered health service cannot cope with demand. “We’re doing everything we can to stop history repeating itself,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While we might be wise not to hold our breath, there is plenty we can do ourselves to strengthen our immunity and protect ourselves from the health challenges winter presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As the weather cools and daylight hours diminish, the lure of the couch grows stronger. But “exercise is definitely helpful to your immune system”, says Daniel Davis, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. Both cardiovascular and weight training increase the number of neutrophils, white blood cells important to help fight infection. These, Davis explains, send out “a web-like structure made of DNA and proteins that can capture bacteria and lead to their destruction”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When we exercise to extremes, however, our sleep and stress levels are also often affected, which “could dampen immunity”, he says. “There’s some evidence, for example, that Olympic athletes might be more susceptible to certain types of respiratory infections after very strenuous exercise.” There’s no “threshold” as to how much activity will help to keep illness at bay, he adds, but balance appears key. The NHS suggests 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/strength-training-midlife-weight-workout-exercises-zd6vmqx09" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to start weight training in midlife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.4"&gt;&lt;div id="ed8f1bb0-886e-4211-88ee-b69ac93ad502"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Confronting the elements boosts physical and mental health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;2. And don’t give up on outdoor exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Braving the elements “can improve mental and physical resilience”, says the personal trainer Kate Rowe-Ham, author of &lt;i&gt;Owning Your Menopause&lt;/i&gt;. “I love a rainy run.” She recommends joining a running club, which is not only safer than running alone but provides accountability, and adds: “Lots of clubs have a lit track to make running after dark easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, trainers with good tread are essential for muddy, wet terrain. Last year a systematic review into falling and older adults found that the winter months led to an increase in the incidence of falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Trainers don’t have to be flashy or expensive but protecting your ankles is key,” says Rowe-Ham, who adds that now is a good time to start practising your balance ahead of January icy snaps. “Balance on one leg for 20 seconds every day. Repeat on the other leg. Adding in ankle circles, slowly rotating your elevated foot, improves mobility, which will help you withstand unstable ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/outdoor-workout-make-you-fitter-exercises-hcd95v0rm" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green exercise: why an outdoor workout will make you fitter and slimmer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;3. Be careful about comfort eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That packet of biscuits won’t eat itself but it doesn’t mean you have to. The desire to comfort ourselves with stodge, and a lower availability of fresh produce in the shops in autumn and winter, means that “we have a less diverse microbiome and that’s thought to make our immune system more vulnerable”, says the nutritionist Dr Megan Rossi, aka the Gut Health Doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Adding excess weight can also weaken the immune system. A study in the journal Frontiers in Endocrinology this year found that overweight and obese people had more than a 10 per cent higher chance of developing chronic infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Rossi suggests increasing your intake of fibre, which triggers the gut to produce the hormone GLP-1 to regulate appetite without weight loss jabs. She also suggests adding variety to your diet by using frozen food, such as berries and spinach, to keep our microbiome healthy or adding a can of legumes like chickpeas or butter beans to a soup for a lunch that “contain prebiotics that feed your gut microbes”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A sensible dinner choice would be oily fish such as mackerel that “supports our immune system”, Rossi says. Meanwhile, adding probiotics-rich kefir yoghurt to breakfasts and desserts will improve gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;4. And go easy on the alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As the evenings draw in, the temptation for “wine o’clock” to start earlier might be strong but alcohol makes the gut lining more permeable, which causes inflammation that weakens the immune system. Rossi advises a maximum of one or two drinks, ideally dark beer or red wine. These contain polyphenols that feed the gut lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.20"&gt;&lt;div id="dca5b02a-91dd-4305-8c4a-b33f7ec09632"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Hygiene is especially crucial in winter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;5. Wash under your nails and disinfect light switches to lower your risk of norovirus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The NHS warned that there were 18 outbreaks of norovirus — the most common form of gastroenteritis — in one month alone last autumn. To minimise your risk of catching it this year, be scrupulous with hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alcohol hand gels don’t work very well against it. Soap and water are much more effective, so aim to wash your hands regularly,” says NHS GP Deepali Misra-Sharp. “Use warm water, and rub all parts of your hands — front, back, between the fingers and under the nails — for at least 20 seconds. Be extra vigilant about keeping kitchen and bathroom surfaces clean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Using a household disinfectant or diluted bleach solution is more effective than general surface sprays, as norovirus is quite resilient. Pay particular attention to frequently touched areas such as taps, door handles and light switches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-get-fit-in-20-minutes-t9bptph8k" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get fit in 20 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;6. Get your flu jab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Spending more time indoors makes it easier for viruses to circulate, while “cold, dry air can make the lining of the nose and throat more vulnerable to infection”, Misra-Sharp explains. She adds that reduced sunlight exposure lowers vitamin D levels, “which can play a role in immune function”. Little wonder cases of flu rocket in winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Older adults, people with chronic health conditions, pregnant women and children can have the flu vaccine free on the NHS, yet government figures suggest the majority don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I strongly recommend vaccines where eligible,” Misra-Sharp says. Those who aren’t eligible can get the jab privately at pharmacies for about £20. “For many the cost is worthwhile, particularly if you live with or care for someone vulnerable, or if time off work would be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On the NHS pregnant women and eligible children can have their vaccinations now; eligible adults can have theirs from October 1. Private vaccinations can also be booked now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Also worth considering is a vaccine for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), a common virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages, which is usually mild but can cause pneumonia. Last September the NHS launched its RSV vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/rsv-vaccine/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;programme&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women and those aged 75 to 79, or who turned 80 after September 1, 2024. In some regions, including Essex and Suffolk, you can get vaccinated at pharmacies as well as your local GP surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/eat-yourself-fit-diet-exercise-health-body-2023-6vcznh9jc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to eat yourself fit — the foods that boost muscles and stamina&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;7. That Covid booster is still important too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lockdowns might feel a lifetime away “but Covid is still circulating and can cause a nasty illness even if you’re generally healthy”, Misra-Sharp says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;You’re eligible for a booster on the NHS if you’re over 75, a resident in a care home for older adults or have a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Evidence suggests exercising before a vaccination may make it more efficient. “Antibody levels are affected by exercise beforehand,” says Davis, who is the author of &lt;i&gt;Self Defence: A Myth-busting Guide to Immune Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In 2023 a systematic review in SAGE Open Medicine found higher levels of cells that produce antibodies were observed in patients who had a vaccination &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;exercised, rather than simply had a vaccination, and that consistent “moderate-intensity physical activity”, whether directly before a jab or not, potentially improved the vaccination response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Try and have a good night’s sleep before you have a vaccine,” Davis adds. A 2023 meta-analysis in the journal Current Biology showed that a lack of sleep “substantially decreases the response to antiviral vaccination”, and that being well rested both before and after a jab can “enhance and prolong” the response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/what-the-top-health-experts-do-each-day-and-you-should-too-nf92jtrxr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the top health experts do each day (and you should too)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;8. Don’t obsess about vitamin C — but do take vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There’s no persuasive evidence that taking a vitamin C supplement will prevent you getting a cold, and while a 2016 review in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine revealed that adults taking 1-2mg of vitamin C daily recovered from a cold 8 per cent quicker, this recovery might have been due to other measures: more rest and sleep, for example, according to Davis, who emphasises that there is, however, “good evidence” that vitamins D and A support immune health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eggs and oily fish are good sources of vitamin D; orange vegetables such as carrots and leafy vegetables like spinach are rich in vitamin A. One recent Slovenian study found 63 per cent of participants were vitamin D deficient in winter compared with 6 per cent in summer, so consider a supplement — a major analysis in the BMJ discovered that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;9. Brighten up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Colder weather and fewer daylight hours “have a significant impact on how we think, feel and behave”, says Suzy Reading, chartered psychologist and author of &lt;i&gt;Self-Care for Winter: Seven Steps to Thriving in the Colder Months&lt;/i&gt;. A dip in mood can increase the likelihood of illness — research in the journal Frontiers in Psychology found that stress and depression impair the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Reading suggests deploying our senses for cheer. For example, wear a bright red coat that lifts your spirit, fill your house with lamps and candles, and make sure you have clean windows to maximise natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;10. The two bacterial strains that limit cold and flu symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Seventy per cent of our immune system lives in the gut, Rossi says. Two bacterial strains beneficial for limiting cold and flu occurrence and reducing symptoms are LGG (&lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;GG&lt;/i&gt;) and BB-12 (&lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium animalis subsp Lactis&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study in the British Journal of Nutrition revealed that college students who received a combination of both for 12 weeks experienced a 33 per cent reduction in the number of days with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms compared with those who received a placebo. Neither bacteria is commonly in food. Rossi’s company, Smart Strains, sells a supplement with both, as do Optibac (available from Boots) and Bio-Kult (from Holland &amp;amp; Barrett).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;11. Keep in touch with yourself (and others)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Reading says that a somatic hold — a gentle, self-applied touch — will release tension and stress. To do it, she says, “Rub your hands together to create heat, then cradle your face in your hands.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Maintaining your social life may require more effort during darker evenings but it is important — studies have linked social isolation to an altered immune response. “Can you meet friends for brunch? Stay connected via voice notes?” Reading asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-26-best-ways-to-keep-fit-over-40-lf7hhrg7h" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 26 best ways to keep fit over 40&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;12. Switch to a ‘winter’ duvet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During sleep, levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which dampens the immune system, are low, allowing it time to repair. Studies have shown that people with disrupted sleep, such as night shift workers, are more susceptible to infections. And in winter we have “a biological need” to kip more, says the sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley — until the introduction of the lightbulb, we had little choice but to. So if you’re tired at 9pm, go to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A cool room is important for a good night’s sleep because your body temperature has to drop by about 1C to trigger drowsiness. Stanley recommends 16-18C. A cool bed, however, is not necessary — the body loses enough heat through the head and face, so “having a thicker, 15-tog duvet in the winter is perfectly sensible”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Professor Daniel Davis and Dr Megan Rossi will be speaking at &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://live.newscientist.com/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Scientist Live at Excel &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;London in October&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNTlJGZmN6cmoycDFDV1NwU3VwT25hSWYwYk5jNkhoM2pOSWNzWUZBN3Q0al9MTm1BY1NidzNCeUY0RHNvNWdQQWcySndiSzN0N1lhb1JrX28xa0lNVkFVNmtRZE9qMVFSdnJQMk1WcndWaGdGbWxsa2dSaTkwS3dFdXpwLUNXTE5yRE9kcU9LdW1NcmZYZGhpR2FQUHhTc25kb2c</guid></item><item><title>犹他州诊所的慢性疼痛治疗可能是一些创伤后应激障碍患者的答案- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51381412/utah-clinics-chronic-pain-treatment-could-be-the-answer-for-some-with-ptsd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people lightheartedly joke about "having PTSD" (posttraumatic stress disorder) after unpleasant life experiences. But those who live with this debilitating condition know that it's anything but a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.org/patients-families/ptsd/what-is-ptsd" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;American Psychiatric Association&lt;/a&gt; states that PTSD "is a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, a serious accident, a terrorist act, war/combat, or rape or who have been threatened with death, sexual violence or serious injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can be debilitating and interfere with everyday life. They include feelings of shame, fear, self-destructive behavior, intrusive thoughts, aggressive behavior, distressing dreams, trouble sleeping and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're part of the 3.5% of the U.S. adult population that suffers from PTSD, perhaps you've tried a variety of treatments but these symptoms keep cropping up, lessening your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, now a &lt;a href="https://sterlingpainandspine.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;new treatment&lt;/a&gt; is offering hope to many who thought relief was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: ibreakstock/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the brain's fight-or-flight response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your brain perceives that you're in danger, it activates the fight-or-flight response, which is also known as the acute stress response. &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-fight-or-flight-response-2795194" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Verywell Mind&lt;/a&gt; states that this danger might be something physical, such as a barking dog, or it may be psychological, like preparing to give a big presentation. Sometimes it can be triggered by something that isn't a true threat, but your brain thinks it is. (Phobias are a good example. Someone with claustrophobia — the fear of confined spaces — may feel their heart start to race while riding in an elevator, for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this can serve as a good defense mechanism to protect yourself in harmful situations, some people — including those with PTSD — may suffer from an overactive fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;, "PTSD causes your brain to get stuck in danger mode. Even after you're no longer in danger, it stays on high alert. Your body continues to send out stress signals, which lead to PTSD symptoms. Studies show that the part of the brain that handles fear and emotion (the amygdala) is more active in people with PTSD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this has been your experience, it's time to finally break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How a Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) can ease your troubled mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors and researchers have been working to find a good solution for people who suffer from PTSD. But developing an effective treatment that's safe and fast-acting (with few side effects) has proven difficult. One study published on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34255448/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt; reports that "success rates of PTSD treatments are generally variable, with remission rates that range from 30% to 40%." But now a new treatment called Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) is showing promising results and might just offer the relief people are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGB is a simple outpatient procedure involving an injection into the base of the neck, where the stellate ganglion — a collection of nerves — is located. Since this is connected to the amygdala (the part of the brain that handles fear), it can temporarily subdue the fight or flight response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rti.org/impact/stellate-ganglion-block-new-treatment-ptsd" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;RTI International&lt;/a&gt; launched a randomized, controlled trial of SGB in 2014 and concluded in 2019 that the treatment "is indeed effective" after monitoring patient health outcomes for eight weeks after injections. The study also showed improvement in depression, distress, anxiety, pain and physical and mental functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SGB is a true breakthrough in PTSD treatment," states the nonprofit research institute. "It is a powerful new option for people suffering from PTSD—one that may be more readily accepted by military service members and veterans, for whom the stigma associated with mental healthcare is often a deterrent to seeking treatment. We hope that our study is the first step to healing for millions of veterans and others for whom PTSD symptoms have long been a barrier to a better life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23707834/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;PubMed Central study&lt;/a&gt; concluded that SGB "is a minimally invasive procedure with an excellent safety profile that may provide sustained relief of PTSD symptoms. The procedure may also provide benefit for those who are resistant to psychotropic intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the outlook is positive that SGB can be a safe and effective alternative for PTSD and anxiety treatment. The best way to find out if it's right for you is to &lt;a href="https://sterlingpainandspine.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;consult a medical professional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it's important to seek treatment right away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know suffers from PTSD or severe anxiety, it's important to get medical help as early as possible. Apart from the toll this condition takes on a person's mental health, it can also cause serious physical harm to the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd#:~:text=PTSD%20causes%20your%20brain%20to,active%20in%20people%20with%20PTSD." target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; states that PTSD can cause the hippocampus (the area that controls your memory) to get smaller over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early treatment improves your quality of life in both the short and long term, so don't put off getting the help you need!

The fat-soluble vitamin is crucial to our overall health and does a lot to support our immune system, cell growth, and more, according to Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. She adds that consuming whole foods that contain the vitamin is the best way to make sure you’re getting enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty easy to find foods rich in vitamin A and incorporate them into your diet, whether you’re a vegetarian, vegan, or have no dietary restrictions. The best vitamin A foods are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT jBbAVt"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A is essential for our immune system and keeping our lungs, eyes, and other organs healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way to get your daily vitamin A intake is through whole foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the best vitamin A foods include beef liver, spinach, carrots, and milk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin A for an adult male is 900 mcg, while the dose for females is 700 mcg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef Liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming in as the most vitamin A–rich food, three ounces of pan-fried beef liver &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;contain 6,582 micrograms (mcg)&lt;/a&gt; of the vitamin. That is 731% of the daily value recommended that you should be consuming, so be careful of eating this too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweet Potato&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes also contain a great amount of this vitamin. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH), one whole sweet potato has &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;1,403 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/spinach-magnesium" target="_blank"&gt;Spinach&lt;/a&gt; makes for a great addition to any meal because it is vitamin- and nutrient-rich (think magnesium, along with vitamins A, C, E, and K). In terms of vitamin A content, half a cup of the leafy green contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;573 mcg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another vegetable to consider when looking to up your vitamin A intake is carrots. Half a cup of raw carrots contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;488 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk comes with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/should-adults-drink-milk" target="_blank"&gt;loads of benefits&lt;/a&gt;, such as providing us with the calcium and vitamin D needed for bone health. But it’s also packed with vitamin A. One cup of skim milk contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;149 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain cheeses, like ricotta, can be considered rich sources of vitamin A. According to the NIH, half a cup of ricotta contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;133 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Peppers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love adding a little kick to your meal by way of fresh peppers, you’re in luck; it’s one of the most vitamin A–rich vegetables you can reach for. According to the NIH, half a cup of either sweet or red peppers contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;117 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are an easy addition to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/2-eggs-for-breakfast-for-2-weeks" target="_blank"&gt;any well-balanced meal&lt;/a&gt;, providing protein and many vitamins (like vitamin A). According to the NIH, one hard-boiled egg contains 75 mcg of the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tuna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned fish is more than &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/are-tinned-fish-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;a trendy food moment&lt;/a&gt;, and it is known to be packed with all the nutrients and vitamins you need for optimal health. The NIH lists canned tuna as having &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;20 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s very little that salmon can’t do nutrition-wise, in our opinion. As one of the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day" target="_blank"&gt;healthiest food options&lt;/a&gt; (if you like fish, of course), three ounces of cooked salmon contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20"&gt;59 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chicken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it doesn’t have as high of vitamin A content compared to others on this list (half a chicken breast contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en20" target="_blank"&gt;5 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the vitamin), it still shouldn’t be dismissed. Chicken is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/highest-protein-foods" target="_blank"&gt;great source of protein&lt;/a&gt; and other nutrients and vitamins, which makes it a well-rounded option to have in your meal if you’re looking for a healthy source of animal meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does vitamin A do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A does a lot for the body (and skin). Dieras says that the vitamin is involved in maintaining our immune system; the development and growth of our body cells to help maintain the health of the lungs, eyes, and other organs; and our reproductive systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our skin, vitamin A helps with the antiaging process. The &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/retinol-retinoids-guide-fine-lines-sun-damage-healthy-glow" target="_blank"&gt;most common form of vitamin&lt;/a&gt; A is retinol, which helps boost collagen, reduce acne, brighten complexion, and increase skin-cell turnover to reveal smoother texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin A do you need per day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of vitamin A you can consume: preformed vitamin A and provitamin A. Preformed vitamin A is found in animal products such as dairy, eggs, fish, and organ meats. Provitamin A is found in plants that contain certain types of the antioxidant carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. While it’s all dependent on the person, in general, Dieras says that the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin A for an adult male is 900 mcg (and 700 mcg for females).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin A is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is one of the vitamins that you should be careful about consuming too much of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dieras, the body does store unneeded amounts of vitamin A in the body (instead of getting rid of it through excrement), and there is an upper limit of what is considered to be safe before you start experiencing some major side effects. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, adult males and females &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#en5" target="_blank"&gt;should try not to exceed more&lt;/a&gt; than 3,000 mcg a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 21:33:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE1VNHVWekg3MEpxRU1VWUhpNF9qMzNEaXNuMmw0bXdVTlFsQm1xM210S1R2ZzRyekJySmVzNmUxMFh2XzBseGZjdVd1Vm42dlRRVHVqd2N2Zng</guid></item><item><title>科学家“改善大自然” ，创造强大的抗癌分子- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-improve-on-mother-nature-to-create-powerful-cancer-killing-molecule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

This surprising microbial ally could pave the way for new, more effective cancer treatments. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bacterial molecule enhances chemotherapy. Its synthetic form could inspire new cancer drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international group of researchers, led by teams at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences (LMS), &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7e6f30b7e4ef64741fbc0ecb8d494a99" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/span&gt;, and the University of Cologne, has discovered that bacteria living within tumors can generate a molecule that influences cancer development and enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While microbes are commonly recognized for their roles on the skin or in the gut, more recent findings show that tumors also harbor their own bacterial communities. Scientists are now working to understand how these tumor-associated microbes shape cancer growth and the body’s response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published online in &lt;em&gt;Cell Systems&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reported a major breakthrough: they identified a strong anti-cancer compound made by bacteria linked to colorectal cancer. This discovery opens up new possibilities for therapy, including drugs designed to amplify the benefits of existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery of a bacterial metabolite&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach this finding, the team carried out an extensive screening process, testing more than 1,100 conditions in the microscopic worm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans.&lt;/em&gt; They discovered that &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; produced a molecule known as 2-methylisocitrate (2-MiCit), which could increase the potency of the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer modelling showed that the tumor-associated microbiome (bacteria located in and around tumors) in patients also had the capacity to produce 2-MiCit. To validate these results, the scientists tested the molecule in two additional systems: cultured human cancer cells and a fly model of colorectal cancer. In both cases, 2-MiCit demonstrated strong anti-cancer activity, and in the fly model, it was able to extend lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_496239" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-496239" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-496239" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs.jpg" alt="Artistic Illustration of Microbes, DNA, and Cancer Drugs" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs-400x431.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs-768x828.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs-150x162.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Artistic-Illustration-of-Microbes-DNA-and-Cancer-Drugs-450x485.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-496239" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An artistic representation of tumor-associated microbes impacting the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.

&lt;p&gt;Professor Filipe Cabreiro, head of the Host-Microbe Co-Metabolism group at the LMS, and group leader at the CECAD Research Cluster in Cologne, explains the significance of the discovery: “We’ve known that bacteria are associated with tumors, and now we’re starting to understand the chemical conversation they’re having with cancer cells. We found that one of these bacterial chemicals can act as a powerful partner for chemotherapy, disrupting the metabolism of cancer cells and making them more vulnerable to the drug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How 2-MiCit disrupts cancer cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that 2-MiCit works by inhibiting a key enzyme in the mitochondria (structures inside cells that generate energy for cellular functions) of cancer cells. This leads to &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_a15e5d2ae3fd42fd6258493af70006cf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; damage and activates pathways known to reduce the progression of cancer. This multi-pronged attack weakens the cancer cells and works in synergy with 5-FU. The combination was significantly more effective at killing cancer cells than either compound alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Daniel Martinez-Martinez, postdoctoral researcher at the LMS and first author of the paper, says: “Microbes are an essential part of us. That a single molecule can exert such a profound impact on cancer progression is truly remarkable, and another piece of evidence on how complex biology can be when considering it from a holistic point of view. It is really exciting because we are only scratching the surface of what is really happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with medicinal chemists, the researchers also modified the 2-MiCit compound to enhance its effectiveness. This synthetic version proved even more powerful at killing cancer cells, demonstrating the potential to develop new drugs based on natural microbial products. Filipe adds: “Using the natural microbial product as a starting point, we were able to design a more potent molecule, effectively improving on Mother Nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These exciting discoveries highlight how the cancer-associated microbiome can impact tumor progression, and how metabolites produced by these bacteria could be harnessed to improve cancer treatments. These findings are also important in the context of personalized medicine, emphasizing the importance of considering not only the patient, but also their microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

Olanzapine is pretty common.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Caffeine messes with the body’s ability to break down clozapine, and this can lead to excessively high levels of the medication in the body, Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Bronchodilators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;These medications are often used to treat symptoms of asthma and work by opening up and relaxing the airways in the lungs. “Caffeine and its chemical cousin theophylline have bronchodilator activity, and theophylline was used for decades as a preferred treatment agent for asthma,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. “While caffeine causes bronchodilation, it can also cause similar side effects as other bronchodilator agents, including heart palpitations, tremors, and anxiety. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="19" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Blood pressure medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The caffeine in coffee acts as a stimulant and cause cause your blood pressure to rise for hours after you drink it, Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. “For people who take blood pressure medications like beta-blockers or diuretics, caffeine can reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of those medications,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Something else to consider, per Alan: “People with high blood pressure should monitor their caffeine intake in general. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Cholinesterase inhibitors &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;These medications are used to treat conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. “This has a potential interaction with cholinesterase inhibitors that act in the brain,” Alan says. “The theory is that caffeine ‘tightens’ the blood brain barrier, and less of the drug gets across the blood brain barrier.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;She flags these three drugs as having potential issues with caffeine: rivastigmine (Exelon), galantamine (Razadyne), and donepezil (Aricept).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="25" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;Pseudoephedrine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This medication is used to relieve nasal and sinus congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Pseudoephedrine and caffeine are both stimulant drugs,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. “Taking these drugs simultaneously can result in an increased risk of unwanted stimulant-related side effects, including anxiety, tremors, and heart palpitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Some diabetes medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Alan points out that the data is “mixed” on this one. But caffeine is linked with reduced insulin sensitivity and higher blood glucose levels, Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“The effectiveness of anti-diabetic medications that work primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity, like metformin and GLP-1 agents, may be inhibited by caffeine intake,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="31" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="31.0"&gt; M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="31.1"&gt;ethotrexate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The data is evolving around coffee and this medication, which is used to treat cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“In some studies, caffeine was found to inhibit the anti-inflammatory effects of methotrexate,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. But she points out that the data on this has been mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="34" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;Some osteoporosis medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Oral bisphosphonate medications like alendronate (Fosamax), may not be absorbed well by the body when they’re taken with coffee, Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. “For this reason, alendronate and other oral bisphosphonate drugs should only be taken with water and should never be taken with caffeine-containing beverages,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="36" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;Quinolone antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This class of antibiotics treats a wide range of bacterial infections, including some UTIs and pneumonia. (It includes medications like ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin.) “Caffeine could inhibit breakdown of these antibiotics, leading to potentially increased levels and toxicity,” Alan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="38" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="38.0"&gt;Thyroid medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Caffeine can interfere with the effectiveness of levothyroxine (Synthroid), Alan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;That doesn’t mean you have to skip your coffee, though. “You can still have the coffee, but drink it one hour before or two hours after any of these medications,” Alan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, if you’re on a prescription medication and you’re not sure if it’s OK to have coffee with it, check in with your healthcare provider. They should be able to provide personalized guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 20:34:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPU2NQVWFqRVNoUTU2eGNDZGI5d3lOMVhBczV5Z01yVWZ2RkFtQUUyYlFhVVlGWFNtdDIzbGxXZzIybVgxSHU3WWp5X0lBcS0yc3oxSlpmYkJNNzVNZVVuUjcyMlJsMk14aVdjNFl1SkZZN0VYdWpZSEdGa1Y4NFNvdlVn</guid></item><item><title>H3N2流感在印度北部德里迅速蔓延- DW</title><link>https://www.dw.com/en/h3n2-influenza-spreads-rapidly-in-delhi-northern-india/a-74154442</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-tracking-name="rich-text" data-tracking-skip="true" class="c17j8gzx rc0m0op r1ebneao s198y7xq rich-text l1evdo4u blt0baw s16w0xvi rcjjkz7 w128axg5 b1fzgn0z"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern India, in particular the Delhi metropolitan region, is experiencing a significant spike in infections with the H3N2 strain of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/influenza/t-71362030"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; this autumn. There are about 46 million people in the conurbation around the Indian capital, which extends across many neighboring towns and districts in the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.localcircles.com/a/press/page/delhi-influenza" title="External link — to a survey"&gt;to a survey&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the community-based social media platform LocalCircles, 69% of households in the area currently have at least one person with flu-like symptoms. Doctors say H3N2 is currently the predominant influenza variant in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The increasing numbers make it clear that the virus is circulating extensively," Dr. Rituja Ugalmugle, a consultant at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai Central, told the newspaper Indian Express. Reports of growing numbers of cases are also coming in from other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who's at risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H3N2 infections often start with a sudden high fever, shivering, a sore throat and a runny nose. Other symptoms may include a dry or productive cough, bad headaches, aching arms and legs, muscle pains, and severe fatigue and weakness. Some patients, particularly children, may lose their appetite, feel nauseous, or have gastro-intestinal problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children, the elderly, pregnant people, and people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart issues tend to be hit hardest. In most cases, disease progression is that of a typical but nasty flu, and patients usually recover within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infection can lead to serious complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a worsening of existing heart or lung conditions. Hospitals report that many people exhibit symptoms for an extended period or become so sick that they have to be admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unlike the common cold or regular flu, H3N2, which is &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bird-flu-swine-flu-a-guide-to-h5n1-viruses-and-beyond/a-69367069"&gt;a subtype of Influenza A&lt;/a&gt;, is often more severe and tends to last longer," Dr. Mayanka Lodha Seth of Redcliffe Labs told the Indian Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infection becomes dangerous if the patient starts to have difficulty breathing or develops chest pains, their lips or nails turn blue, they become confused, or they are very dehydrated. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should get treatment immediately. They should also seek urgent medical assistance if they have a high fever after being treated for several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Necessary H3N2 precautions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/covid-19/t-62123668"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, doctors recommend frequent hand-washing, masking, avoiding crowds, maintaining a balanced diet and getting the latest annual &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/new-vaccines-show-promise-against-seasonal-h5n1-flu-strains/a-71111141"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no specific therapy for H3N2. Doctors will usually treat the patient's symptoms with bed rest, plenty of fluids, and medicine to lower the fever. Serious cases and high-risk patients may be given anti-viral medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The current seasonal H3N2 emerged from the 1968 influenza pandemic. It developed by combining with an &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bird-flu-us-livestock-human-risk-2025/a-70988147"&gt;avian H3 virus&lt;/a&gt;," said Dr. Martin Beer, vice president of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut (FLI), Germany's Federal Institute for Animal Health. "So the adaptation processes took place a long time ago, and the 'avian' components, like H3, are from that time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, numerous variants of the H3N2 subtype have circulated globally. They return periodically as waves of seasonal flu, often with regional genetic mutations. "Annual circulation and immune pressure result in the adaptation of seasonal flu viruses, and we respond to them with new vaccines. So these days, with the seasonal H3N2 virus, it's no longer a case of adaptation from avian to human, but of continual optimization within the human host," Beer told DW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="74120168" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/74120168_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Five red-colorized blobs of virus against a dark-blue background "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The H3N2 subtype of the influenza A virus under the microscope&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: NIH-NIAID/BSIP/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312824000076" title="External link — study published in February 2024"&gt;study published in February 2024&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examined changes in the receptor specificity of H3N2 influenza viruses from 1990 through 2000. It found that the binding behavior of the human H3N2 influenza virus to human receptors had changed over the last few decades, leading to an extension of the receptor-binding site. This extension makes it easier for the virus to adapt to new hosts or tissue, and can increase transmissibility. It also makes it easier for the virus to evade both &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/immune-system/t-66950642"&gt;immune defenses&lt;/a&gt; and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fifty years of evolution leave visible and comprehensible traces of adaptation," Beer said. "The first, and most important, shift happened 50 years ago, and led to the pandemic at the time. Since then, H3N2 has returned in seasonal waves and at differing levels of intensity. In some years, in some regions, it's very dominant compared to other influenza variants, which can lead to a correspondingly high number of cases."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments by monitors and the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that there is &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/influenza-updates/2025/202536_who-respiratory-virus-update_544.pdf?sfvrsn=34883378_1&amp;amp;download=true" title="External link — currently a low risk of a pandemic"&gt;currently a low risk of a pandemic&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provided there is no significant change in the structure of the virus and its transmission pathways. However, influenza viruses such as H3N2 are capable of mutating very quickly, so officials are remaining vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should H3N2 mutate in such a way as to become more transmissible from human to human, or able to evade existing immunity, it could spread suddenly and quickly, which could lead to an epidemic or pandemic. Scientists therefore keep a very close eye on influenza viruses so they can react to worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed data from almost 500 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across six countries. Patients who inhaled heparin were half as likely to require ventilation and had a significantly lower risk of dying compared with those receiving standard care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparin, a drug traditionally injected to treat blood clots, was tested in this study in an inhaled form, targeting the lungs directly. As well as acting as an anticoagulant, heparin has anti-inflammatory and pan-antiviral properties. Earlier research results showed breathing and oxygen levels improved in COVID-19 patients after they inhaled a course of heparin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the drug could also be useful in fighting other serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Clive Page, Emeritus Professor of Pharmacology at King's who co-led the international study with ANU's Professor van Haren, said: "Inhaled heparin is anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant. There's no other drug that has that unique combination. We know it's only a matter of time until the next pandemic, and there are still COVID-19 patients who get very sick. This is a great weapon to have up our sleeve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings highlight the potential of inhaled heparin, further development is required before the treatment can be routinely adopted. The researchers believe the drug could also be useful in fighting other serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia, which can be caused by a range of viruses and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor van Haren, the drug would also be helpful for those with a compromised immune system, such as cancer patients, when they experience a respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Frank van Haren, lead author, ANU and Director of the Intensive Care Unit at the St George Hospital in Sydney, said: "It doesn't matter what kind of respiratory infection the patient is dealing with, the drug -- when inhaled -- will stop it from infecting the patient and from damaging the lungs. We're aiming to conduct another trial in Europe to confirm its effectiveness in fighting other common respiratory infections such as influenza and RSV. And because it's inexpensive, it's much more accessible for those from low-income countries"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now also developing an improved formulation of heparin, specifically designed to be given by inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;

Any rise in the thickness of this artery is generally associated with atherosclerosis, plaque buildup, and cardiovascular risk like heart attack or stroke. The diminution of CIMT as seen reflects reversal or retardation of the arterial plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of whole pomegranate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant part of the research was the employment of the seeds. Unlike most commercial pomegranate juices that don't contain the fibrous seed component, the research was conducted on juice or extract with whole fruit, including the seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5977444/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#s6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Pomegranate seeds &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are richly polyphenol, containing punicalagins and ellagic acid, both of which have been studied intensively for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are most likely to play a key role in suppressing the oxidative stress in arterial walls, ensuring healthy endothelial function, and slowing the development of plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Arteries and plaque buildup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arterial plaque consists of cholesterol, fatty deposits, calcium, and cellular waste. This becomes hardened as time progresses, narrowing the arteries and denying blood circulation. As the plaque accumulates, the intima-media layer of the walls of the arteries thickens and may be measured with ultrasound-based CIMT scans. Thickened intima-media is an established early indicator of cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduction of CIMT by 35 percent is an impressive finding, and that dietary intake of certain whole-food nutrients may influence long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes seems to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A natural approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Fernando described the effect of compounded pomegranate juice as being like "Drainex in the human body," referencing its potential role to assist the natural ability of the body to dissolve arterial deposits. Although not an exact simile, the term is a reference to the fruit's potential detoxifying effect on the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily drinking of pomegranate juice containing seeds can be an adjunct strategy for those concerned with high cholesterol, arterial plaque, or overall cardiovascular well-being. It should be noted here, though, that these types of dietary changes need to be one facet of a broader heart-healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, balanced nutritional intake, and medical oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical application&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reap optimal health benefits, pomegranate juice should be prepared fresh at home from the entire seeds. Juicing the arils (the red, juicy flesh of the seeds) with a small amount of water or lemon juice helps maintain the fiber and phytonutrients of the seeds. Filtered, sweetened commercial juices might not provide similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy dieticians and practitioners can, as a preventive measure, recommend whole pomegranate juice blend to their clients at risk for cardiovascular disease, particularly patients with higher values of CIMT or family history of arterial plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 18:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，一个日常习惯正在悄悄地增加您患心脏病的风险- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/one-daily-habit-cardiologists-quietly-145000672.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to heart disease, there’s a lot you can do to lower your risk. &lt;a href="https://world-heart-federation.org/what-we-do/prevention/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, 80% of heart disease is preventable by having healthy diet and lifestyle habits in place.

To put it plainly, sitting for too long every day increases your risk of high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, stroke and cardiovascular death even if you feel fine right now. The damage builds slowly and quietly over the years,” says &lt;a href="https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/ramy-doss/512285" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ramy Doss, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ramy Doss, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a cardiologist with Banner Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmonashah.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mona Shah, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Mona Shah, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; who is board-certified in cardiology and holistic medicine, also says that spending the majority of the day sitting is detrimental to heart health. She explains that sitting for a prolonged period of time&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36267589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leads to a decrease in nitric oxide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; leads to a decrease in nitric oxide&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that helps regulate arteries. This, Dr. Shah explains, causes more oxidation in the body, which causes more inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/day-of-heart-healthy-eating-according-to-a-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Dr. Shah says that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565813/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:being sedentary can lead to weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;being sedentary can lead to weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause type 2 diabetes, a health condition directly correlated with heart attacks and heart disease. “When we spend hours on end sitting, our body’s metabolism slows, blood flow becomes sluggish and enzymes involved in breaking down fats are less active. Over time, this increases the risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and elevated blood sugar levels, all known culprits in the development of heart disease,” says Dr. Doss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can an Intense Workout Make Up for Sitting All Day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no debate that spending the majority of the day being sedentary is detrimental to heart health, but can you make up for it by doing an intense workout in the morning or evening? Both cardiologists say that this can help, but it can’t undo the damage entirely. “Working out or exercising once a day of course is going to help, however, it mitigates risk by only a little,” Dr. Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Doss says to think of it this way: “If you were to smoke a cigarette in the morning, then eat healthy the rest of the day, would that completely cancel out the harm from the cigarette? Probably not. Similarly, if you exercise hard for an hour but then sit for 10 to 12 hours straight, the benefits of that workout are being partially undone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-many-minutes-should-you-walk-per-day-to-boost-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah says that NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) plays a major role in heart health. She explains that running errands, housework, yard work and going for a walk are all forms of NEAT, which supports heart health by improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure, cortisol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cardiologists emphasize that exercise is great, but it’s not a complete antidote to sitting. “Research has shown that even individuals who meet or exceed the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week still have higher cardiovascular risk if they sit for long, uninterrupted periods throughout the day,” Dr. Doss says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways To Work More Movement Into Your Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you know why it’s important to consistently move your body throughout the day comes the big question: How can you make it happen? Both cardiologists say to think about ways to increase your NEAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Dr. Doss says that taking walking meetings and phone calls, parking farther away from entrances, doing squats when brushing your teeth and taking the stairs instead of the elevator are all ways to increase your NEAT. He also recommends setting a timer to take a two-minute movement break every 30 minutes or one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key is consistency. Think of movement as something to sprinkle throughout your day, not just something you do in a single block of time. The heart thrives when the body is in motion,” Dr. Doss says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Doss emphasizes that movement is medicine. “Heart health isn't just about big actions. It’s about small, consistent ones,” he says. Focusing on finding more ways to move your body now means a healthier heart in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-packaged-foods-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: 'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: 'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/daily-habit-quietly-raising-heart-disease-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.
