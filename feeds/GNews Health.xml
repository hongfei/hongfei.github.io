Some experts are pretty worried about a new flu variant making its way to Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;So now is the time to take the steps to protect you and your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Many schools across the nation closed early for winter break because of an onslaught of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Mother of two, Audrey Garrett, says flu-like symptoms hit her family hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We actually are just coming back from being sick. He caught a fever. My daughter had that nasty cough, you know that honking cough at night," Garrett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Last year was a pretty bad seasonal flu year for Los Angeles, so it is scary to hear that this year might be worse," Dr. Dawn Tereshita said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Tereshita monitors acute communicable disease at L.A.

			&lt;p&gt;Stuck in front of our screens all day, we often ignore our senses beyond sound and vision. And yet they are always at work. When we're more alert, we feel the rough and smooth surfaces of objects, the stiffness in our shoulders, the softness of bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we may feel the tingle of toothpaste, hear and feel the running water in the shower, smell the shampoo, and later the aroma of freshly brewed  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="186802" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aristotle told us there were &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184311"&gt;five senses&lt;/a&gt;. But he also told us the world was made up &lt;a href="https://www.cabinet.ox.ac.uk/fifth-element-and-medieval-cosmology-2"&gt;of five elements&lt;/a&gt;, and we no longer believe that. And modern research is showing we may actually have dozens of senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-scientist-reveals-5-amazing-facts-about-your-sense-of-smell"&gt;A Scientist Reveals 5 Amazing Facts About Your Sense of Smell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all of our experience &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/senses-1914"&gt;is multisensory&lt;/a&gt;. We don't see, hear, smell, and touch in separate parcels. They occur simultaneously in a unified experience of the world around us and of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we feel affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/22134808-bja10003"&gt;what we see&lt;/a&gt;, and what we see affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00725"&gt;what we hear&lt;/a&gt;. Different odours in shampoo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329309000202"&gt;can affect how you&lt;/a&gt; perceive the texture of hair. The fragrance of roses makes hair seem silkier, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odours in low-fat yogurts can make them feel richer and thicker on the palate without adding more emulsifiers. Perception of odours &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394006010020"&gt;in the mouth&lt;/a&gt;, rising to the nasal passage, is modified by the viscosity of the liquids we consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186808" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_eating_yoghurt_642.jpg" alt="child eating yoghurt" class="wp-image-186808 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_eating_yoghurt_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_eating_yoghurt_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186808" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The odours of liquids in our mouth affect how they feel.

Our sense of balance draws on the &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ear/The-physiology-of-balance-vestibular-function"&gt;vestibular system&lt;/a&gt; of ear canals as well as sight and proprioception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is interoception, by which we sense changes in our own bodies, such as a slight increase in our heart rate and hunger. We also have a sense of agency when moving our limbs: a feeling that can go missing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.14"&gt;in stroke patients&lt;/a&gt; who sometimes even believe someone else is moving their arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/2/390/7319594"&gt;sense of ownership&lt;/a&gt;. Stroke patients sometimes feel their arm is not their own, for instance, even though they may still feel sensations in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the traditional senses are combinations of several senses. Touch, for instance, involves pain, temperature, itch, and tactile sensations. When &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403_supp/full/486S6a.html"&gt;we taste something&lt;/a&gt;, we are actually experiencing a combination of three senses: touch, smell, and taste – or gustation – which combine to produce the flavours we perceive in food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustation covers sensations produced by receptors on the tongue that enable us to detect salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami (savoury). What about mint, mango, melon, strawberry, raspberry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have raspberry receptors on the tongue, nor is raspberry flavour some combination of sweet, sour, and bitter. There is no taste arithmetic for fruit flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We perceive them through the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/smell-triggers-the-same-brain-response-as-taste-does-even-if-you-havent-eaten-anything-264922"&gt;combined workings&lt;/a&gt; of the tongue and the nose. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11121686"&gt;It is smell&lt;/a&gt; that contributes the lion's share to what we call tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not inhaling odours from the environment, though. Odour compounds are released as we chew or sip, travelling from the mouth to the nose through the nasal pharynx at the back of the throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/sn5ora556nerbd2gwndzdut5t4"&gt;Touch plays its part too&lt;/a&gt;, binding tastes and smells together and fixing our preferences for runny or firm eggs, and the velvety, luxurious gooeyness of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sight is influenced by our vestibular system. When you are on board an aircraft on the ground, look down the cabin. Look again when you are in the climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will "look" to you as though the front of the cabin is higher than you are, although optically, everything is in the same relation to you as it was on the ground. What you "see" is the combined effect of sight and your ear canals telling you that you are tilting backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186809" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186809" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/aircraft_cabin_seats_642.jpg" alt="aircraft cabin" class="wp-image-186809 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/aircraft_cabin_seats_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/aircraft_cabin_seats_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186809" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The rise of the aisle in an aircraft cabin is determined by your vestibular system.

We discovered how modifying the sound of your own footsteps can make your body feel lighter or heavier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learned how audioguides in the Tate Britain art museum that address the listener as if the model in a portrait was speaking enable visitors to remember more visual details of the painting. We discovered how aircraft noise interferes with our perception of taste and why you should always drink tomato juice on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our perception of salt, sweet, and sour is reduced in the presence of white noise, umami is not, and tomatoes and tomato juice are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2044-7248-3-2"&gt;rich in umami&lt;/a&gt;. This means the aircraft's noise will enhance the savoury flavour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyve-identified-an-unknown-taste-in-human-cells"&gt;Scientists Think They've Identified an Unknown Taste in Human Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At our latest interactive exhibition, &lt;a href="https://www.kingscross.co.uk/event/club-curling"&gt;Senses Unwrapped&lt;/a&gt; at Coal Drops Yard in London's King's Cross, people can discover for themselves how their senses work and why they don't work as we think they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the size-weight illusion is illustrated by a set of small, medium, and large curling stones. People can lift each one and decide which is heaviest. The smallest one feels heaviest, but people can then place them on balancing scales and discover that they are all the same weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are always plenty of things around you to show how intricate your senses are, if you only pause for a moment to take it all in. So next time you walk outside or savour a meal, take a moment to appreciate how your senses are working together to help you feel all the sensations involved.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270697/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Kennedy Jr. has broad powers to shape federal vaccine policy. In June, he &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/kennedy-removes-all-acip-members-eyes-replacements"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of an influential panel on immunization policy, then handpicked their replacements. In August, he &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/cdc-director-fired-after-she-refused-rubber-stamp-kennedys-vaccine-directives"&gt;fired the director&lt;/a&gt; of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after they clashed over vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even Kennedy’s authority has limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a unilateral decision to scrap the US pediatric immunization schedule and replace it with recommendations from Denmark, as Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/health/hhs-childhood-vaccine-changes"&gt;was reportedly ready&lt;/a&gt; to do last week, requires far more than a press conference, legal experts told CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other agency heads must obey the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a law passed by Congress that requires federal officials to follow an open, deliberative process when issuing rules and regulations, said Lawrence Gostin, JD, founding director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a matter of law, Secretary Kennedy has final authority to make federal policy,” Gostin said. “But he must follow a reasoned process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A drive to reduce the number of vaccinations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s announcement was canceled at the last minute. Although the HHS office of public affairs blamed a scheduling conflict, Politico has reported that Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/20/rfk-kennedy-danish-vaccine-schedule-denmark-00701999"&gt;backed off from a plan to overhaul&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine schedule—which had been described to the press as an “announcement regarding children’s health”— after advisers told him it was legally and politically risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email to media, HHS suggested the press conference would be rescheduled, noting that it was “postponing our children's health announcement to after the first of the new year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for HHS declined to confirm that Kennedy planned to overhaul the vaccine schedule at the press conference. “Unless you hear it from HHS directly, this is pure speculation,” spokesman Andrew Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, has made no secret of his eagerness to revamp the immunization schedule. After President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/aligning-united-states-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;issued a memo earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; directing HHS to align the vaccination schedule with that of countries such as Denmark, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1997104582128754854?s=20"&gt;posted on X,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;Thank you, Mr. President. We’re on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy needs to proceed cautiously to prevent any policy changes from being dismissed by a judge, said Dorit Reiss,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;PhD, a law professor at the University of California Law, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of law, Secretary Kennedy has final authority to make federal policy....But he must follow a reasoned process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the APA, courts can “hold unlawful and &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706"&gt;set aside agency action&lt;/a&gt;, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply holding a press conference to announce that the United States will now recommend Denmark’s vaccine schedule would leave the Trump administration “very, very vulnerable to an arbitrary and capricious claims,” Reiss said. “Short videos simply don't do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Following established procedures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six decades, vaccine recommendations have been formulated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which normally votes on national recommendations after reviewing medical evidence and soliciting input from experts and the public. The CDC director can accept or reject those recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s recommendations are not mandates. Even if Kennedy were to switch the current vaccine recommendations to match those of Denmark, states would not have to follow along. Although CDC recommendations carry great weight, states make individual decisions about school vaccine requirements, Gostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court is likely to take a dim view of any federal vaccine policy changes that don’t go through the ACIP, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the administration wants to follow Denmark’s example, “they need to address the major issues and explain why they are changing from a schedule developed in a deliberative manner over years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump’s memo carries little to no legal weight, Reiss added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The president's memo is not cover, because the will of the president is not enough to justify a change of position under Supreme Court jurisprudence,” Reiss said. “The agency also has to justify the decision on the merits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legal challenges to Trump administration policy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous lawsuits filed against the Trump administration in recent months claim that he and federal agency heads have violated the APA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other medical groups, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/medical-groups-sue-hhs-kennedy-over-covid-vaccine-policy-changes"&gt;filed a law suit against Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; in July claiming that he violated the APA when he &lt;a href="https://litigationtracker.law.georgetown.edu/litigation/american-academy-of-pediatrics-et-al-v-robert-f-kennedy-jr-et-al/"&gt;issued a directive&lt;/a&gt; removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC immunization schedule for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The concerns and legal issues all come back to whether he followed a process and looked at evidence,” said Richard H. Hughes IV, JD, MPH, who teaches vaccine law at George Washington University and represents the AAP and other plaintiffs in their lawsuit against Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous medical societies and public health groups &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/pediatricians-reject-cdc-advisers-guidance-plan-continue-vaccinating-all"&gt;have criticized Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and the ACIP for more recent changes to the vaccination schedule, such as removing a recommendation to routinely vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B. Scientists and public health advocates predict that decision &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/doctor-groups-form-united-front-against-rfk-jr-s-efforts-limit-vaccine-access"&gt;will allow many children to suffer&lt;/a&gt; and die needlessly from a vaccine-preventable illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Kennedy “nor the ACIP is taking the proper steps to evaluate the full range of evidence that is normally reviewed prior to recommendation changes,” Hughes said. “All of that is textbook ‘arbitrary and capricious’ under the Administrative Procedure Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean that Kennedy can’t find other ways to alter the vaccine schedule, Gostin noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If he follows a deliberative process, the ultimate decision is his,” Gostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the APA could be interpreted to mean that Kennedy needs to work with the ACIP to change vaccine recommendations, “that is not a high bar for Kennedy since he handpicked ACIP's members,” Gostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justifying a change to vaccine recommendations would be easier than changing federal regulations, a process that typically takes months and includes proposals and opportunities for public comments, Gostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy “would have even more onerous procedures to follow if he proposed a legal regulation,” Gostin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And medicine is a business, which means doctors can be overworked, pressed for time and dismissive of patient complaints, &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/katz-institute-for-womens-health/articles/gaslighting-in-womens-health" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="especially if that patient is a woman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694b0046e4b0d09497f9e0b1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.northwell.edu/katz-institute-for-womens-health/articles/gaslighting-in-womens-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;especially if that patient is a woman&lt;/a&gt;. In my case, the casual dismissal of my symptoms almost cost me my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was October 2019 when my new OB-GYN ― let’s call her Dr. Can’t Be Bothered ― gave me what I considered to be life-changing news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have a two-centimeter tumor on your uterine cervix,” she said, without even a hint of concern. For me, those words felt like a knife to the gut. A tumor? Me? How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then her phone rang, and she left the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time she returned, tears had welled up in my eyes. “Do I have cancer?” I asked, terrified and confused. As a non-doctor, when I hear the word “tumor,” my first thought is cancer. Hers was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, no,” Dr. Can’t Be Bothered assured me. “This is not how cancer behaves.” Then she added a sentence I’ll never forget: “For you to have cancer at this age, with this medical history, it would be like winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not make me feel better. She seemed unconcerned about the tumor growing in my pelvis, but I was not. She explained I would need a biopsy, but assured me it was probably fibroids, a benign growth, maybe a polyp, or a million other little non-cancer things. I would have to go under anesthesia for the biopsy, and it would be an “all-day” affair. Not wanting this tumor-thingy hanging over my head, I asked to schedule the surgery as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. CBB once again told me there was no rush, even though the radiology report stated the tumor was “of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, she was going on vacation for two weeks and her schedule was full. We would have to put off the procedure for at least four weeks. I asked if I could get in sooner ― perhaps a different doctor could perform the biopsy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not necessary,” she said. “Just be patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“I let it go ― after all, she'd gone to medical school and I hadn't. She wore a white coat, and I was a 34-year-old whose work wardrobe still included yoga pants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She made me feel like I was overreacting, like I was ignorant of how “these things work.” I peppered her with questions about the Big C, to which she kept saying, “No, no, that’s not how cancer behaves.” I let it go ― after all, she’d gone to medical school and I hadn’t. She wore a white coat, and I was a 34-year-old whose work wardrobe still included yoga pants. It was not my place to argue with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my drive home I called my mother. I explained everything the doctor told me, but I couldn’t stop crying. I felt that something was wrong ― like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wrong. And I was angry the doctor wasn’t taking this seriously. My mother agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On instinct, I called up my old OB-GYN. Sobbing, I explained my situation and begged for an urgent appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to certain cancers, time matters. Forty-eight hours later I was once again sitting in a doctor’s office, only this time, it was a completely different experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My old doctor spoke to me with kindness and concern. He explained exactly what the ultrasound revealed, and went over all the tests he was about to perform, including another ultrasound, a colposcopy, and an in-office biopsy with no anesthesia and no surgery required. He even said to me, “I know you’re scared, but we’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; won the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biopsy revealed I had a &lt;a href="https://tarynhillin.medium.com/a-rare-cancer-thats-killing-young-women-and-no-one-knows-how-to-cure-dc4a4d91d9ed" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="very rare cancer called high-grade small-cell neuroendocrine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694b0046e4b0d09497f9e0b1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://tarynhillin.medium.com/a-rare-cancer-thats-killing-young-women-and-no-one-knows-how-to-cure-dc4a4d91d9ed" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;very rare cancer called high-grade small-cell neuroendocrine&lt;/a&gt;. I would need a radical hysterectomy ― where they remove the uterus, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, a third of the vaginal canal, and multiple pelvic lymph nodes ― along with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, my entire world turned upside down. It was an onslaught of appointments, scans, and hard bathroom-floor crying. My imaging showed only “local disease,” which means it had not metastasized to other parts of my body. My surgical oncologist said she was relieved. “Often patients with neuroendocrine cancer walk in at stage 4 ― it’s that aggressive,” she said. “You’re lucky you came when you did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her husband, Max Gamble, after she completed chemotherapy for stage 3C neuroendocrine cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, that’s an understatement. Even with the quick biopsy, I ended up at stage 3C. My odds of survival were a mere &lt;a href="https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/29/6/986" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="0% to 7%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694b0046e4b0d09497f9e0b1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/29/6/986" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;0% to 7%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, high-grade small-cell neuroendocrine cancer is highly aggressive, with poor prognosis rates. Even at stage 1, the survival rate is only about 30%. The time between my scans, which showed local disease, and my surgery, which found cancer in one lymph node, was just five days. Had I waited for Dr. CBB to care about my condition, I would have been stage 4 at diagnosis and probably dead now. Median survival is less than 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, after my surgery was completed, I finally got a call from Dr. Couldn’t Be Bothered’s office. They wanted to schedule the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;biopsy she’d put off. I laughed. “Are you kidding me?” I asked. “I’m about to start chemotherapy!” Then I angrily hung up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I am lucky to be alive. I have now been cancer-free for two years. My oncologist recently said I was a “miracle.” In order for me to survive this cancer, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; had to go my way. I was fortunate that the second doctor I saw spent over an hour with me, listened to my concerns, tested me for everything on the spot and cared enough to pay attention to me. If my surgery, chemotherapy or radiation had been delayed by four weeks ― as Dr. CBB wanted ― it would have cost me my life. Instead, a team of doctors stepped up and recognized a needle-in-a-haystack cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My intention is not to vilify doctors, but rather the system they are forced to operate in. According to studies, 56% of primary care physicians &lt;a href="https://mobius.md/2021/10/09/how-much-time-do-physicians-spend-with-patients/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="spend less than 16 minutes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694b0046e4b0d09497f9e0b1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mobius.md/2021/10/09/how-much-time-do-physicians-spend-with-patients/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;spend less than 16 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with patients, and much of that time is &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/for-each-patient-visit-physicians-spend-about-16-minutes-ehrs-study-finds" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="spent filling out electronic health records" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694b0046e4b0d09497f9e0b1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/for-each-patient-visit-physicians-spend-about-16-minutes-ehrs-study-finds" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;spent filling out electronic health records&lt;/a&gt;.

We have to fight to get tests, labs and appointments, all while being labeled pushy, hysterical and overdramatic. And don’t even get me started on weight stigma. News flash: Not every condition can be solved by losing weight (cancer comes to mind). What’s more, too many women (and too many people in general) don’t have access to insurance, affordable health care or the resources and time to take advantage of it, but that’s a whole other battle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, if battling a rare and deadly cancer has taught me anything, it’s to never stop fighting for yourself. I spent countless hours fighting with insurance, begging labs and imaging centers for earlier appointments, and emailing every oncologist in the country for help. It’s your health, and your life. If you have to ruffle a few white-coated feathers, so be it.

This opens up a lot of new directions for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Implantation takes place a week or so after fertilisation when the developing embryo attaches and then embeds itself into the uterus wall. It is a crucial phase in pregnancy, but the process is poorly understood because it is so hard to observe. Much of what is known comes from studies of hysterectomies that were performed in early pregnancy more than half a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To build the replica womb lining, Rugg-Gunn and his colleagues obtained uterine tissue from healthy women who donated biopsy samples. From this, the scientists isolated two different types of cells: stromal cells that give structural support to the womb lining, and epithelial cells, which form the lining’s surface. They encapsulated the stromal cells in a biodegradable material called a hydrogel and put the epithelial cells on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers tested the engineered womb lining with donated early-stage IVF embryos. Writing in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01232-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, they describe how the microscopic balls of cells attached and implanted as hoped. They then ramped up secretion of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the biochemical marker detected by pregnancy tests, along with other pregnancy-related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The technique enabled scientists to watch embryos grow for up to 14 days post-fertilisation, the legal limit for research. During the process, the embryos formed specialised cells and other cells involved in the growth of the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To understand the process more deeply, the scientists zoomed in on the spots where embryos had embedded in the engineered womb lining and decoded the molecular signals that passed back and forth. Such signals are critical for achieving and maintaining a healthy pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:9,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="77432e95-1196-4fe5-b3b3-287a709945f5" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Equivalent of one child in every British classroom now born via IVF, data shows","elementId":"77432e95-1196-4fe5-b3b3-287a709945f5","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/one-child-every-british-classroom-born-via-ivf-fertility"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists will now use the approach to investigate how pregnancies become established and what can go awry. “We know that half of all embryos fail to implant and we have no idea why,” Rugg-Gunn said. Finding answers could provide a much-needed boost to IVF success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further experiments will explore what happens after implantation when the placenta starts to form. Many serious complications of pregnancy are thought to arise at this stage. In the study, the researchers used a chemical to block a particular signal between the embryo and the lining, producing severe defects in the tissue that forms the placenta, demonstrating its power for testing the impact of signalling problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01230-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal, Chinese researchers created their own replica womb lining and identified drugs that might improve implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF), where good-quality IVF embryos fail to establish a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Aplin, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Manchester, said that during 40-plus years of assisted reproduction, implantation rates had remained stubbornly low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As the embryo implants, a programme is initiated to begin development of the placenta, which will supply nutrients and oxygen to the foetus,” he said. “The earliest stages are crucial to the progression of the pregnancy, are not well understood, and frequently fail. This work will allow treatments to be explored that seek to improve implantation efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxObGxvOTVkbnRQd2dtZWxQbTBuRWxJYnEzQkZMSERVaDNXdmVKTTZ0ak85NXcyc2U3eHZpa0x4RlJPT3Fqc2pJUXpLTVJ4UnIxYU1WLVBlMHRIUnc2N3Rud1hSaHhITjVvOU80SVFRcnIxY2NObzFiZWlhWFpkRmF5YnBEWUxXWURGaE45MWhSSmNlRXg2R1l1SWlIbGgyemhFWmNYa1RCajhaM3ZFRTBrOG4yWlJ2a0hUSkltN0g3eTg</guid></item><item><title>不考虑任何事情：迈向心灵消失的大脑特征- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-brain-signature-mind-blanking.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fueled by a new viral strain, flu is hitting California early — and doctors are warning they expect the season may be particularly tough on young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concentrations of flu detected in wastewater have surged in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the test positivity rate is rising in &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/respiratoryvirus" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; and county data. Hospitalizations and emergency room visits for flu are also rising in L.A. and Orange counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at the point now where we’re starting to see a sharp rise in flu cases. This is a few weeks earlier than we usually experience, but very much akin to what was seen in the Southern Hemisphere’s experience with flu during their winter,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician director of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Kaiser, flu cases are primarily being seen in clinics so far, but hospitalizations typically rise after Christmas. “We expect to see the same this year, too,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of cases appears to be higher at an earlier time in the usual flu season than we’ve seen in years past,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu levels are high in San Francisco’s sewage as well as in wastewater across San José, Sunnyvale and Palo Alto, &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; WastewaterSCAN and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/health-information/health-data/respiratory-virus-data" target="_blank"&gt;Santa Clara County Public Health Department&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of concern this winter has been the rise of a relatively new flu subvariant, known as H3N2 Flu A subclade K, which appeared toward the end of summer. That was months after officials decided which strains this fall’s flu vaccine would target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subclade K “is causing an active, early flu season, with more cases occurring in some countries within the Northern Hemisphere,” the California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether subclade K will reduce the efficacy of this year’s flu shot. Data recently released in Britain showed this season’s vaccines were 70% to 75% effective against hospitalization for children from the flu, and 30% to 40% effective in adults, which is within expectations, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank"&gt;noted.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests “that influenza vaccination remains an effective tool in preventing influenza-related hospitalizations this season,” according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the intended effectiveness of the flu vaccine against symptomatic disease caused by the new subvariant remains uncertain, the World Health Organization said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, flu rates in L.A. County remain relatively low, but are on the rise. Across California, flu hospitalizations are likewise low but increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a national level, severity indicators remain low, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the experience in other nations have led some experts to worry &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-11/worst-flu-season-in-5-years-hits-california"&gt;another severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; could be on deck for California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s flu season, which is seasonally opposite from California’s, came far earlier than usual, hit with record strength and was particularly hard on the nation’s children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan, Taiwan and Britain have also reported early spikes to their flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether or not this season will be more severe, only time will tell,” Hudson said of California. “We know that we have a mutation ... which may make the flu vaccine work less well. But the vaccine still offers excellent protection against hospitalization and death, even with the mutated strain in circulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what happened in the Southern Hemisphere — particularly in Australia — “we are expecting this season to have a disproportionate impact on children under the age of 10,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, three flu-associated pediatric deaths have been reported nationally this season, including two &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the flu season that ended in September, 280 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-02/cdc-reports-216-child-deaths-this-flu-season-the-most-in-15-years"&gt;children died from flu&lt;/a&gt; — the most since the swine flu pandemic season of 2009-10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the 2024-25 season was considered the worst flu season since 2017-18, and hit adults hard as well. At least 38,000 people died from the flu &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;, health authorities estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a little more than half of the children who died from flu had an underlying medical condition, and 89% of those who died were not vaccinated, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the children who died from flu last season, the most common &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; experienced before death were shock or sepsis, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, seizures and damage to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of flu can help stave off the worst by giving those who are sick time to take antiviral medications like Tamiflu. Three out of five children who died from the flu during the 2024-25 season never received antiviral medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Emergency warning signs of flu complications&lt;/a&gt; in children include trouble breathing; bluish lips or face; ribs pulling in with each breath; chest pain; severe muscle pain, in which a child may refuse to walk; dehydration, signs of which include no urine for eight hours or no tears when crying; seizures; fevers above 104 degrees that are not controlled by medication; fever or cough that improve but return or worsen; and any fever in newborns younger than 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the official start of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-11-04/during-cold-flu-season-youngest-students-germiest"&gt;the respiratory virus season&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 1, the CDC estimates there have been at least 1,900 flu-related deaths, 49,000 hospitalizations and 4.6 million illnesses nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been urging everybody to get the flu vaccine — the CDC recommends it for everyone age 6 months and up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates have been lagging. Among children age 6 months to 17 years, an estimated 40.8% had been vaccinated as of the first week of December, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Immunization Survey&lt;/a&gt;. In the last season before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination rates were notably higher by this time of year, at 51.2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last flu season, only 49.8% of children and teens had been vaccinated, the survey estimated, down from the 62.4% who had gotten their shots by the end of the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in flu vaccinations has been seen locally, too. “Notably, fewer influenza vaccines have been administered this year compared to the same period last year,” the Orange County Health Care Agency &lt;a class="link" href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/CD-HEALTH-ALERT--2025-2026-Respiratory-Virus-Season-Update---Increasing-Influenza-and-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus--RSV-.html?soid=1128423022889&amp;amp;aid=vDIRaAQ0y1w" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about two weeks for protection to build, but getting vaccinated as soon as possible before travel or seeing friends and family “helps keep you and your loved ones safer,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOZjdYLXk2dFZFRWZoc1JWbHdGRTFPWUs1UlRkSUJ5bFRaTDdLYUV0Smk2bUxHOGtNcnFfVDF1dkk4YURROUdXdnBtVGZaRkRDUVpRcVFiSTZ4VUdCT3VwVkl1cE1MMmdQdXBySGZOaHFVbXVYaVJpSkdhbUpsZlN5Znp1RWFTWE9CMTdDMW9USHktbjY0Y003WUhiT05NZEZ6SXhkMUg5dXBkZWVrVFEzRGJpaU4wOWQydGNn</guid></item><item><title>安德鲁·齐默恩（ Andrew Zimmern ）在食用普通香料后收缩的无法治愈的状况-外卖</title><link>https://www.thetakeout.com/2022093/andrew-zimmern-burning-mouth-syndrome-cumin/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Television host and culinary adventurer Andrew Zimmern has eaten everything from fermented shark in Iceland (&lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1578916/hakarl-shark-meat-anthony-bourdain/" target="_blank"&gt;which Anthony Bourdain refused to eat ever again&lt;/a&gt;) to still-beating snake hearts in Vietnam. But even with all of his experience, he was caught off guard by a painful, lingering condition he says he picked up while filming in northern Africa: burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Sometimes called glossodynia, BMS is characterized by a chronic, often unexplained burning or tingling sensation on the tongue, lips, or entire mouth. In an "Ask Me Anything" event on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3f63r4/comment/ctlown6/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, Zimmern explained what happened: "In 2005, I contracted a virus from eating tainted cumin in Northern Africa. Occasionally once a year I have a flare-up of a rare disease called burning mouth syndrome. I pass it off as a simple casualty of war." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/bizarre-foods-andrew-zimmern-things-famous-tv-chef/story?id=26815920" target="_blank"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, he elaborated further: "I carry medication around with me in case it flares up. It's been about two years since a flare-up, it's viral ... there are only a handful of people in the world who have it." At first, Zimmern believed he'd simply overwhelmed his taste buds — obviously an occupational hazard for someone whose job was once to literally consume weird meats around the world (&lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/andrew-zimmern-picks-the-best-and-worst-tasting-animal-1798251700/" target="_blank"&gt;here are his best- and worst-tasting animals&lt;/a&gt;). But even after returning home, the burning did not subside. Doctors eventually diagnosed him with the neuropathic condition, and its exact causes remain mysterious. Though there's more than a "handful" of people who have it, global estimates suggest that about 1–3% of the world's population experiences the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Ellionn/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But is a tainted spice really to blame? To be sure, cumin is one of the most heavily traded spices in the world, and because it's often sold ground, it is indeed vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional adulteration. The bulk spice is used daily in cuisines across North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America. Often sold in open sacks or scooped loose in outdoor markets, it's certainly possible for it to be exposed to dust, bacteria, and other nasty bits floating through the air. In 2015, one of the largest spice recalls in the U.S. involved cumin contaminated with peanut protein. Perhaps unsurprisingly, undisclosed allergens are actually one of &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1853246/common-reasons-food-recalls/" target="_blank"&gt;the most common reasons foods are recalled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem that Zimmern has slowed down on his spicy foods or changed his adventurous behavior, other than carrying a steroidal rinse in case of flare-ups. He continues to travel and film internationally, but these days his focus is on his current show, "Wild Game Kitchen," where he cooks wild food over an open fire. His spicy experience is certainly a high-profile example of how even seasoned culinary professionals can develop chronic conditions from repeated sensory exposure. Today, North Africa remains one of Zimmern's favorite food regions, and he even still uses cumin in his recipes. But just in case we've scared you from ever using the earthy spice again, we've got &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1754931/cumin-substitute-spices/" target="_blank"&gt;four substitutes for cumin in recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have gotten an unprecedented look at how the human embryo implants in a uterus. They did this by creating very primitive, womb-like environments in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The goal is to help people have healthy babies by finding new clues to the causes of miscarriages and infertility. But the research raises tough ethical concerns. It was &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01232-2" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01230-9" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(25)00436-9" target="_blank"&gt; papers&lt;/a&gt; in the journals &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cell Stem Cell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is really important work that's moving embryo research forward – an important advance in the search for scientific answers for what makes a pregnancy healthy," says &lt;a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/expert/insoo-hyun-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Insoo Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at The Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, who was not involved in the research. "However, it also presents a technology that could be used for other purposes that are concerning."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That includes the possibility of some day using this kind of technology to enable embryos to develop much further – perhaps even completely – in the lab. This process, called ectogenesis, has the potential to make a natural human womb unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is very troubling," says &lt;a href="https://philosophy.wfu.edu/faculty-and-staff/current-faculty/" target="_blank"&gt;Ana Iltis&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at Wake Forest University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the scientists working on this research argue that possibility remains theoretical, and the work could yield important clues to early human development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is very exciting," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/175076/jun-wu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jun Wu&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the most important moments in a human embryo's journey to becoming a baby is when the microscopic ball of cells burrows into the womb. But that pivotal step of embryonic implantation has long been mysterious because it unfolds hidden inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Human implantation is essentially a black box — a mystery," Wu says. "Implantation happens very early on during pregnancy. Essentially we don't know when, we don't know where. It's happening in a womb we cannot have access to."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights into the causes of miscarriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the new research, Wu and colleagues in China obtained cells and tissue collected from the lining of wombs during routine medical procedures and figured out how to recreate a key part of the lining of the womb inside tiny plastic devices in their labs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You can call it: A womb on a chip," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scientists then placed human embryos donated for research after infertility treatments, as well as primitive embryo-like entities created from stem cells — called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/02/516280895/embryo-experiments-reveal-earliest-human-development-but-stir-ethical-debate" target="_blank"&gt;embryoids&lt;/a&gt; — inside their tiny wombs on chips and peered through a microscope to watch what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we observed the entire sequence of human implantation," Wu says. "We are very excited about this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers have already used their wombs on chips to discover clues about how embryos and wombs interact, which can "help us understand the implantation process at the molecular level," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared artificial wombs using cells from healthy wombs with &lt;strong&gt;artificial wombs&lt;/strong&gt; using cells from wombs of women who had miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We observed implantation failure right in front of our eyes, which is very surprising and also exciting," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wu's team even screened more than 1,100 drugs to see if any might prevent miscarriages, and identified some that look promising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A separate team in the U.K. did similar research in their lab in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've been able to observe some really fantastic aspects of human embryo development, many of which have never been seen before," says&lt;a href="https://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/epigenetics/peter-rugg-gunn" target="_blank"&gt; Peter Rugg-Gunn&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the Babraham Institute. "To be able to see these events for the first time, it was fantastic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other scientists hailed the research&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very exciting," says &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/robin-lovell-badge" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Lovell-Badge&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who was not involved in the research. "I think they will allow more information to be developed about this absolutely critical stage of human development which has to date been otherwise pretty much impossible to study."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An ethical slippery slope?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among the difficult ethical issues raised by the research are questions about destroying human embryos for research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"For those of us who believe that humans are humans and deserving of ethical respect, whether embryonic, adolescent, or elderly, these experiments are unethical," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TpfuAAC/daniel-p-sulmasy-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Sulmasy&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgetown University bioethicist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiments also raise questions about using these devices to study human embryos past 14 days of development, which is considered off limits in many places. (The researchers did not use their devices to try that.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about implanting even primitive embryo models created from stem cells into anything that resembles a human womb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some might be concerned with how far this might go," says Hyun, the Hastings Center bioethicist. "It is a little bit on a slippery slope scientifically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indeed some bioethicists are very concerned about how far this may go.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's research that could facilitate future attempts to support not only research on early embryos but on growing embryos for significant periods of time in labs, perhaps eventually to the point of fetuses," says Iltis, the Wake Forest University bioethicist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If that ever became possible, it raises the prospect of producing human fetuses for "spare parts," Iltis says. "They could be grown to be sources of organs and tissues for transplantation. That is very troubling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers doing the work say their research is nowhere near that, and they have no intention to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Development entirely outside the uterus is a science fiction," Wu says. "I don't think we're anywhere close to that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Iltis argues other scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/12/1241895501/artificial-womb-premature-birth" target="_blank"&gt;already testing much larger artificial wombs &lt;/a&gt;to save very premature babies. So what sounds like science fiction today, could become a reality much sooner than many people think.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have this long history of saying, 'Don't worry. The science isn't there. That's not the goal. That's not what we're trying to do.' And then being presented with a breakthrough that signals that the train has left the station."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's far-fetched to think that eventually it might be possible to create lab-generated tissues and organs through something like this technology."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A compound produced by gut bacteria could play a vital role in managing and preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyve-found-a-new-cause-of-type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study led by researchers from Imperial College London (ICL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small molecule, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylamine"&gt;trimethylamine&lt;/a&gt; (TMA), is a major type of bacterial metabolite – a class of chemicals produced naturally through processes of transforming nutrients into energy and building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now found evidence in human cell models and lab mice that TMA could protect the body from some of the damage triggered by a high-fat diet. Specifically, it has the effect of dampening down inflammation and improving insulin response, both of which reduce the risk of type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186331" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/oral-health-and-diabetes-have-a-crucial-link-expert-reveals"&gt;Oral Health And Diabetes Have a Crucial Link, Expert Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1075762"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; had already connected some of the dots between TMA and insulin resistance, though the metabolite's exact role in the chemical conversation between gut microbes and their host wasn't clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a series of experiments designed to screen for individual metabolites and test TMA's ability to mitigate the impacts of high-fat diets on mice and human tissues, the researchers found the abundant microbial chemical may break some of the links in the chain between diabetes, obesity, and low-level inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This flips the narrative," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/medicine/metabolism-digestion-reproduction/2025/microbial-molecule-offers-new-hope-for-diabetes/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ICL biochemist Marc-Emmanuel Dumas.

The researchers demonstrated that increasing choline in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-high-fat-meal-can-disrupt-blood-flow-to-your-brain-study-finds"&gt;high-fat diets&lt;/a&gt; blocked some of its worst consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that TMA inhibits the IRAK4 protein, which usually triggers an inflammatory response when a high-fat diet is detected. In the future, a similar prevention might be replicated through drugs, reducing the degree of inflammation resulting from diets high in fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TMA has also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215689109"&gt;been associated&lt;/a&gt; with cardiovascular disease in earlier studies, in part through the related compound trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – so the twist that it can actually be beneficial to the body is an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of the growing threat of diabetes worldwide and its devastating complications for the whole patient, including the brain and heart, a new solution is direly needed," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/medicine/metabolism-digestion-reproduction/2025/microbial-molecule-offers-new-hope-for-diabetes/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist and professor of medicine Peter Liu, from the University of Ottawa in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our team's work connecting Western-style foods, TMA produced by the microbiome, and its effect on the immune switch IRAK4, may open entirely new ways to treat or prevent diabetes, a known risk factor for heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, and these findings will need to be replicated in human participants over a longer period of time.

&lt;p&gt;The clitoris does a lot more than make sex feel good. And Angela Towne wants it to get the respect it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mainstream understanding of the clitoris has come a long way in recent decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists worked to destigmatize sexual pleasure involving the clitoris. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was really important to do that during second wave feminism,” Towne, a sexuality researcher and educator who &lt;a href="https://siumed.academia.edu/AngelaTowne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;teaches at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;Rewire News Group&lt;/em&gt;, but “now what I see is that it’s being used as a reason to disregard” the clitoris. “‘Oh it’s for pleasure, it has no other purpose, so who cares?’” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Towne’s &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/fro.2023.0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research on the many functions of the clitoris&lt;/a&gt; sheds light on how U.S. society’s male-centered take on sex and gender has affected the traditional dynamics of whose pleasure gets prioritized during sex. That perspective has also skewed what the science shows—biologically—about the clitoris. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RNG &lt;/em&gt;sat down with Towne to set the clitoral record straight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview was conducted by phone and email, and has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else is the clitoris used for, beyond pleasure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clitoris has important safety functions. Greater vaginal lubrication lessens the likelihood of micro-tears and abrasion in the vaginal canal or in the outer vulva, which are potential inroads into the body for sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if I stimulate a clitoris, that stimulation causes greater vaginal lubrication that lessens the likelihood of…viruses and bacteria. … We could include clitoral stimulation in sex education aimed at reducing STI risk because communicating with someone about how they like their clitoris to be touched is going to be protective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clitoris has reproductive support functions as well. So along with creating a safer bodily state for the main reproductive method—which is penile vaginal intercourse—there’s also clitoral stimulation, we find, changes the chemical makeup of vaginal fluid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, vaginal fluid with clitoral stimulation: The vaginal fluid has i&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337111515_The_Clitoris-An_Appraisal_of_its_Reproductive_Function_During_the_Fertile_Years_Why_Was_It_and_Still_Is_Overlooked_in_Accounts_of_Female_Sexual_Arousal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ncreased oxygenation&lt;/a&gt;. That’s just a way of saying oxygen in vaginal fluid increases … but it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.23498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decreases the vaginal acidity&lt;/a&gt;. And both of these things increase sperm longevity and motility. In other words, it increases fertility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think it’s important to make people more aware that the clitoris doesn’t have to solely function for pleasure? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s this [perceived] danger of essentializing reproduction in sexual activity with a partner. I don’t see it that way. What I see is that the clitoris fully functions without penetrative sex at all, without a penis inserted. It’s functional in all stages of sexual response and when somebody chooses to also have reproductive sex, it supports reproduction as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, it quite literally gives a clitoris-haver a choice in that I can use my clitoris in ways that are non-reproductive without any loss in functionality, and I can also use my clitoris in ways that are reproductive and get reproductive support. …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re living in a culture that discourages female pleasure-seeking. This knowledge has been covered up. But if we include the accurate safety features of the clitoris it could potentially legitimize including the clitoris in more disciplines and more areas of study and health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve done a lot of research on the “patriarchal lens” through which we view the clitoris and sexuality. How has this gendered perspective of the clitoris and clitorial anatomy affected how we understand pleasure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s really not some official or objective definition of what a clitoris is. It’s so understudied that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ju.0000173639.38898.cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.22471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disciplines&lt;/a&gt; and sources define the clitoris differently. We may assume that we’re talking about the same thing when we use the word “clitoris,” but in my experience conducting in-depth and interdisciplinary research, that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Ongoing debate over the language used to describe the clitoris and disagreement over which parts of the genitalia should be considered part of the clitoris’ anatomy means, for example, that Towne includes an area called the “perineal sponge,” while other biologists might exclude that region.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patriarchal lens means that female anatomy is viewed from the perspective of the male. Because there is such disagreement about what anatomical sites can be included in what we call a “clitoris,” one rationale that has been used to [answer this question] … is to use the penis as the standard for comparison. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thinking goes: Because the clitoris and penis arise from the same embryo and fetus anatomy, the sites that we define as the “penis” can be included in what we consider to be the “clitoris.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sexism [here] is that the penis is already considered to be a valid structure, as it has been defined, whereas the clitoris has a validity problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And what this does is it takes certain anatomical sites, that from my research are used for pleasure, and says these are not part of the clitoris because they’re not part of the penis. …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if the penis is the standard of comparison it actually erases anatomical sites that we can consider scientifically, biologically, interpersonally, and during masturbation for pleasure purposes. It erases things. It erases knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for people to have inclusive and anatomically correct information about their bodies? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It helps us to make informed decisions in so many different realms—our body, our health, our safety, sex, relationships, reproduction, and pleasure-seeking. We can better communicate about our bodies to health-care providers, to sex partners, to friends in conversation, to sex researchers like me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a sex researcher, I’m thinking about how [when] I encounter a lack of knowledge, it can cut off information because people don’t have a language to describe their experience. … And there is likely so much information that we’re not accessing as a result of not acknowledging the clitoris at all. …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so, [saying the clitoris is only for pleasure has] become a way to put it under the rug and stigmatize it, because female pleasure as a whole is stigmatized. So, to get back to your question, it’s important to have more pleasure, more choice, and less pathologizing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope is in store for the future of sexual pleasure research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would love to see more theory and research about the clitoris. It’s left out of a lot of academic disciplines, it’s even often left out of sex education. I worked as a professor of gender and sexuality studies and it’s left out there. I have so many stories of my research being actively censored in gender and sexuality studies departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more embrace in academic spaces of discussing the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/7365715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;removal of the clitoris&lt;/a&gt; [than there is of looking at what we don’t know yet]… A lot of the sexuality research in academic spaces that gets done is about the vaginal canal … but there’s not an equivalent interest in the clitoris. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But also, what about theory? What about looking at the clitoris using an intersectional lens? What about looking at psychology and mental representation of the clitoris? I’m talking about wide-view theorizing of the clitoris. (&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Towne uses the term called “clitorality” to describe this broad, intersectional focus on the clitoris&lt;/em&gt;.) And I would love to see a ton more research done into intersex, trans, and gender non-conforming experiences of sex and pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do people not talk about when it comes to sex, gender, and pleasure, but you wish they would?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wish that people talked more about how to communicate with partners about how they like their clitoris touched throughout sexual contact. I would love to see realistic media depictions of that. What I see, and what we see, at least in movies and TV, is people running towards each other and then it flips to the day after. … There’s very little representation of how we communicate with partners about how we want our clitorises touched. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I asked that question in my &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/145302675/CLITORAL_STIMULATION_DURING_PENILE_VAGINAL_INTERCOURSE_A_PHENOMENOLOGICAL_STUDY_OF_FEMALE_AND_MALE_EXPERIENCES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; research … and there were no two people who liked the exact same thing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how does that get communicated to sex partners? I think if it was spoken about more, represented more, and normalized, the pleasure that would be an outcome of that would be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                                            &lt;p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;There’s sweet news for all of us craving holiday treats while trying to cut back on sugar. A new landmark study confirms what doctors and nutritionists have long advised: sugar-free sweeteners like sucralose, the zero-calorie sugar substitute in Splenda®, can positively help us manage, and improve, our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a doctor with a strong family history of diabetes, I was glad to read this research result in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01381-z" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01381-z" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In a randomized clinical trial versus sugar, non-sugar sweeteners, including sucralose, were found to help patients lose weight and to achieve improvement in gut bacteria that can support healthy digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RC-AD RC-AD-BOX-MIDDLE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SWEET study, as it’s called, is one of the most comprehensive long-term investigations of sweeteners to date, and it reinforces and advances decades of similar findings. The study tracked adults and children who were overweight or obese, divided into two groups: in one group, sugar could be part of their diet; in the other group, only non-sugar sweeteners, including sucralose, were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over course of the study, which lasted more than a year, both groups were followed for weight loss, and their gut bacteria were very carefully studied for the effects of sugar versus non-sugar sweeteners. The results were clear and encouraging: those who swapped sugar for non-sugar sweeteners, including sucralose, not only kept more weight off than those who stuck with sugar, but their gut microbiomes—the role of which is becoming ever better defined as important to overall health—also improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings help correct years of confusion about the impacts of sucralose in particular. For more than a decade, many consumers have been told that Splenda®, one of the most widely used low-calorie sweeteners in the world, might harm the gut microbiome. That assertion was based on a 2008 study done in rats—not humans--that claimed sucralose disrupted gut bacteria. The journal that published the study has since issued an official “expression of concern” over possible data manipulation and has advised readers to interpret the information “with due caution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SWEET study has proven, using real science to debunk sensationalized and unsupported claims, that replacing sugar with non-sugar sweeteners, including sucralose, can actually be beneficial to our gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big win in just about every way you can imagine. For those of us who are watching our weight and our calories every day, being able to enjoy sweet treats without sugar really enhances our quality of life. For doctors like me who care for patients with diabetes, being able to recommend sugar-free sweeteners like Splenda®’s sucralose gives us a powerful tool to help prevent serious complications. Ever since Splenda® first became available in the U.S. in 1998, it’s been my first choice for myself and my first recommendation for my patients, and it’s no surprise that worldwide, the popularity of foods and beverages sweetened with sucralose has &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938416301184?via%3Dihub" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938416301184?via%3Dihub" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="1"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for our country, with 90 million Americans suffering from obesity and all the illnesses it causes—like diabetes, affecting 38 million of us—making it easier to cut sugar out of our diets is a huge win for both the quality and cost of our health care. With the new focus on making America healthy again, or &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf" title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2"&gt;MAHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, receiving broad support, sugar-free alternatives like sucralose can be embraced with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisely, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins are urging us to reduce sugar consumption; doctors and public health officials across the political spectrum echo this recommendation. Non-sugar sweeteners like sucralose let us do that without giving up the flavors that make life more enjoyable—and that can transform a healthy goal into a life-enhancing, lifetime habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the SWEET study, we have robust scientific proof that non-sugar sweeteners, including Splenda®’s sucralose, can be safe, effective tools for all of us who want to optimize our health and still enjoy the foods and beverages that make life sweet indeed. This is happy holiday news worth sharing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highly contagious virus previously linked to mass whale strandings has been identified for the first time in Arctic cetaceans, using airborne breath samples collected by drones. The findings introduce a new method for monitoring marine mammal disease in remote, climate-sensitive ecosystems, and raise concerns about the spread of pathogens in rapidly warming ocean environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus, &lt;strong&gt;cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV)&lt;/strong&gt;, was detected in the exhaled breath, or “blow” of wild humpback, sperm, and fin whales. Scientists used drones fitted with sterile Petri dishes to capture droplets as the animals surfaced to breathe. These samples confirmed the presence of CeMV in waters north of the Arctic Circle, a region where its circulation had not previously been documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CeMV is known for causing acute respiratory, immune and neurological damage in whales, dolphins and porpoises. First identified in 1987 along the US Atlantic coast, it has since been linked to mass mortality events globally. The emergence of the virus in Arctic whale populations suggests a shift in its geographic distribution, potentially influenced by climate change and species migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was led by Nord University in Norway and involved collaboration with King’s College London, the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, the University of Iceland and&lt;strong&gt; BIOS-CV&lt;/strong&gt; in Cape Verde. It represents the first confirmed use of drone-based sampling to detect a marine mammal virus in this region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Drone-Based Surveillance Confirms Virus in Whale Populations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project spanned nine years, from 2016 to 2025, and involved drone sampling across the North-East Atlantic, including coastal regions of Norway, Iceland and Cape Verde. Researchers captured exhaled droplets from whales during surfacing events and analysed them for viral markers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CeMV was confirmed in multiple individuals, including humpback whales in northern Norway, a sperm whale exhibiting signs of poor condition, and a pilot whale found stranded. In one case, additional tissue sampling was conducted to corroborate results. All findings were verified through laboratory diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drone whale sampling offered a minimally invasive solution for studying disease in free-ranging marine mammals. Unlike traditional biopsy or capture methods, drones allowed researchers to collect samples without direct contact or disruption. This approach is particularly suited to environments where logistics, weather and conservation ethics limit the feasibility of conventional wildlife surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also screened for other pathogens. Herpesviruses were identified in humpbacks across Norway, Iceland, and Cape Verde. However, no traces of avian influenza virus or &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, both associated with previous cetacean die-offs, were found in the collected samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Marine Mammal Disease in a Changing Arctic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of cetacean morbillivirus in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/buried-under-arctic-ice-this-lifeform-is-thriving-scientists-say-it-wasnt-supposed-to-exist-there/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="93121" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arctic waters &lt;/a&gt;adds to growing evidence that warming seas are reshaping the distribution of marine species and the diseases that affect them. As ocean temperatures rise, migratory and resident populations are overlapping in new ways, creating opportunities for viral transmission that were previously unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that seasonal feeding aggregations, where whales, seabirds and humans converge in dense biological activity, may facilitate the spread of CeMV. These gatherings are increasingly common in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions, where shifting prey patterns draw large numbers of marine species into shared feeding zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The detection of CeMV in multiple locations across a wide geographic range suggests that the virus is now established in certain Arctic populations. The findings support earlier concerns raised by virologists and marine ecologists about the vulnerability of high-latitude ecosystems to emerging infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed literature has documented similar patterns elsewhere. A 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Veterinary Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; linked climate variability with increased exposure to morbilliviruses in marine mammals. The virus’s ability to jump between species and persist in migratory corridors heightens its risk profile, particularly in polar ecosystems undergoing rapid environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long-Term Monitoring and Implications for Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to confirming viral presence, the research offers a framework for ongoing disease surveillance using low-cost, commercially available drones. Breath sampling requires less infrastructure than ship-based biopsy collection or necropsy and can be deployed in areas with minimal human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Project lead Helena Costa of Nord University stated in the published paper that future research will focus on continuing drone-based surveillance to better understand how multiple environmental stressors are influencing whale health over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommend expanding monitoring efforts to additional migratory routes, particularly those connecting the Arctic with lower latitudes. Broader genomic analysis of CeMV strains may also be needed to determine whether the virus has evolved in response to new host species or environmental pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — A dog in Chicago has tested positive for rabies, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been at least 61 years since the last reported case of a rabid dog in Cook County. The last time the state reported a rabid dog was in 1994, according to a health department press release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog was less than a year old and had been adopted by a Chicago home from a local rescue, which had received the puppies from a Florida rescue in May, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog — which showed behavioral issues such as “growling, snapping, increased barking and anxiety” — bit a person Dec. 11, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The dog’s behavior worsened Dec. 16, and it was euthanized two days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two tests on Friday confirmed the dog was positive for rabies, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health department officials are investigating the strain and source of rabies in the dog, which was vaccinated for rabies in June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible the dog was exposed to rabies before it had been vaccinated, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are “evaluating any people in contact with the dog” to determine if they need treatment, and Cook County animal control officials are in touch with owners of littermates to the rabid dog, according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee on its own doesn’t typically have a significant impact on your blood sugar levels. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding sweeteners and flavored creamers, among other factors, can increase your blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut back on sweeteners, pair coffee with meals and stay active to limit glucose spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood sugar naturally fluctuates throughout the day. “Levels rise after meals for everyone because carbohydrates break down into glucose,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vnutritionandwellness.com/author/kathleen-benson/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kathleen Benson, CSSD, CPT, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/insulin-resistance-symptoms-8611181" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin resistance or diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these increases may be higher and last longer because the body doesn’t respond to insulin as efficiently or doesn’t produce enough of it, Benson explains.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For most people, blood sugar levels are lowest in the morning after fasting overnight and rise after meals as your body digests and absorbs carbohydrates,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of us reach for a cup (or two) of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coffee in the morning&lt;/a&gt;, you may wonder whether your daily brew is affecting your blood sugar levels at the start of each day. Our experts take a deep dive into how your morning java may affect your blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-coffee-affects-your-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Coffee Affects Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Coffee on its own typically doesn’t cause a significant rise in blood sugar itself,” Manaker says. It’s the other add-ons, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugary syrups and certain sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, that can lead to a temporary spike in blood glucose, Manaker notes. “If you’re drinking coffee &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a meal, the impact on blood sugar is likely minimal, especially if the meal includes protein and healthy fats.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those who are caffeine-sensitive and don’t have diabetes may also see a more dramatic increase in blood sugar compared to others. “Coffee can raise blood sugar for some people because caffeine can trigger hormones that tell the liver to release extra glucose,” Benson says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This doesn’t happen to everyone, and the effect depends on how sensitive someone is to caffeine and how much they drink.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-factors-that-can-affect-how-coffee-impacts-your-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4 Factors That Can Affect How Coffee Impacts Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. The Type of Sweetener You Use &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study suggests that drinking a few cups of black coffee daily is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that isn’t the case when &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; or even artificial sweeteners are swirled in. “Added sugars—including table sugar, flavored syrups, honey and agave—can raise blood sugar because they’re quickly absorbed by the body,” Benson says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, if you do prefer something a little sweet in your morning cup of joe, using certain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar-free sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; is still a better option, the experts say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sugar alcohols, like in ‘skinny’ syrups, may cause a smaller rise in blood sugar, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290579/is-stevia-safe/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonnutritive sweeteners like stevia&lt;/a&gt; don’t raise blood sugar at all,” Benson says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To lessen the impact, Benson offers a few suggestions: gradually reduce added sugar, switch to half-syrup or use stevia to keep sweetness without the spike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. The Type of Creamer You Add &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many types of creamers out there—and each can have a different impact on your blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sweetened creamers, especially flavored ones, often contain added sugars that raise blood sugar,” Benson says. “Even half-and-half or whole-milk creamers can raise blood sugar slightly in larger amounts due to natural lactose.” (Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar in dairy milk.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-coffee-creamer-11827312" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nondairy creamers&lt;/a&gt; lack lactose, some make up for it with added sugars, Manaker says, which can lead to temporary spikes in blood sugar, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your move: Stick to 1 to 2 tablespoons of unsweetened creamers, like heavy cream, half-and-half or unsweetened plant-based milk, Benson says. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Coffee on an Empty Stomach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking caffeine on an empty stomach can cause sharper blood sugar rises because there’s no protein, fat or fiber to buffer the stress-hormone response,” Benson says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s break this down: Caffeine activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, increasing the release of stress hormones like cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones signal the liver to release stored glucose, which can lead to a rapid spike in blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re sipping coffee solo, you might miss out on the blood sugar–stabilizing benefits of protein,” Manaker says. “Pairing your coffee with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291961/10-high-protein-snacks-that-keep-you-feeling-full-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich snack or meal&lt;/a&gt; can help keep your blood sugar more stable.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consider drinking your morning java alongside two scrambled eggs, one serving of Greek yogurt, or with a small bowl of cottage cheese and fruit, Benson says. Including protein at meals is often recommended to help stabilize post-meal glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Your Sensitivity to Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some people are more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, which can temporarily raise stress hormones like cortisol and lead to higher blood sugar levels,” Manaker says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If this sounds like you, try limiting your coffee intake or switching to decaf.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who doesn’t typically sleep well or works a high-stress job, you may already have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;elevated cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, Benson notes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Adding caffeine on top can exaggerate the blood-glucose rise,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ease the impact by adopting sleep-hygiene strategies, drinking plenty of water and avoiding caffeine when you’re already stressed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also been associated with higher long-term diabetes risk,” Benson says.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Most people see better blood sugar stability when they keep coffee as part of a balanced morning routine, not a replacement for breakfast.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; TL;DR: If you’re worried about your blood sugar levels, you don’t need to stop enjoying your morning cup of coffee—many people look&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;forward to that part of their day. Just keep in mind the factors that might adversely affect your glucose levels when you drink your cup of joe. If you have diabetes and you’re monitoring your blood glucose levels throughout the day, or you tend to feel jittery after your cup of java, you can ease any temporary blood sugar spikes by enjoying breakfast with your cup of coffee and staying active.

From collagen treatments and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vitamin-c-serums" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C serums&lt;/a&gt; to bakuchiol and retinol, the beauty industry continues to expand its arsenal for addressing early signs of aging. The latest ingredient gaining real momentum? Copper peptides, rapidly emerging as a leading age-defying active. Below, a clear look at their origins, how they work, and why they’ve become a coveted addition to modern routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are copper peptides?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-peptide-skincare" target="_blank"&gt;Peptides&lt;/a&gt;, which the body naturally produces, are chains of amino acids—the fundamental building blocks of proteins. Their job is essential: like structural “bricks,” they help form proteins such as collagen and elastin, both &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-peptide-serums" target="_blank"&gt;crucial for maintaining the skin’s texture&lt;/a&gt;, density, and elasticity. Among the estimated billions of peptides that exist, copper peptide GHK-Cu has inspired particular excitement within cosmetic science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Copper peptides are a type of carrier peptide made up of copper bound to amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins,” explains board-certified dermatologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"}' href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Marisa Garshick&lt;/a&gt;. “Copper peptides are found naturally in the body, but their levels decline with age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of copper peptides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because copper peptides occur naturally in the body, they offer a wide array of benefits &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/peptides-for-skin" target="_blank"&gt;when applied topically&lt;/a&gt;. First identified in 1973 by Dr. Loren Pickart, copper peptide GHK-Cu stands out for its remarkable anti-aging capacity. It is known to stimulate collagen synthesis, helping maintain the skin’s firmness and resilience while slowing visible aging. A 1998 study from the Reims Faculty of Medicine found that collagen production increased by 70% after one month of applying this peptide—compared with a 40% increase from &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-tretinoin" target="_blank"&gt;tretinoin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4508379/" target="_blank"&gt;Subsequent studies&lt;/a&gt; have further illustrated its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In skincare, copper peptides help signal the skin to support collagen and elastin production, which can improve firmness, texture, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Garshick. “They also have antioxidant properties, help support wound healing, and promote the production of glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, which enhances hydration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use copper peptides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating products with copper peptides into your skincare routine is simple: begin with applications every other day to allow the skin to adjust, then increase frequency as your skin’s tolerance and visible results guide you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as which formulations are best, Garshick recommends looking for products that pair copper peptides with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/moisturizing-face-balms" target="_blank"&gt;barrier-supporting and hydrating ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, “as this helps maximize both tolerability and results.” She particularly likes the &lt;a

            &lt;p&gt;Marchione says he has always taken an unconventional, even contrarian approach, exploring beyond what mainstream medicine recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teen, he was an early adopter of fitness wearables like the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/oura-ring-4-review" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Oura ring&lt;/a&gt;, and got into blue-light-blocking glasses and mouth taping — trends that, despite some mixed evidence, have become incredibly popular in wellness today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a big fan of peptide injections, such as the "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/peptide-shots-popular-for-anti-aging-muscle-building-weight-loss-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Wolverine shot&lt;/a&gt;," a compound called BPC-157. It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c20fd96d-9bcd-4f4a-9535-a9c11d8b7237" data-toc-id="c20fd96d-9bcd-4f4a-9535-a9c11d8b7237"&gt;Marchione's smoothie recipe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-more-fiber-without-feeling-gassy-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glucose-goddess-simple-diet-swaps-balance-blood-sugar-more-energy-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marchione's full "smoothie stack," which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blueberries: &lt;/strong&gt;full of fiber and compounds called flavonoids that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-memory-supplement-plant-protein-berries-scientist-2024-2" rel=""&gt;promote healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Marchione opts for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wild blueberries (frozen for convenience), which are smaller, darker in color, and denser in nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whey protein: &lt;/strong&gt;widely available and fast-digesting, whey is often considered the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-whey-protein-powder" rel=""&gt;gold standard of protein powders&lt;/a&gt;. Marchione uses whey from goat milk, which can be easier to digest and higher in minerals like magnesium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collagen: &lt;/strong&gt;a type of protein that makes up connective tissue and supports healthy joints, skin, and hair. It's often sold as a supplement powder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colostrum: &lt;/strong&gt;a supplement from the milk of cows that have just given birth, so it's especially full of protein, vitamins, and antibodies. It's sold as a supplement powder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taurine: &lt;/strong&gt;an amino acid that supports healthy energy and metabolism, has been linked to potential antiaging benefits through research. It's available as a supplement in powder form or pills, and is often added to energy drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder: &lt;/strong&gt;an antioxidant-rich compound that's a less processed version of the beans that make chocolate — all the benefits, without the added fat and sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acai: &lt;/strong&gt;a rainforest berry full of fiber and even more antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-Glutamine: &lt;/strong&gt;an amino acid that supports digestion and the immune system. It's sold as a supplement in powder and pill form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-protein-maximize-muscle-gains-2022-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;total daily protein&lt;/a&gt; intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once," he wrote on his website.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqa1s800ed28p40supf0b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As &lt;a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/12/aaa-year-end-holiday-travel-forecast/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; hit the road or take to the skies for the holidays, another seasonal traveler is picking up speed: influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000a3b6pp6bzu47u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity is already rising across the country. In the week ending December 13, roughly 4% of visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses, and nearly 10,000 patients were hospitalized with influenza, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday. So far, three children already have died from flu-related causes this flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000b3b6pkmdix4zr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those numbers mean the virus may be closer to home than many families realize. Holiday gatherings could include someone just recovering from the flu, or someone beginning to feel sick. Should they still show up to open presents on Christmas morning? How long should a visit be postponed before heading to grandma’s to bake cookies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000c3b6ptc6ytuut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As flu cases climb, here are the flu-related rules families should know this holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000e3b6p2nrpbckz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several over-the-counter flu tests available in the United States, and they can be taken at home as a nasal swab, similar to Covid-19 tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000f3b6pz09khqpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors recommend taking a test as soon as you experience symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000g3b6pobmnbf81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Particularly if you’re a person in a high-risk group,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000h3b6p8ne8t389@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those persons are people who are age 65 and older, anyone who has a chronic underlying medical condition, if you’re immune compromised, if you’re a pregnant person and very young children,” he said. “Those are all people who are in high-risk, and once they have symptoms, that’s the time to get tested, because we would have antivirals available to help keep you out of the hospital.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqa4t400003b6pn9ba9c8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu symptoms usually start suddenly with fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, Dr. Pamela Lindor, a pediatrician at Bluebird Kids Health in Jacksonville, Florida, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvemf7002b3b6pvfqqgaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While you should quickly start treatment and avoid exposing others when you test positive for flu, “if the over the counter test is negative but your symptoms are severe, consider getting a more accurate test from your doctor or urgent care center,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000i3b6pq7ud6plx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing is key because once it is determined which respiratory illness you have, you can then receive appropriate treatment, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000j3b6pthof7fd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is not the only illness we’re concerned about. Maybe you have Covid, and if you have Covid, we have another medication that could help keep you out of the hospital,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000l3b6pa2a1im44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;antiviral drugs&lt;/a&gt;, such as Tamiflu or Xofluza, are prescription medications, and they work best when started early, ideally within two days after flu symptoms begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000m3b6pipsesvhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the flu, if you are ill, the sooner you begin the antiviral, the more effective it is,” Schaffner said. “There is the 48-hour rule. That is, for it to be maximally effective, you have to initiate treatment within the first 48 hours after you get symptoms. But even after 48 hours – and this is especially true for high-risk people – you can still have some modulating effect of the antivirals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000o3b6pkszo022t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As soon as someone starts to show symptoms, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people to not spread the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000p3b6ppam78qp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re capable of transmitting the influenza virus the day before you get symptoms,” Schaffner said. “But nonetheless, wear a mask and avoid other people in your family as much as possible until your symptoms start to abate and you’ve had no fever for 24 hours without using Tylenol.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000q3b6phrc1drjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, people can return to their normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, they have not had a fever without using fever-reduction medication, and their overall symptoms are improving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvgd8d002m3b6pa1k022el@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will usually be at least 4-5 days,” Lindor said. “Flu is most contagious starting the day before symptoms develop and continuing for about one week.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000s3b6pli9n7gb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people who have symptoms or fever might be tempted to still visit family or open Christmas gifts with loved ones, as long as they wear a mask, but Schaffner still warned against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000t3b6py0zaykoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve developed symptoms, I think you’ve got to stay home,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000u3b6ptcip4j16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you say, ‘Well, I have these symptoms, but I’ll wear a mask.’ Yes, that will reduce the chance of spreading but not reduce it to zero. And guess what? It’s very hard to eat and drink with a mask on,” he said. “So, you will indeed be exposing people. And when you get to family members, even when you wear that mask, they’ll be hugging and kissing. These are very close circumstances, so you’ve got to restrain yourself and separate yourself, otherwise you are very much in danger of becoming a dreaded spreader.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvoi3q002z3b6pj0bxvehi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While someone with flu should take precautions to isolate themselves and not expose others, there are important steps their household members also can take to reduce their risk of getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvqa3y003a3b6p70vnu93r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good handwashing is very important to prevent spread,” Lindor said. “Common surfaces in the house should be disinfected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000w3b6pp4ww10no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to people who have been exposed to someone with flu, but they are not yet showing signs or symptoms themselves, especially if that person is in a high-risk group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvogqs002x3b6pyq50jf8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tamiflu can be prescribed to people who have been exposed to the flu, and is usually taken for 7-10 days to prevent infection,” Lindor said. “Xofluza can also be used prophylactically, and only one dose is needed, for adults and children 5 or older.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000x3b6pf9i36iiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, a 22-year-old college student may travel home for Christmas to visit their grandfather. The next day, after they have already visited their grandfather, they test positive for the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000y3b6plfl51ksj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their grandfather is obviously in a high-risk group. Should the grandfather take Tamiflu for five days? That’s not a bad idea,” Schaffner said. “In that circumstance, it could very well avert the influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300103b6p43zxhtdl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important to stay in contact with your doctor once you test positive for flu and experience worsening symptoms, especially if you are in a high-risk group, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300113b6pvdkxbse9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And with your doctor, “have those discussions about when it is that you need to go to the hospital,” he said. “But difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, really feeling terrible, temperatures of 103 or higher – all of those things are indicators that you really need medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvtdmi003g3b6po36s9upi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some other “warning signs” that may require urgent medical attention include “dehydration, chest pain, lethargy, mental status changes, seizures or severe weakness,” Lindor said. “Confusion, behavior changes, or high persistent fever for over 3 days also warrant urgent medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300133b6pg6wainq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is still time to receive your seasonal flu shot if you haven’t already.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300143b6p5lzbcy2v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For all those people out there who are still well, if you haven’t been vaccinated, please get the vaccine. Don’t linger,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300153b6plmkiy2u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s a holiday present to you and to everyone else around you,” he said. “There’s more than one kind of influenza virus out there, and the vaccine helps prevent serious disease due to three different types of influenza virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvueqr003o3b6p46j2ysw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lindor said that overall, the best way to avoid having the flu disrupt family gatherings during the holidays is “for all family members to get their flu vaccine early in the flu season each year.”

&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genes &amp;amp; Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; unpacks the molecular processes that allow mouse embryonic stem cells to stay pluripotent while in suspended animation. By identifying the genetic switches that hold development in check, scientists are uncovering how cells survive deep metabolic stress without losing their identity, a discovery that could reshape how we understand diseases like cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embryonic diapause is observed across more than 100 mammalian species, from rodents to marine mammals. After fertilization, the embryo stops developing at the blastocyst stage, a compact cluster of cells that would normally continue growing. In seals, for instance, this pause gives females the chance to wait for optimal seasonal and nutritional conditions before continuing gestation. Although humans don’t experience this process, the cellular mechanisms behind diapause may be present in many systems, including long-lived immune cells and dormant tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Universal Brake on Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Rockefeller University research team led by &lt;a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/979-alexander-tarakhovsky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alexander Tarakhovsky&lt;/a&gt;, the diapause state can be triggered in embryonic stem cells by multiple stressors, such as nutrient limitation or a lack of growth signals. Regardless of the trigger, cells responded by activating the same molecular program—one that represses the MAP kinase pathway, a critical driver of cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, researchers used the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 and a BET protein inhibitor called I-BET151 to mimic conditions of metabolic and transcriptional stress. Both treatments induced a diapause-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells. The cells stopped proliferating, reduced their metabolism, and entered a dormant phase, yet retained the ability to become any cell type. Crucially, they remained in this state even when exposed to signals that would normally prompt differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key to this suspended animation was a set of genes known as negative regulators of MAP kinase (NRMAPK), which include &lt;em&gt;Dusp4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dusp6&lt;/em&gt;, and members of the &lt;em&gt;Sprouty&lt;/em&gt; family. These genes act as natural brakes, keeping the MAP kinase pathway in check and thereby preserving the cells’ pluripotency. According to the study, suppressing these brake genes caused the dormant cells to lose their undifferentiated state, underscoring their essential role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capicua, the Molecular Gatekeeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper into the mechanism, the researchers discovered that a protein called &lt;strong&gt;Capicua &lt;/strong&gt;(CIC) plays a central role in regulating these brake genes. In unstressed cells, CIC binds to the promoters of NRMAPK genes, keeping them silent. When stressors like mTOR or BET inhibition are introduced, CIC is displaced from the DNA, allowing the brake genes to activate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This displacement is selective. CIC was removed specifically from the promoters of the MAP kinase inhibitors, but remained bound to unrelated gene regions, indicating a targeted response. As explained in &lt;a href="https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2025/12/11/gad.353143.125.full.pdf+html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genes &amp;amp; Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this shift leads to a rapid and reversible repression of differentiation pathways. Once the stress is lifted, CIC rebinds and the cells exit diapause, ready to resume development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team also showed that this mechanism is conserved across various stress-induced diapause-like states. For example, cells rendered dormant by &lt;strong&gt;Myc deficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, a condition known to suppress transcriptional activity, also showed upregulation of NRMAPK genes and reduction in MAP kinase activity. This convergence of distinct stress signals on a shared molecular outcome suggests a robust, self-organizing network response rather than a single regulatory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pluripotency Preserved Through Stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable aspects of this study is the observation that diapause-like embryonic stem cells maintain full pluripotency. Despite severe metabolic and transcriptional downregulation, these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/virtual-cells-and-the-ai-revolution/" data-type="post" data-id="71531"&gt;cells &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;did not lose their ability to form all tissue types. In tests, even when exposed to strong differentiation signals like FGF4 or retinoic acid, diapause cells resisted commitment and remained in an undifferentiated state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I-BET-resistant embryonic stem cells (&lt;strong&gt;I-BETR&lt;/strong&gt;) continued expressing core pluripotency markers like &lt;em&gt;Sox2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stat3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lifr&lt;/em&gt;, while genes promoting differentiation, such as &lt;em&gt;Gata6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Neurod1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Otx2&lt;/em&gt;, were sharply repressed. Once the BET inhibitor was removed, the cells rapidly resumed growth and could contribute to chimeric embryos. According to the authors, this confirms the reversibility and developmental potential of the diapause-like state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This preserved identity in the face of environmental adversity mirrors cellular behavior seen in other biological systems. Long-lived memory T cells, certain stem cell populations in adult tissues, and even dormant cancer cells may use similar transcriptional brakes to endure unfavorable conditions. While humans don’t undergo embryonic diapause, the molecular machinery that supports it may be a more general survival strategy embedded in our cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diapause, once viewed as a curiosity of animal reproduction, is revealing itself as a broader biological principle. The mechanisms uncovered by Tarakhovsky’s team offer a window into how cells protect themselves against collapse, pausing without losing their purpose, and possibly shedding light on how to control or exploit dormancy in disease contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now.” -Thomas Jefferson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Sam. Sam has obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. His diet consists mostly of refined grains and trans fats. He’s got cabinets full of dirt-cheap junk food and sky-high healthcare costs to address its effects. He takes home $27,000 a year, but &lt;a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20National%20Deficit&amp;amp;text=In%20FY%202025%2C%20the%20federal,referred%20to%20as%20deficit%20spending."&gt;spends&lt;/a&gt; $36,000. He’s in debt up to his jaundiced eyeballs, and he wants his niece to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypipes/2025/10/27/medicare-cant-afford-not-to-cover-ozempic/"&gt;foot the bill&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/02/ozempic-weight-loss-older-americans-boomers/677371/"&gt;weight-loss medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a real-life &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N8wxb-wwQnA?si=y0hb8idPxU48GAH6&amp;amp;t=92"&gt;niece&lt;/a&gt; of my Uncle Sam, I’m concerned about his diet. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160705120023.htm"&gt;56.2 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the daily calories consumed by US adults come from federally subsidized food commodities: corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy, and livestock. While these calorie-dense foods once made sense for a government preparing for famine or &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/total-war"&gt;total war&lt;/a&gt;, in recent decades they’ve instead helped make us &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6512298/"&gt;fatter and sicker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a top driver of healthcare costs. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379713003206"&gt;One study compared&lt;/a&gt; the health of people who eat mostly foods the federal government subsidizes to those who eat fewer. Those who follow the revealed preferences of what the government subsidizes (rather than the diet it consciously &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/what-is-myplate"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt;) are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379713003206"&gt;almost 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; more likely to be obese and face significant diet-related health issues. Those with the highest consumption of federally subsidized foods also have significantly higher rates of belly fat, abnormal cholesterol, high levels of blood sugar, and more markers of chronic inflammation. All these are increasing contributors to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death"&gt;most common causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The negative impact of subsidized crop consumption on health — while it can’t be called causal — persists even after controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic factors. But life does not control for those factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Great Grain Giveaway&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The federal government recommends one diet to Americans, and subsidizes another. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the USDA and HHS promote eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein, and moderate dairy, while limiting saturated fats, sugars, salt, and refined grains. According to data compiled for &lt;a href="https://meatonomics.com/"&gt;Meatonomics&lt;/a&gt;, American agribusiness receives about $38 billion annually in federal funding, with only 0.4 percent ($17 million) going to fruits and vegetables. Just three percent of cropland is devoted to fruits and vegetables, despite &lt;a href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/"&gt;USDA guidelines&lt;/a&gt;’ insistence that they should cover half of your dinner plate. Just 10 percent of Americans consume the recommended amount of fresh produce, and the poor consume the least. (Fruit and vegetable producers’ exclusion from the federal direct payments program provides a valuable example of a food industry thriving without &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/fairness-why-fruits-vegetables-are-excluded-from-farm-subsidies/#:~:text=A%20perhaps%20unintended%20consequence%20of%20excluding%20themselves,Alli%20Condra%20is%20pursuing%20her%20LL.%20M."&gt;significant subsidies&lt;/a&gt;. They do, however, rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/feeding-america-how-immigrants-sustain-us-agriculture#:~:text=Agricultural%20Labor%20Shortages%20in%20the%20US,-During%20most%20of&amp;amp;text=%5B5%5D%20At%20the%20same%20time,keeping%20the%20agricultural%20sector%20working."&gt;migrant labor&lt;/a&gt; to lower costs.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the US spends tens of billions annually to subsidize seven major commodities. The three largest farm subsidy programs contribute 70 percent of funds to producers of just three crops — corn, soybeans, and wheat. Approximately 30-40 percent of US corn, over half of soybeans, and nearly all sorghum feed livestock, heavily discounting high-fat, &lt;a href="https://extension.umn.edu/pasture-based-dairy/grass-fed-cows-produce-healthier-milk"&gt;lower-nutrition&lt;/a&gt; meat and dairy (especially compared to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8728510/#:~:text=Beef%20from%20grass%2Dfed%20contains,same%20amount%20of%20grain%2Dfed."&gt;grass-fed options&lt;/a&gt;). The prevalence of grain-fed livestock generates demand for commodities used to feed them, completing the circle. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subsidies also contribute to our consumption of refined grains, sugary drinks, and processed foods. About five percent of corn becomes artificially cheap high-fructose corn syrup (which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/29/1145952357/throughline-how-one-company-contributed-greatly-to-americas-sweet-tooth"&gt;allows it to compete&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/06/high-fructose-corn-syrup-and-the-sugar-quota.html"&gt;tariffed natural sugars&lt;/a&gt;), and half of soybeans are processed into oils, which also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4511588/#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,fat%20from%20coconut%20oil%20in"&gt;contribute to obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Uncle Sam is sick because he eats the food the government makes artificially more affordable. Those foods are poorer in quality and more harmful to health than their unsubsidized alternatives. We are paying to make ourselves sicker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Diet-Related Health Issues Fuel Healthcare Costs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, the FDA has known that trans fats and refined grains harm health, damage metabolism, and cause disease. Diet-related illnesses like obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure are increasing, while heart disease remains the leading cause of death. These epidemics are intertwined at the artery level, and both contribute hugely to rising US health care costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an economic order awash with subsidies and regulation, agricultural policy is health policy. Government subsidies for agricultural products have shaped the current American nutritional environment, and they are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3489137/"&gt;exacerbating&lt;/a&gt; obesity trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An article in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2813%2900320-6/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt; confirms: “Current agricultural policy remains largely uninformed by public health discourse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johns Hopkins physician (and current &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/martin-makary"&gt;Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; of the US Food and Drug Administration) &lt;a href="https://x.com/shellenberger/status/1845171727602704388"&gt;Marty Makary called out&lt;/a&gt; the disconnect clearly. “Half of all federal spending is going to health care in its many hidden forms,” he told an interviewer in October, but Americans continue “getting sicker and sicker… Chronic diseases are on the rise. Cancers are on the rise. And we have the most medicated generation in human history.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re getting &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7216a7.htm"&gt;more medicated&lt;/a&gt; every day — and &lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/prescription-price-tag-u-s-taxpayers-cover-nearly-60-of-drug-costs/#:~:text=Prescription%20Price%20Tag:%20U.S.%20Taxpayers,of%20Drug%20Costs%20%2D%20Public%20Citizen"&gt;more of it&lt;/a&gt; is at taxpayer expense. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Better Answer Than Ozempic?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Government spending on healthcare &lt;a href="https://budget.house.gov/press-release/governments-mandatory-health-care-spending-now-exceeds-entire-discretionary-budget#:~:text=Discretionary%20funding%20now%20makes%20up,forecasted%20to%20reach%20%241.67%20trillion"&gt;now exceeds the entire discretionary budget&lt;/a&gt;. Excess weight is a significant risk for older Americans, who are also the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215400/"&gt;most likely&lt;/a&gt; to both have high healthcare costs and to rely on government health care. &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity"&gt;Forty percent of Americans over 60&lt;/a&gt; are classified as having obesity, which is a contributing or complicating factor in diseases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"&gt;that kill older Americans&lt;/a&gt;: cancers, heart disease, infection, stroke, and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late last year, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; approved the weight-loss drug Wegovy as a treatment for people at risk of heart attack or stroke. Medicare is forbidden by statute from covering prescription drugs for weight loss alone, but in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-medication-chronic-weight-management"&gt;2021 regulators approved&lt;/a&gt; Wegovy for reducing weight-related risks in patients with diabetes. Medicare &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/a-small-number-of-drugs-account-for-a-large-share-of-medicare-part-d-spending/"&gt;Part D plans spent $2.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year on related compound &lt;a href="https://www.ozempic.com/"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; to keep 500,000 patients with diabetes stable. Wegovy’s list price is around $1,300 per month, but that’s still small compared to the $&lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/wp-content/uploads/022819-Final-Budget-Impact-Analysis.pdf"&gt;1.4 trillion Americans spend&lt;/a&gt; on direct and indirect costs from obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has a certain economic logic. Instead of waiting for a patient to develop a cascade of expensive comorbidities like heart failure or diabetes, we &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4818"&gt;could consider&lt;/a&gt; asking Medicare to pay for anti-obesity meds on the front end. That wouldn’t work as well as &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intensive-lifestyle-change-it-works-and-its-more-than-diet-and-exercise-201708212529"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt;, but all our health and activity messaging over the past several years doesn’t seem to have moved that needle, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diet-farm-subsidies/foods-from-subsidized-commodities-tied-to-obesity-idUSKCN0ZL2ER"&gt;significant evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests our efforts are counterproductive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Tangled Web of Farm Subsidies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand the insanity of American agricultural and health policy, it’s hard to do better than comedian-illusionists Penn &amp;amp; Teller, who in characteristically salty style (really — you’ll want headphones and a sense of humor to watch the video) explained it this way 15 years ago: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fructose corn syrup is a dirt-cheap way to add sweetener and extend shelf life. And why is it so cheap? Because we subsidize corn farmers! Our government gives about 10 billion of our tax dollars to corn farmers every year so they can produce more corn than we need. They then sell the corn at artificially low prices. They spend our money to make corn syrup cheap, and now the same government that uses our tax money to keep soft drinks cheap wants more of our tax money to make soft drinks more expensive. Does anyone else think this is incredibly f—d up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, Penn. We do. And since that clip aired, obesity rates have worsened &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/obesity-rate-nearly-triples-united-states-over-last-50-years/"&gt;50 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and rose &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/indicators/i/C6262EC/EF93DDB"&gt;78 percent&lt;/a&gt; in children. Medical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9101934/"&gt;spending&lt;/a&gt; on the consequences of obesity &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827550#:~:text=The%20rising%20prevalence%20of%20chronic,spending%20from%20employers%20and%20workers."&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt;. Over the same period, subsidies to corn growers (which includes disaster aid and insurance) have &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/farm-sector-income-forecast#:~:text=Direct%20Government%20farm%20program%20payments%20are%20forecast%20at%20$40.5%20billion,2025%2C%20largely%20unchanged%20from%202024."&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than cut back on his terrible diet, Uncle Sam wants us to pony up for weight loss drugs — to undo what our food policy has done.&lt;/p&gt;

Over a five-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week," says Redwood. "At the end of a gradual withdrawal period (because too speedy a withdrawal can trigger even worse headaches), 33 of these 36 young people were headache-free, a truly stunning result. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine."

This is why many over-the-counter headache medications include it.

Then eat until you are no longer hungry, not till you’re full.

The child was elementary school-aged from metro Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the Colorado pediatric flu death is one of three in the country so far this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During most seasons 80 to 90% of flu-related pediatric deaths happen in kids who are not fully vaccinated against flu,” said Jason Lefevre, CDC Public Affairs Specialist, via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last respiratory season, Colorado reported three pediatric flu deaths. The most recorded in recent years was 2019-20, when four Colorado children died from flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pediatric flu deaths in Colorado in by respiratory season:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__contained wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;2019-20: 4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2020-21: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2021-22: 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2022-23: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023-24: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2024-25: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2025-26: 1, (as of Dec. 19)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Source:  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu hospitalizations are rising sharply in Colorado — 334 people are currently hospitalized with influenza, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;online viral respiratory diseases report&lt;/a&gt;. That’s 3.5 times the number Colorado recorded this same week last year; the last time flu hospitalizations were this high was late February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best protection, doctors urge Coloradans to get vaccinated, but so far not that many are, though the numbers increase every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six percent of Coloradans, about 2% less than this time last year, have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu immunization&lt;/a&gt; this season, according to the dashboard. A little higher percentage (28%) of those 6 months to 9 years old have gotten a flu vaccine; just 19% of those 10-19 years have gotten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;John Daley/CPR NEws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents 65 and older have the highest flu vaccination rate, with 48%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of pediatric hospitalizations, defined as younger than 18, is 71, which is about six times what it was a month ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said the numbers matched what she was seeing as she worked in the hospital over Thanksgiving. “It was inundated with children with influenza,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pediatric clinics in Colorado have been busy too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're seeing tons of influenza A right now,” said Dr. Shen Nagel, a pediatrician with Wheat Ridge clinic Pediatrics West. “It was an early start to the season and has just kept increasing thus far,” which he said is pretty consistent with what was seen in the southern hemisphere, which had a severe season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the high numbers to start, the clinic is also seeing an increase in hospitalizations amongst its patients, especially infants and toddlers, as well as complications like pneumonias, even in older kids.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more severe illnesses and complications tend to be occurring in unimmunized kids. And with the holiday season, I'd expect even more in the next month,” Nagel said. “So it's still reasonable to get a flu shot even though we're fully into flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Ned Calonge, underscored that message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The flu vaccine remains the single most effective tool we have to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death. Because we are seeing this early surge in cases, now is the ideal time to get protected before the peak of the season,” said Calonge, via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He strongly encourages Coloradans to stay current on other respiratory immunizations. “You can safely receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same appointment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html#:~:text=on%20FluView%20Interactive.-,Key%20Points,by%20CDC%20in%20August%202025."&gt;national map&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed Colorado in dark red, one of a few states with the highest flu activity, categorized as very high, along with Louisiana, New York and New Jersey. In New York City, the nation’s largest, the activity is also classified as very high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions with the state’s biggest population centers, in the Denver metro area and El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, along with the Eastern Plains, were seeing the highest rates of flu, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cases are popping up around the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mesa County, for example, hospitalizations related to the flu are up 50% compared to a year ago. Kathleen Satterfield, epidemiologist supervisor at Mesa County Public Health, said her office has recorded 18 hospitalizations since October compared to 12 for the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have also seen and investigated six outbreaks since Dec. 9 of influenza,” Satterfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers put Mesa County at 11 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, higher than the current state average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Easier than ever to detect, vaccinate for flu at home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it's worth knowing that there are now at-home rapid flu tests, similar to COVID-19 tests, as well as a nasal spray vaccine one can self-administer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said some of the rapid tests come just as individual flu tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;John Daley/CPR News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption"&gt;An at-home test, just like the COVID-19 tests, can tell a person if they are infected with Influenza type A or B. This test also tests for COVID-19. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of them come combined with COVID testing as well. And they do a similar thing,” she said. “So you have a swab, you put it in your nose and then you can get your test result within 15 to 20 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said you can buy it at a pharmacy, grocery store or online, and a number of the tests are also covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the nasal spray flu vaccine, sold under the brand name &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/ordering-using-at-home"&gt;FluMist&lt;/a&gt;, has actually been around for a number of years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New this season, Rao said, people can self-administer it from the comfort of their living room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order it from a website, which asks screening questions to make sure you're eligible and check if your insurance will cover it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So then you can just use the spray yourself,” Rao said. “And then if you're a parent or a caregiver, you can also administer it for your kids as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said it's considered as effective as a regular shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Hesse contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:02:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5mYW4zS0w2NlFMYWxzenYwT1FMY0M2N1IzcU9GaUV4UkJHVGw0OFJFejhLMDhiaDUyZ2IzSEdjanVqamJfTGo0elpMSWEtQTFUbU5pUFhuSmlRTDRkSUc5QW1fZDF6cHZwOFgzMjQ2TllDby1PQ1dqeS1FMFV1RlE</guid></item><item><title>现在是修剪蓝莓灌木以获得更好收获的最佳时机-如何正确处理-云杉</title><link>https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-prune-blueberry-bushes-11866508</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="sc-page_1-0" class="comp sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="138" data-sc-ad-label-height="11" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="5" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1, 1, 1250, 1, 1, 1, 1]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-callout--summary lifestyle-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-summary lifestyle-sc-block-callout--border" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prune blueberry bushes annually between December and March during their dormant period. This task should be done after the shrub has shed its leaves and before its flower buds open. Pruning months vary depending on your climate and the blueberry bush variety.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How you prune blueberry bushes depends on the age of the shrub. Below are instructions for each stage of growth.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pruning your blueberry bush's shoots at planting and in year one is more severe to promote root development during establishment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inadequate pruning during this time will result in stunted growth and poor fruit yields in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pruning-rule-of-thirds-for-shrubs-3269526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;1/3 rule for pruning shrubs&lt;/a&gt; and cut back each cane by about 1/3 to 1/2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove all flower buds to conserve energy for root growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove branches that form on the top of vigorous shoots growing in the crown of the bush (these are called whips).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For year two, if the plant is still relatively small, repeat steps 1 to 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the canes reach 3 feet tall, leave some flower buds on the canes. Limit the buds to a maximum of 30. You don’t want the crop to be too heavy, or it could affect ongoing growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s all about encouraging healthy development and a uniform growth habit for your blueberry bush during years 3 to 5.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Remove lateral shoots (growing horizontally from year-old wood) that are low to the ground, broken, diseased, or weak. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove poor-quality lateral shoots in the center of the bush. This ensures a good balance of vegetative and fruiting growth and better air circulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once your blueberry bush is 5 to 7 years old, continue thinning out old canes. This helps make room for strong, new canes, prevents overcrowding, and lets in more light to maximize fruit yield. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Renewal pruning involves removing old, weak, and unproductive canes to encourage strong new growth and a more impressive yield.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don’t prune too early. Fall pruning can result in premature new shoot production, which will die off during the winter cold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shaping the bush into a V shape means canes will receive better light penetration and air circulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When branches are crossing and twisting with each other, remove the weaker of the two to allow the stronger to thrive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t get carried away when pruning established blueberry bushes. If you are too severe, you’ll end up with a lot of new shoots and fewer berries for the next couple of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cut a healthy blueberry bush down, it will grow back, but keep in mind that it will take at least two years for it to produce fruit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can cut blueberry bushes to the ground, but it will be several years before the shrub will start producing berries again. You may also need to prune more vigorously for the first few years to promote the healthiest growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueberry bushes are long-lived shrubs that can bear fruit for 50 years or more when pruned prudently and offered the right conditions and care. They are also slow-growing—it typically takes them 7 to 10 years to reach their mature size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Not only does it tend to jumpstart the metabolism and increase nutrition throughout the day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.rush.edu/news/why-you-should-eat-breakfast" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Rush University System for Health&lt;/a&gt;, but it also improves cognitive function, performance, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, it's likely that they’re lowkey struggling with certain things, no matter how much they try to hide it. The seemingly small decision to skip breakfast has big consequences. It may feel like they’re too busy to wake up early or not hungry enough to eat breakfast, but in the end, it’s their well-being that’s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they’re lowkey struggling with these 11 things&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.  Time management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-12/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-in-morning-lowkey-struggling-things-time-management.png" alt="Man struggling with time management and drinking coffee" title="time management if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning they're lowkey struggling with these things" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time management is a struggle for many people, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.morningside.edu/news/mastering-time-management-consistency-and-study-habits-in-academics" rel="nofollow"&gt;setting priorities and minimizing distractions&lt;/a&gt;. For people who regularly deal with chaotic mornings and unprepared rituals, distractions may be their only way to get through the day without falling victim to stress and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they didn’t get enough sleep, chances are skipping breakfast is their only way of reclaiming some time. They scroll from their phones in the morning and struggle to set a schedule, so by the time they need to leave the house, they’re already rushing around to get the bare necessities done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-productive-people-do-every-morning-lazy-people-hit-snooze"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Things Productive People Do Every Morning That Lazy People Hit Snooze On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

So, if someone isn’t getting enough sleep every night and consistently wakes up feeling tired, anxious, and unrested, breakfast might be one of the first things they sacrifice to snooze their alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it leads to more fatigue later in the day and consistently lower energy levels, it feels like the only thing they can do to cope with their chronic tiredness in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.  Chaotic mornings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s mothers feeling burdened by caring for their kids and prepping their households or someone struggling with a lack of sleep before going to work, if someone usually skips breakfast, they may be lowkey struggling with morning chaos.

There are so many decisions to make and things to prioritize that, when it comes to actually doing them, especially amid the morning pressure, nothing gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of struggle may also worsen mental clarity and energy, leading to avoidant behaviors that keep people from routines and habits that actually add value. From eating breakfast to going to bed early, and even disconnecting from technology, the more possible decisions a person has, the more likely they are to rely on easy, convenient choices to cope, even if they’re not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-smart-people-do-in-the-morning-normal-people-cant-stand"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Things Smart People Do In The Morning That Normal People Can't Stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

They don’t have a stable kind of trust in their bodies, and they often struggle to listen to small cues, such as fatigue or anxiety, that bubble up internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lean on avoidance and distractions to get through the day, so in the morning, when they’re working to avoid constant stress and worry, eating is the last thing on their mind. Especially if it forces them to lean into quiet time and mindfulness, prioritizing can feel entirely destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they may feel like they’re coping with avoidance. They’re focusing on things they view as obligations, while sabotaging their well-being by avoiding self-care and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s exhausting to feel like you’re surviving, rather than living.

Alongside this stress and obligation, skipping breakfast or meals may feel like the only way to show up. But if you’re not taking care of yourself, you’ll have less energy, love, and attention to offer the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let caretaking burn you out. Carve out mindful time to connect with yourself, even if it means waking up 5 minutes earlier to have breakfast and reflect on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

It can provide structure for you to manage discomfort, help to relieve stress, and even energize you when things feel chaotic. However, people who miss out on small rituals and routines, like eating breakfast, often find themselves wandering aimlessly amid these stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s work obligations or stress with parenting, people who skip breakfast sabotage their routines. They’re forced to do more heavy lifting in the afternoon when they’re feeling exhausted and often battle through a morning fog that could easily be addressed with a quick meal first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Poor work-life balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has poor work-life balance and vague boundaries, chances are their morning routines are riddled with stress and obligations.

Specifically, people who are obese are more likely to choose bigger portions of food when thinking about pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Participants in Kullmann's study were told to return to their normal diet after the five days, but one week later, further tests showed that the memory and cognitive parts of their brains were still less responsive than before beginning their higher calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="so-is-it-ok-to-indulge-at-christmas?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="so-is-it-ok-to-indulge-at-christmas?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;So is it OK to indulge at Christmas?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is well established that prolonged periods of eating – especially foods high in sugar and saturated fats – aren't good for the brain.

That’s not the path … we have to find alternative pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ladapo is a particularly extreme adherent of what is known as the “&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-promoted-freedom-choice-limiting-vaccines-food/story?id=122526364" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;medical freedom&lt;/a&gt;” movement. Its members, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), downplay the value of vaccines and emphasize that the decision to vaccinate is one of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to vaccines, medical freedom is far from free, and the movement’s supporters aren’t leveling with the public about the real cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This debate is playing out acutely in Florida, where Desantis and Ladapo are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/us/florida-school-vaccine-mandates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moving ahead&lt;/a&gt; to abolish school-entry requirements for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When contemplating changes to vaccine policy, political leaders should take into account the health and economic implications. Ladapo did not. He &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/desantis-moves-end-floridas-childhood-vaccination-mandates-doctors/story?id=126719452" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that his office had not modeled disease outcomes before announcing his new policy. His announcement came against a &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/10/08/florida-sees-sharp-rise-in-whooping-cough-infections/86551849007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;backdrop&lt;/a&gt; of an increase in whooping cough cases in Florida, which are up 81% over last year, not to mention a spate of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks nationwide. Ladapo demonstrates a lack of concern about the health of the Floridians he was hired to protect.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Amid reports that the federal government plans to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/"&gt;dramatically reduce the childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;, more states may follow Florida’s lead. Other policymakers should not be so cavalier if they are going to re-evaluate vaccine requirements. Here are four questions all policymakers, regardless of whether they are supportive of vaccines, should be prepared to answer if they are considering changing vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Will the new policy lead to decreasing immunization rates and increasing vaccine-preventable illness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date, no state has ever completely eliminated vaccine requirements, so there is no research on the effects of elimination of requirements on disease rates. Policymakers, however, can look to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814630" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on changes to exemption policies, which have shown that tightening those policies did lead to an increase in immunization uptake. They can also look to research that has shown that areas with greater numbers of exemptions to vaccine requirements do see more disease. Right now we are witnessing a growing measles &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/16/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina, a state that has seen a marked increase in vaccine requirement exemptions over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Will the policy change increase risk to vulnerable populations, including babies too young to be vaccinated and people who are immunocompromised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-promoted-freedom-choice-limiting-vaccines-food/story?id=122526364" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;promotes&lt;/a&gt; medical freedom while President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-ivf-fertility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;touts&lt;/a&gt; steps his administration is taking to encourage people to have babies. Those babies will be at risk from increasing prevalence of vaccine-preventable disease. Despite the rhetoric about vaccination being an individual choice, the reality is that there are people who rely on their community being vaccinated because they cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, in the ongoing measles &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/24/nearly-dozen-utah-babies-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Utah, 11 babies too young to be vaccinated were exposed and needed emergency medication to keep them from getting sick. If vaccination rates fall too low, parents of children with special health needs who cannot get vaccinated and are at increased risk of infectious diseases may have to consider homeschooling those children. State leaders need to consider what additional risks they are imposing on the most vulnerable members of the community by changing immunization requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What will be the burden to the taxpayer of increased costs to state and local health departments and Medicaid programs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases can be expensive, particularly for state and local health departments whose budgets are already stretched thin. According to a recent &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of relevant studies from Johns Hopkins, outbreaks can be expensive. The average cost for each case of measles is $58,951, which includes direct medical costs, treatment and quarantine protocols, and outbreak response. Meanwhile, the government &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pays&lt;/a&gt; about $26 for a dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What economic impact will the policy change have on local communities and businesses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not just taxpayer-funded health departments that bear the economic costs of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. Families and communities will also face financial burdens. For example, more than 250 residents of the county of Spartanburg, S.C., have had to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/us/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-quarantine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt; after being exposed to measles, including school children, some of whom have had to quarantine twice. When kids have to stay home from school either because they are ill or they have to quarantine, their parents may need to take off from work as well, leading to lost workdays, or pay for childcare, which can be a financial burden for many families. While these societal costs have not been well-quantified, one study of an outbreak in Washington state cited in the Hopkins &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found the productivity loss cost $18,065 per case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Despite the claim that these changes are about freedom, they are going to subject residents to a future of increased disease. The truth is that high levels of community immunization keep dangerous diseases in check. For example, vaccination has contributed to the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/03/measles-elimination-status-canada-united-states-mexico/"&gt;elimination&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the Americas, a status that is now under threat. &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/childhood-hib-vaccines-case-study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HiB&lt;/a&gt; vaccines have nearly wiped out one of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in children, and since the introduction of the universal birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, infectious from this virus have declined 99%, protecting thousands of Americans from liver cancer and other chronic illnesses. These immunizations protect vaccinated individuals as well as the communities in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The choice that one person makes not to vaccinate has real costs for their neighbors, including vulnerable babies at risk of infection, taxpayers who must foot the cost of responding to outbreaks, and the broader community that is forced to shoulder the health and financial burden of increased disease, such as caregiving and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political leaders may choose to insist that immunization is just a matter of personal choice. But by adopting policies that will spread disease, they are endangering the very people they claim to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

It was in a lab at Harvard, while an undergraduate in the late 1970s, where he had this realization: A castrated male lizard put in a cage with a female would not perform its mating ritual and would be uninterested in the female; but the same lizard, dosed with testosterone in the areas of the brain sensitive to testosterone, would — its dewlap coming out, head bobbing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is what he thought about when, about a decade later and a newly minted urologist, he began dosing men with testosterone. The patients were miserable, complaining of a lack of sex drive so severe it was ruining their relationships and lives. They were often coming for a second, third, even fourth opinion, after other specialists had been unable to help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Could they be like the lizards? Could testosterone help them? But there was a problem. “In my training residency, I was taught that if a healthy man got an injection of testosterone today, he would come back in one month with prostate cancer,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, testosterone treatment was limited to a few rare cases of severe hypogonadism, and no one — or no one that Morgentaler knew of — was even considering dosing men who had gone through puberty with the hormone. But his patients were so desperate that even as he discussed the risk of prostate cancer and demanded they get a biopsy to make sure they didn’t already have any cancer (an invasive, painful procedure at a time when anesthetizing the prostate was challenging), they were willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So was he. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He started measuring patients’ testosterone levels, which he had never done in his training, and by trial and error landed on dosage and protocols that worked for them. He monitored their progress, and took note of the benefits they were reporting, which often included improved mood or better stamina. “I have to tell you, it was scary,” said Morgentaler, now a Blavatnik faculty fellow in health and longevity at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The benefits were obvious to me and I felt like I had this magic sauce that nobody else had. It didn’t feel right: I was too young a guy, not established well,” he said. “I worried that I was making a deal with the devil that the men were getting benefits now, but maybe I was putting them at risk, and they would get prostate cancer later on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Except, his patients weren’t getting sick. Not after a month, or many months. “The first indication I had there was something wrong with the story was my guys were doing well. I was monitoring them like crazy,” he said, noting that urologists “see themselves as protectors of the prostate,” so putting this particular organ at risk was especially concerning to him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took four decades, but the medical consensus now aligns with his clinical evidence: testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2813293#:~:text=Findings%20During%2014%20304%20person,not%20differ%20significantly%20between%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;does not increase their risk&lt;/a&gt; of prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation with STAT, Morgentaler discussed what led to decades of shunning of testosterone treatment, as well as why this hormone continues to be “medically politicized” even as study after study confirms its safety and benefit for men with low levels of testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you started practicing in the late 1980s, testosterone therapy had been all but nonexistent in the U.S. for decades — why so? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the universal belief that testosterone causes prostate cancer. The teaching was that eunuchs — men who had lost their testicles — never got prostate cancer. Today, I can tell you that there’s no basis for that, but that was universally believed and taught. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What propelled me into national awareness around testosterone was that right away I found prostate cancer in these men who should have never had prostate cancer because they had low testosterone. The belief was if you had low testosterone, you should be protected for life — but we didn’t just find some cancers, we found a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there was a time when testosterone was widely used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a golden period for testosterone use in the late 1930s up to 1940, after the identification and the synthesis of testosterone by three Nobel Prize winner groups in 1935.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1940, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM194005232222104" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; article, Dr. Joseph Aub talks about it as one of the most potent medications in the doctor’s armamentarium. He describes many of the things we recognize today: people were using testosterone for angina, with excellent results; they used it for vascular lesions that were not healing — excellent results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1941, that golden era ended. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fellow named Charles Huggins &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/545269" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; with his co-author, Clarence Hodges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He wrote that in men with metastatic prostate cancer, when he removed the testicles or gave estrogen to lower testosterone, the acid phosphatase [an enzyme that is elevated in cases in patients with prostate cancer] came down, and in every case in which he gave testosterone, the acid phosphatase rose. He concluded that testosterone activated prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you eventually found out it wasn’t so. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d heard of this on the first day of urology training. Huggins, he went on to win the Nobel Prize, he’s the most important figure in urology ever, he’s like a god in urology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have access to anybody’s library that had articles going back to 1941, so I had to go to the medical library at Harvard: you go down the basement and they’ve got the archives, they’ve got the journals. I found the dusty thing — I’m blowing dust off of this thick volume — and I read the article. And I got so nervous because there’s Huggins, in black and white, saying “every patient I gave testosterone to his acid phosphatase went up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last sentence of the article says testosterone injections activate prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I’m thinking: “I’ve got 100s of patients now on testosterone, my guys are gonna get cancer, Huggins says so.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I forced myself to reread the article as if I needed to present it, and asked basic questions: How many patients did he treat? How many patients that he had castrated?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it turned out that he only gave testosterone injections to three men. Of the three, he only gave results for two of them. One of those men had already been castrated. In the end, there’s really just one man previously untreated who got testosterone, and his blood test results are all over the place. It’s uninterpretable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was based on one patient treated for 18 days. That was the basis for the next 60 years of physicians being unwilling to treat men with testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s an unbelievable thing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The review you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMra022251" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;published in 2004&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; showing there was no compelling scientific evidence that testosterone treatment leads to prostate cancer marked the beginning of a new era for testosterone. More studies since have confirmed its safety profile, yet a kind of ambivalence toward testosterone therapy still lingers. Why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the best scientists are very susceptible to narratives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone has been medically politicized, and you have these camps that are too polarized. You have the, let’s call them “establishment” academic medical people. They have opinions about testosterone that are not based on clinical experience. They have a pre-formed idea that it has limited value, that there are very few real candidates, and since they don’t treat patients, they get no feedback from them. And then you have the people who think that it’s the answer to everything. And of course that leaves a lot of room in between. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what the field has to fight: an a priori belief that people already know what testosterone is, and its reputation is actually dismal. And it’s not just the medical community that has this, it’s that everybody in the world has heard the word testosterone and everybody seems to have an opinion about it, as a stand-in for what people think male energy or masculinity is about. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not so long since testosterone has been rehabilitated in medicine. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that it’s such a recent phenomenon, if you will, shows up in a couple of different ways. First of all, it’s not taught in medical school, as a rule. Unless the medical school education involves almost exclusively a urologist who practices sexual medicine, it won’t be taught at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re an educator in medicine, there’s a good chance that your training occurred before the introduction of so much testosterone and testosterone research. For many of us, once we leave medical school and residency, our attitudes are often formed and set, and our beliefs about certain things are well established. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re really only one generation removed, and so I think it’ll take time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This shows some parallels with what happened with the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5477644/menopause-hormone-therapy-fda-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women’s Health Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: It took two decades to remove the “black label” warning for estrogen therapy for menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wrote a paper once with some colleagues about hormonophobia, and I think the common thing is about sex. It’s not that they’re hormones, like nobody has this feeling about thyroid hormone; it’s sexual hormones. It’s about a certain level of repression and discomfort around sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You often talk about how testosterone highlights some of medicine’s weak spots as a discipline more broadly, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s lost in the discussion of testosterone is what the impact is on an individual and how they experience life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[When I started prescribing testosterone], I didn’t know what was supposed to happen because it wasn’t taught, it wasn’t in the textbooks. So I asked my patients what they noticed, and the responses were fascinating, and I didn’t quite know what to do with all of it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My hope was that the sexual symptoms would get better and for most of these guys, they did improve. That was great, but they said other things outside of sex that I didn’t have any way to anticipate. I heard things like, “I wake up in the morning with a sense of optimism. I haven’t felt that way in many years”; “my wife likes me again … she thinks I am nicer to her.” Men would say, “I have confidence, I’d forgotten how I used to feel that way.” One guy said, “now that I’m on testosterone, what I see is that before I was seeing the world in black and white, and now I see it in color.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is a brain hormone and it has a lot of functions. One of the things that the research has shown, and our patients tell us regularly, is that their mood has improved. But it’s difficult in medicine to come up with instruments that necessarily capture the range of human experience. And one of the problems in what I call the evidence-based era is two things that have been almost completely dismissed: One is clinical experience, and the other is patient symptoms and experience. I was taught to not pay attention to what patients say because it’s not reliable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that medicine has lost its humanity in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

How everyday Indian foods raise heart disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how diet affects heart health, Dr Sunil Kumar Mandal, consultant cardiologist at Kailash Hospital, Greater Noida, warned that Indians are developing heart disease nearly 10–15 years earlier than Western populations, making &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-you-eat-a-meal-too-fast-it-might-be-time-to-slow-down-know-these-tips-for-mindful-eating-101745220968142.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="mindful eating"&gt;mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; essential. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to him, common staples such as deep-fried foods, refined carbohydrates like white rice and maida, and high-sodium items such as pickles and papads can raise cholesterol, spike blood sugar and increase blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He advised prioritising a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains and healthy fats, along with portion control and healthier cooking methods like steaming and baking to protect heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Why winter months increase risk of heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Rajesh T R, Director and Senior Consultant, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS) at KIMS Hospitals, Bengaluru, explained that winter weather can significantly strain heart health.&lt;/span&gt; Cold temperatures cause blood vessels to constrict, raising &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the heart to work harder, while sudden exposure to cold can trigger spikes in heart rate and reduce oxygen supply, especially risky for those with blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/10/550x309/heart_attack_winter3_1765369600816_1765369619874.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)" title="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Winter also increases the risk of respiratory infections, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, and thicker blood, all of which elevate the chances of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To reduce risk, he advised dressing warmly, staying physically active indoors, eating heart-healthy foods, staying hydrated, and closely managing existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Why heart attack symptoms in women often get missed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Sanjay Kumar, Senior Director of Cardiology at Fortis Hospital, Faridabad, explains that heart attack symptoms in women are often difficult to detect because they are usually subtle and atypical.&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Women tend to have smaller coronary vessels and more diffuse plaque, which makes the disease harder to diagnose and increases the risk of recurrence,” he says, adding that, unlike men, women may not experience classic chest pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, warning signs can include jaw or upper &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/back-pain" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="back pain"&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt;, nausea, palpitations, unexplained sweating, and breathlessness even during light activity, symptoms that are often mistaken for stress, acidity, or fatigue. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He emphasises that while these signs may overlap with other conditions, experiencing one or more should prompt a timely medical evaluation to rule out underlying heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. What slow heart rate (bradycardia) means for your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Dilip Kumar, Senior Interventional Cardiologist and Device Specialist at Manipal Hospital, Kolkata, explains that bradycardia is a condition in which the heart consistently beats slower than 60 beats per minute, which can be concerning as it may reduce the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the body.&lt;/span&gt; “While a slow &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/womans-entire-skin-peels-off-like-a-snake-after-a-spider-bite-my-heart-rate-was-stuck-between-140-160-for-days-101766048478518.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart rate"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; can be normal in athletes, in others it may point to a problem with the heart’s electrical system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/05/550x309/slow_heart_rate_1759631860553_1759631869382.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="While an abnormal heart rhythm with a fast heart rate can range from mild to life-threatening, often people ignore a slow heart rate.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older adults, people with heart disease, diabetes or kidney issues, and those on certain medications are at higher risk and should be cautious. Common warning signs include persistent fatigue, dizziness, fainting spells, breathlessness during mild activity, and chest discomfort. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Although not all causes are preventable, Dr Kumar notes that a heart-healthy lifestyle, stress management, and regular medical check-ups can help lower the risk and detect issues early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Festive indulgence and its hidden impact on heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Abhijit Khadtare, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-experience-reveals-the-1-number-resting-heart-quietly-reveals-how-strong-your-heart-really-is-101766370110581.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiologist"&gt;cardiologist&lt;/a&gt; at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, shared that while festive celebrations are not inherently dangerous, the drastic lifestyle changes that often come with them can pose serious risks for people with heart disease and diabetes. He noted that hospitals typically witness a post-holiday rise in emergency admissions related to heart attacks, uncontrolled blood sugar levels and blood pressure crises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to him, common festive challenges include overeating foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, disrupted sleep and medication routines, alcohol consumption, and emotional exhaustion from socialising and travel, all of which can strain the heart and upset metabolic balance even over a short period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Men are mostly diagnosed with skin cancer, and cancer of lungs, prostate, bladder and colon. The most frequent cancers in elderly women are breast cancer, skin cancer and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The main reason for the rise is the increasingly elderly population, researchers said. If the accelerated rise materialises, some 32,600 people over 80 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2032. In 2019, that number was 18,700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elderly patients are less likely to profit from new, systemic therapies, such as immunotherapy and targeted treatment, the research showed. “This group makes other decisions when it comes to treatment, and that is logical. We need to find the right balance between quality of life and life extension,” senior researcher Melinda Schuurman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of cancer sufferers will put more pressure on the health system because they will also present other health problems. “We need more research to predict which treatment benefits individual patients, enabling patients and their doctors to decide on the most suitable treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"&gt;&lt;h6 class="h3 pt-0 text-serif text-success"&gt; Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p class="small"&gt; We could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
