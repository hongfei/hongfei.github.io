Talking about this, Dr. Sudhanshu Rai- Metabolic doctor and Sports Physio- revealed the 10 early signs of high blood sugar and insulin resistance one must notice before it’s too late. "Awareness is the first step— listen to your body and take action early," he wrote in the post.

Dr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sudhir-kumar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sudhir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a neurologist from Hyderabad, experienced this struggle firsthand when his weight reached 100 kilograms. However, through steady, practical lifestyle changes, he managed to shed 30 kilograms over two years — a transformation that not only changed his physical appearance but also his overall health and confidence. Dr. Kumar’s journey, shared openly on social media, offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone hoping to make lasting changes without resorting to extreme diets or grueling exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="4470428" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-journey" source="Orion"&gt;fitness journey&lt;/keyword&gt;: Overcoming &lt;keyword id="28749874" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-struggles" source="Orion"&gt;weight struggles&lt;/keyword&gt; amid a busy schedule revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting his fitness journey in late 2020, Dr. Kumar found himself trapped in a cycle that many people struggling with weight can relate to. His work as a neurologist demanded 16 to 17-hour days, leaving very little time for self-care. The long hours meant he often slept just 4 to 5 hours a night, which severely impacted his energy levels and metabolism. On top of this, his diet was far from ideal — frequent overeating, regular consumption of junk food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks added fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physically, the consequences were evident. Walking even five kilometers was a major challenge for him, and he experienced difficulty with stamina and endurance. It was clear that drastic changes were needed, but they had to fit into the reality of a busy medical professional’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How limiting work hours enabled Dr. Kumar to focus on &lt;keyword id="865258" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-and-nutrition" source="Orion"&gt;fitness and nutrition&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes Dr. Kumar made was to significantly reduce his working hours. By limiting his workday to 8-9 hours, he was able to reclaim precious time to focus on his health and well-being. This shift was crucial because it not only reduced stress but also allowed him to prioritize exercise and proper meal preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the impact of work-life balance on health. Dr. Kumar’s example highlights how setting boundaries around work can directly contribute to better physical and mental wellness, making it easier to adopt and maintain healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How better sleep helped Dr. Kumar regulate appetite and boost metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of Dr. Kumar’s transformation was improving his sleep quality. Increasing his nightly sleep to 7-8 hours was a game changer. Sleep plays a vital role in regulating the hormones that control hunger and fullness. Without adequate rest, the body tends to produce more ghrelin (which increases appetite) and less leptin (which signals fullness), making it harder to avoid overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sleep supports metabolic health, aids muscle recovery, and boosts mental clarity — all of which are essential for maintaining an active lifestyle and making good dietary choices. By prioritizing sleep, Dr. Kumar laid a solid foundation for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How cutting refined carbs and increasing protein aids lasting weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to nutrition, Dr. Kumar took a balanced and realistic approach. He stopped drinking soft drinks altogether and cut down drastically on junk food and sugary treats, which are often major contributors to unwanted weight gain. Instead of following a fad diet, he focused on reducing his carbohydrate intake — especially refined carbs — while increasing the amount of protein he consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is known to help keep you feeling full longer and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. This thoughtful adjustment in his diet allowed Dr. Kumar to shed pounds without feeling deprived or hungry, making the changes sustainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How consistent running helped him lose weight and improve his health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar didn’t rush into intense exercise. He started slow, walking five kilometers even though it was difficult at first. Over the course of several weeks, he gradually increased his distance to 10 kilometers, building endurance at a comfortable pace. Eventually, he transitioned into slow jogging and then running, focusing more on how long he stayed active rather than how fast he went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helped him avoid injury and burnout. Later, in December 2022, he added strength training sessions three times a week, which helped build muscle, improve metabolism, and further enhance his body composition. The combination of aerobic activity and resistance training proved to be a winning formula for his sustained weight loss. Over time, Dr. Kumar’s dedication to running became apparent through the impressive distances he covered. In 2021, he averaged 15 kilometers per day, completed 339 runs of 10 kilometers or more, ran 69 half marathons, and even completed a full marathon. The following year, while slightly reducing his daily average to 12.6 kilometers, he still managed 304 runs of 10 kilometers or more, along with 43 half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical transformation was impressive, but Dr. Kumar experienced benefits far beyond the number on the scale. Losing 30 kilograms brought a remarkable increase in energy and stamina. He reported feeling more focused and productive in both his professional and personal life. Alongside these changes, his self-confidence soared, reflecting the powerful impact of improved health on mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests showed improvements across the board. His resting heart rate dropped from 72 to an impressively low 40-42 beats per minute, indicating better cardiovascular fitness. Key health markers such as blood sugar levels (HbA1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure all improved, lowering his risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips from Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="2835833" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-loss-journey" source="Orion"&gt;weight loss journey&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Dr. Kumar stresses the importance of consistency. Showing up to exercise regularly matters more than pushing yourself to run faster or harder every day. He encourages people to focus on enjoying the activity and listening to their bodies instead of chasing personal bests or competing with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also highlights the value of cross-training — incorporating various forms of exercise to keep workouts interesting and reduce injury risk. Diet-wise, he advises mindful eating, suggesting that reducing overall calorie intake and possibly experimenting with time-restricted eating can be beneficial, though it should be tailored to individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he underlines the non-negotiable role of good sleep in any fitness journey, reminding us that 7-8 hours per night is essential for optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The information shared in this article is based on Dr. Sudhir Kumar’s personal health journey and is intended for informational and inspirational purposes only.

And managing those family bonds required more brainpower, which may have led to greater intelligence and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some other animals couple up in similar ways to humans, most don’t, so love may be one of the missing links that helped us evolve from apes to us. But in order to persuade our less-evolved ancestors to share responsibilities (and food) with another person, love had to have some pretty huge benefits — like the nine listed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If two people are truly in love, they'll unlock these pretty awesome health perks:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

And here’s a great one: doing so will boost your energy, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-08-physical-psychological-power.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors tested participants’ blood glucose levels before and after they thought about their partners and found that they experienced a boost at 10 and 25 minutes after.

But when you’re ready to get back to it, your significant other can help you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples who diet or exercise together have a better chance at long-term success than those who go it alone, according to a study from &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091401" rel="nofollow"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt;. It makes sense, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, it’s harder to clean up your diet when your guy is chowing down on all your old favorites in front of you.

Being in a loving relationship typically means having someone who encourages healthy behaviors, notices when something's wrong with your health, and provides crucial stress-relief during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/know-you-found-your-soulmate"&gt;10 Signs From The Universe You've Met Your Soulmate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Today, about 57 million people live with dementia worldwide, and Alzheimer’s disease causes most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors rely on interviews, brief cognitive checks, and brain scans when available. A clinically available blood test now offers another option that is simple, fast, and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagging-alzheimer-s-in-blood"&gt;Flagging Alzheimer’s in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team was led by Sebastian Palmqvist at &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden. Their goal was clear: make an accurate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that a regular clinic can use to flag Alzheimer’s biology in people with memory concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a prospective study of 1,213 patients seen in both family practices and specialty memory clinics, a serum panel correctly identified Alzheimer’s pathology about 88 to 92 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That performance was on par with the accuracy seen when samples were analyzed in batches or as they arrived, which matches how clinics actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test looks for a specific biomarker in plasma called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10066514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphorylated tau 217&lt;/a&gt;, often shortened to p-tau217. It also reads the ratio of amyloid beta 42 to amyloid beta 40, two forms of a protein linked to plaques in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements rise or fall in characteristic ways when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-simple-nighttime-sleep-habit-could-delay-or-prevent-alzheimers-in-all-adults/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology is present. By combining them, the test gives a single probability score that tracks the biology behind memory loss, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-help-for-primary-care-doctors"&gt;Help for primary care doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary care doctors’ accuracy in identifying Alzheimer’s disease was 61 per cent, while specialist physicians were correct 73 per cent of the time,” added &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/sebastian-palmqvist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Palmqvist&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor of Neurology at Lund University and consultant at &lt;a href="https://vard.skane.se/psykiatri-skane/mottagningar-och-avdelningar/akutmottagning-barn--och-ungdomspsykiatri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Skåne&lt;/a&gt; University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the test’s performance with doctors’ best clinical judgment before any biomarker results were known and those numbers show why an easy lab test can help the first clinicians who see most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier and more accurate classification steers people to the right next step. It also reduces unnecessary referrals for expensive imaging when the blood test rules out Alzheimer’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-aps2-score"&gt;Inside the APS2 score&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab algorithm, sometimes called APS2, blends the p-tau217 percentage with the amyloid ratio to estimate the chance of amyloid positivity in the brain. Ratios help account for unrelated medical factors that can nudge a single marker up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02869-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that percent p-tau217 in blood closely matches the clinical performance of Food and Drug Administration (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;) cleared cerebrospinal fluid tests for detecting Alzheimer’s pathology. Accuracy climbs even higher when labs use two cutoff values, one to rule in and one to rule out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will still need other information in some cases. A subgroup will land in an intermediate zone, which is a cue to order a PET scan or repeat testing rather than guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-current-treatments"&gt;How this fits with current treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments that target amyloid require proof of amyloid biology before they start. The FDA granted traditional approval for &lt;em&gt;lecanemab&lt;/em&gt;, marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-converts-novel-alzheimers-disease-treatment-traditional-approval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leqembi&lt;/a&gt;, for early symptomatic Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also approved &lt;em&gt;donanemab&lt;/em&gt;, now sold as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, for adults with early symptoms and confirmed amyloid pathology. As access to these drugs grows, fast triage in regular clinics becomes more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is already available in the USA and is likely to become available in many other countries soon. Initially, it will mainly be used in specialist memory clinics, and it may take approximately one to two years to implement guidelines and training in primary care,” concluded &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/oskar-hansson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oskar Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Neurology at Lund University and senior consultant at Skåne University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood draw in a familiar clinic setting lowers the barrier for people who cannot travel far or wait long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-blood-and-healthcare"&gt;Alzheimer’s, blood, and healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine blood test is less invasive than a cerebrospinal fluid tap and easier to schedule than advanced imaging. Results can arrive quickly, which helps families move from uncertainty to a clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accurate negative result can spare people from months of worry and unnecessary tests. A positive result, combined with a clinical assessment, helps providers arrange the right counseling, safety steps, and referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test does not replace a full evaluation. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brains-quiet-moments-may-shape-memory-and-fight-alzheimers/"&gt;Memory&lt;/a&gt; changes can come from depression, sleep problems, medications, or other neurological diseases, so clinicians still need to take a careful history and examine the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No test is perfect. A small fraction of results will fall between the lower and upper cutoffs, and that gray zone is best handled with follow up testing or specialty referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local policies will shape how primary clinics use the assay alongside cognitive exams and imaging. Training and clear workflows will help teams decide when to test, how to interpret results, and when to refer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will keep studying how comorbid conditions, age, and disease stage affect performance. Automated platforms and standardized reporting should make it easier for labs to deliver consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:16:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNUzhac0pPbDc1X28tMXRJQndSd3RHaE9hS0lQQ05LWDBRN1hMOHhLLTFiU3loTHMyMGxwOENzTDA1SVRoVVR6dGJJMnJfN0xtWXBtNGtEbjhFQTM5RDR3Y2d0T1ZCeHdGRmNxQTNJWXdpZWpkNkxaMGFub1J2NGhiOG9qdkgwSlR4aHF4anlyQlVONXpPdjVLZ0NhMUZlNVdEdEZkY0U0Um9tcWdIRlRyZUNPTQ</guid></item><item><title>100%有效的癌症疫苗？俄罗斯的Enteromix在试验中取得成功；以下是完整的报告-《经济时报》</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/news/new-updates/a-100-effective-cancer-vaccine-russias-enteromix-achieves-success-in-trials-heres-the-full-report-you-need-to-read/articleshow/123749832.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="21" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine that could change the way we fight cancer is making headlines. Russia’s Enteromix has reportedly achieved 100% efficacy in preclinical trials, showing both safety and strong tumour-fighting abilities, according to a report by Tass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronika Skvortsova, head of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency (FMBA), revealed the results at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123749832" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research spanned several years, with the last three dedicated to mandatory preclinical studies. The vaccine is now ready for use; we are awaiting official approval,” Tass quoted her as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skvortsova stressed that repeated administration of the vaccine remained safe, while also showing impressive results. Tumour growth slowed by 60–80%, survival rates improved, and significant reductions in tumour size were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First target: colorectal cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine’s initial focus will be on colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. But the research does not stop there. Scientists are also developing versions for glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumour, and specific types of melanoma, including ocular melanoma, all of which are at advanced stages of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123749832" id="div-vdoai-mid-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate vaccines with childhood diseases such as measles or chickenpox. These train the immune system to recognise dangerous germs. Cancer vaccines work on a similar principle, but instead of viruses, they help the body spot and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123749832" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, some cancer vaccines already exist for bladder and prostate cancers, while the HPV vaccine prevents several types of cancer before they begin.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you open the fridge to look for a snack, what’s the first thing you are reaching for? For many, the answer is yogurt! There’s plenty to love about yogurt—it’s a creamy and satisfying snack option that also offers a variety of health benefits, from improved digestion to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention all of the essential nutrients—like calcium—that it provides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;up their calcium intake&lt;/a&gt; (a lot of us aren’t getting enough), it makes sense that yogurt is often a top pick. The recommended daily amount of calcium for adults is 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams, and just 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt provides 488 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beyond calcium’s well-known role in bone health, your heart, muscles and nerves also need this essential mineral to function properly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But if you’re tired of your daily yogurt bowl, it isn’t the only high-calcium snack option out there. Here are some other dietitian-recommended healthy snacks that have more calcium than a cup of yogurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-healthy-snacks-that-have-more-calcium-than-a-cup-of-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4 Healthy Snacks That Have More Calcium Than a Cup of Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Sardines with Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tuna isn’t the only snackable seafood—sardines are another tasty fish that deserves a spot in your lineup. Not only are they a great &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, sardines are especially rich in calcium too. “Most of the calcium in our bodies—more than 99%—is stored in our bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And that’s true for fish as well. Sardine bones are soft and edible, so when you enjoy sardines, you’re loading up on the calcium stored in their skeleton,” says &lt;a href="https://www.alyssanorthrop.com/about-alyssa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Alyssa Northrop, M.P.H., RD, LMT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A can of sardines provides as much as 351 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While that’s just shy of the total calcium you’ll score from a cup of yogurt, you can easily boost it by adding some cheese. One ounce of Cheddar cheese provides 199 mg calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A tasty way to enjoy sardines is to make sardine crackers by layering a cracker, sharp Cheddar cheese and sardines,” suggests &lt;a href="https://delightfullyfueled.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Alsing, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Chia Seed Pudding &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds don’t just help you poop, they are also surprisingly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7944380/easy-high-calcium-dinner-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in calcium&lt;/a&gt;. Just 1 ounce of chia seeds—about 2 tablespoons—provides 179 mg calcium or 14% of your daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soaking the chia seeds in milk to create the pudding adds even more calcium to the tally. Of course, any mix-ins you include to add more protein or flavor may also tack on more calcium. For example, this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-blueberry-peanut-butter-chia-pudding-11713745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein blueberry and peanut butter chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; provides an impressive 729 mg of calcium for a breakfast-size portion, but even pared down a little for snacking it still has an edge over plain yogurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Cereal and Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good news for cereal lovers—this convenient breakfast option also makes a great calcium-rich snack, especially when you add a splash of milk. Here’s the rundown. A serving of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/153679/how-to-pick-the-healthiest-breakfast-cereal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified toasted oats cereal&lt;/a&gt; offers around 100 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But once you add 1 cup of low-fat milk, the calcium total for this snack goes up to an impressive 414 mg calcium or 32% of the daily recommendation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, dairy milk isn’t the only milk that can boost the calcium in your bowl. Nondairy alternatives like soy, almond and even oat milk are often fortified with calcium to help you score enough in your diet. For example, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/almond-milk-health-benefits-8387408" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified almond milk&lt;/a&gt; will provide a whopping 422 mg per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, “This is also a great choice for those requiring a dairy-free option.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Green Smoothie &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dark leafy greens are a rich source of calcium, but munching on a handful of greens for a snack isn’t very appealing. One simple way to make them more palatable is to toss a handful into a smoothie. And if you include other calcium-rich ingredients in the mix, like chia seeds and calcium-fortified almond milk, it can really add up! If you need some inspiration, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/green-smoothie-11778323" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green smoothie recipe&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a whopping 676 mg of calcium per serving—that’s more than half the recommended calcium for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-notable-mentions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Notable Mentions &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If none of those calcium-rich snacks suit your taste buds, our dietitians had a few other notable snack mentions that are worth entertaining:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortified orange juice&lt;/strong&gt;: “I recommend fortified orange juice—many brands provide 300 mg of calcium in an 8-ounce glass, and it’s an easy, familiar choice for kids and adults,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that you can even freeze it into popsicle molds for a frozen treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mozzarella cheese snack plate: &lt;/strong&gt;Create a simple snack plate that’s packed with calcium by combining one stick of mozzarella string cheese, 1 ounce of unsalted almonds, and 1 cup of blackberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This easy-to-assemble combo racks up the calcium, providing about 325 mg or about 25% of your daily needs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canned salmon:&lt;/strong&gt; Sardines aren’t the only canned fish that’s packed with calcium. “Canned salmon is a convenient, high-calcium, high-protein and omega-3-rich snack that can be enjoyed as a sandwich, salmon patties or straight out of the can,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. One can of pink salmon and bones provides up to 302 mg of calcium, about 23% of the recommended daily intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tofu chocolate pudding:&lt;/strong&gt; Tofu can be an unexpectedly good source of calcium, since many brands use calcium sulfate to help solidify the soy milk to make tofu. For example, 1 cup of firm tofu provides as much as 506 mg calcium, or almost 40% of your daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, M.A.N., RD&lt;/a&gt;, one way to use tofu in a snack is to blend it into a pudding with calcium-fortified plant-based milk, cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla and a dash of salt. Snacking on a half-cup of this pudding provides over 200 mg of calcium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is likely one of the first snack foods that comes to mind when you need to increase your calcium intake. But if you’re feeling bored with your daily yogurt snack, there are plenty of other options that provide just as much (if not more!) calcium. Dietitians suggest adding chia pudding, green smoothies, canned sardines with cheese and calcium-fortified cereal with milk to your snack rotation. You’ll be adding plenty of variety to banish boredom and hit the mark on the recommended daily intake of this essential nutrient.&lt;br&gt;

While many people know these crunchy green seeds help balance blood sugar levels, there’s a lot more to them than meets the eye. According to U.S.-based gastroenterologist Dr. Pal Manickam, pumpkin seeds are one of the most underrated superfoods you can easily include in your diet, and they’re surprisingly affordable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram video and a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dr. Pal shares seven science-backed reasons to add pumpkin seeds to your daily routine. “If you're not including pumpkin seeds in your diet, you're seriously missing out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123668491" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what makes these little seeds so powerful? Let’s break down the seven benefits he shared, including one he calls his personal favourite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;1. Boosts Immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, a key mineral that strengthens the immune system and helps your body fight infections more effectively. Including them in your meals can be a tasty way to keep seasonal illnesses at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;2. Supports Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to their high magnesium content, pumpkin seeds help maintain a steady heartbeat and regulate blood pressure. Magnesium is also known to support overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123668491" id="div-vdoai-mid-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123668491" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3. Improves Mood and Relaxation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds contain tryptophan, an amino acid that converts into serotonin, the “feel-good” hormone. This can help improve mood, reduce anxiety, and promote better sleep, something many people overlook when managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;4. Strengthens Bones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds also offer a good dose of phosphorus and magnesium, which are essential for bone strength and density. Regular consumption may reduce your risk of conditions like osteoporosis later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;5. Balances Blood Sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-known benefit, pumpkin seeds help regulate insulin levels and keep blood sugar in check, thanks again to their magnesium content. This makes them a smart snack option for people managing diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN-q3UmCZKU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;6. Helps with Cravings and Weight Loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pal’s personal favourite benefit: curbing cravings. Packed with healthy fats and protein, pumpkin seeds keep you full for longer, making it easier to avoid mindless snacking and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;7. Protects Skin and Eyes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded with antioxidants like vitamin E and carotenoids, these seeds help reduce inflammation, slow signs of aging, and protect your eyes and skin from damage caused by environmental stress.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is Dr Pal Manickam?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the unversed, Dr. Pal Manickam is not your average doctor. Known for mixing health advice with humour, he has built a large following across social media. He shares easy-to-understand, science-based health tips, often focusing on gut health, intermittent fasting, and holistic wellness. Dr. Pal completed his MBBS at PSG Medical College, Coimbatore, India, then a Master's in Public Health at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and an MD in Internal Medicine at Wayne State University, Detroit, before steeping into gastroenterology fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pumpkin Seeds vs Flax and Chia seeds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, pumpkin seeds stand out as a simple yet powerful superfood. While flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fiber and omega-3s, pumpkin seeds don’t need grinding and offer a wider variety of nutrients, including zinc, magnesium, and protein. This makes them an easy, all-in-one option for daily nutrition.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-align="" data-msid="123668794" data-type="image" class="midImg clearfix"&gt;&lt;figure

months-long &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;limb-lengthening procedures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; is using her experience (and new look) to raise awareness for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;genetic disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chandler Crews, 31, who heads up the nonprofit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chandler Project, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;tells a heartrending tale of expecting to grow up and be just like her sister, but was sorely disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

underwent multiple limb-lengthening surgeries starting at age 16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her procedures corrected bowed legs, reduced pain, and allowed her to live more independently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, when she turned 16, the answer came in the form of three bone-cutting and stretching operations for her legs and arms, which, fortunately, were deemed necessary and thus covered by her life insurance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, she stands a proud 4 feet 11 and is using every inch to spread the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chandler Crews could say

her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For so long, the compliments and kind remarks I received, and thought were genuine, were really just a facade,” she recalled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While her brother was being complimented for his intelligence and her sister lauded for her art, Crews would get a pat on the head for “just being…me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She remembers feeling like a “show dog” because of the head patting and people wanting to shake her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the age of 16, she started speaking up and telling these individuals that she did not like being touched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote

data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her assertiveness resulted in calls for her parents to discipline her because she was “unmannered.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aside from the pain that influenced her decision to get the limb-lengthening procedures, she “just wanted to be normal”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crews started her limb-lengthening procedures at the same age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At 16, I spent seven months in and out of a wheelchair,” she recalled, and then underwent the procedure again three years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These detracted from her parents’ narrative on embracing her dwarfism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="471976723_18472560655014644_7549277363499341291_n-68bd91facf985__700"

My legs were so bowed I was going to need to straighten them. And with their malalignment, it was causing hip and back pain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Her second biggest priority was: “I also just wanted to be normal.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wanted to go to college and live in the dorm with my best friend, and walk class to class across campus. I didn’t want to ask for help from Student Disability Services.

			&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-26/what-foods-and-recipes-are-high-in-protein/105318830"&gt;hype around protein&lt;/a&gt; intake doesn't seem to be going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media is full of people urging you to eat more protein, including via supplements such as protein shakes. Food companies have also started highlighting protein content on food packages to promote sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is all the extra protein giving us any benefit – and can you have too much protein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein's important – but many eat more than they need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating enough protein is important. It helps form muscle tissue, enzymes and hormones and it plays a role in immune function. It can also give you energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-added-protein-really-enhance-the-nutrition-of-your-food"&gt;Does Added Protein Really Enhance The Nutrition of Your Food?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's healthy eating guidelines, penned by experts and backed by government, &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/chronic-disease/macronutrient-balance"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; we get 15–25% of our daily energy needs from protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/protein"&gt;recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt; of protein for adults is 0.84 grams per kilogram of body weight for men and 0.75 grams per kilogram of body weight for women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173185" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173185" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/protein_powder_brown-642x260.jpg" alt="protein powder brown" class="wp-image-173185 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/protein_powder_brown-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/protein_powder_brown-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/protein_powder_brown-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/protein_powder_brown.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173185" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Too much of a good thing? (Gabriel Vergani/EyeEm/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is about 76 grams per day for a 90 kilogram man or 53 grams per day for a 70 kilogram woman. (It's a bit more if you're &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/protein"&gt;over 70 or a child&lt;/a&gt;, though).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Australian adults are already eating &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/food-and-nutrients/latest-release#data-downloads"&gt;plenty of protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, many people still go out of their way to add even more protein to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people working to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/"&gt;increase muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; through resistance training, such as lifting weights, a protein intake up to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (that's 144 grams a day for a 90 kilogram person) can help with increasing muscle strength and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows there is no additional muscle gain benefit from eating any more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, there's no benefit in consuming protein above the recommended level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, having too much protein can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when I eat too much protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess protein is not all simply excreted from the body in urine or faeces. It stays in the body and has various effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is a source of energy, so eating more protein means &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/association-between-protein-intake-diet-quality-and-obesity-in-australian-adults-a-comparison-of-measurement-units/FFB3D60FEE631A72EFB9B5A2F3FE93D1?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;amp;utm_source=bookmark"&gt;taking in more energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume more energy than we need, our body converts any excess into fatty tissue for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some health conditions where excess protein intake should be avoided. For example, people with chronic kidney disease should closely monitor their protein intake, under the supervision of a dietitian, to avoid &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/abstract/2017/01000/dietary_protein_intake_and_chronic_kidney_disease.12.aspxFollowing"&gt;damage to the kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Priyanka-Verma-4/publication/373258761_Protein_Deficiency_and_Poisoning/links/64e4000740289f7a0faadd89/Protein-Deficiency-and-Poisoning.pdf"&gt;protein poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you eat too many proteins without getting enough fats, carbohydrates and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also known as "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33830500/"&gt;rabbit starvation&lt;/a&gt;", a term often &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180522-we-dont-need-nearly-as-much-protein-as-we-consume"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to early 20th century explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, in reference to the fact that those who subsisted on a diet of mainly rabbits (which are famously lean) quickly fell dangerously ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where you get your protein from matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can get protein in our diets from plant sources (such as beans, lentils, wholegrains) and animal sources (such as eggs, dairy, meat or fish).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high intake of protein from animal sources has been associated with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12965"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of premature death among older Australians (especially death from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="173173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High animal protein intake is also associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522046688"&gt;increased risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, consuming more plant sources of protein is associated with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animal sources of protein are also relatively high in fat, particularly saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high intake of saturated fat contributes to increased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease. Many Australians already eat &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/food-essentials/fat-salt-sugars-and-alcohol"&gt;more saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; than we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many plant sources of protein, however, are also sources of &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/food-and-nutrients/latest-release#data-downloads"&gt;dietary fibre&lt;/a&gt;, which most Australians don't get enough of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more dietary fibre helps &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/chronic-disease/summary"&gt;reduce the risk of chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; (such as heart disease) and supports &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-020-00375-4"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Striking a balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, where you get protein from – and having a balance between animal and plant sources – is more important than simply just trying to add ever more protein to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, fats and carbohydrates all work together to keep your body healthy and the engine running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need all of these macro nutrients, along with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="173173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals, in the right proportions to support our health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261849/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Below are answers to some common questions the general public may have on the new updated Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;How Many Updated Covid Vaccines Are There?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there will be three new updated Covid vaccines. A Moderna vaccine has been approved for those six months of age and older, a Pfizer vaccine for those five years of age and older, and a Novavax vaccine for those 12 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Strain(s) Will The Vaccines Protect Against?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated vaccines will target the JN.1 lineage of Covid-19, using the LP.8.1 strain. This lineage is a descendant of the Omicron variant of the virus. Currently, the dominant strain in the United States that is causing most infections is the XFG, or “stratus” variant, according to data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io" aria-label="WastewaterSCAN."&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io"&gt;WastewaterSCAN.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the XFG is a descendant of the Omicron variant and is closely related to the LP.8.1 strain of the virus, the newly updated Covid vaccines should offer protection against this dominant variant and will be effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death, per the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" aria-label="World Health Organization"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Who Can Get The Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, anyone six months of age and older were eligible to receive Covid shots. That changed recently when the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" aria-label="restricted"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929"&gt;restricted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine for those 65 years of age and older, or for younger individuals six months of age and older with an underlying condition that would put them at high risk for severe Covid infection. These individuals will likely be able to get the vaccine at various healthcare clinics and pharmacies with insurance covering the cost of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Qualifies As High Risk For Severe Covid Infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those under 65 years of age will need to have at least one medical condition that would put that at high risk for severe Covid in order to get the new updated Covid vaccine. Although it remains unclear exactly how many and what conditions qualify for putting one at severe risk for Covid infection, the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in February identified 22 qualifying conditions that include obesity, depression, diabetes, asthma and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This risk could be modified this month by the CDC since the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is set to meet September 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to make formal recommendations on the Covid vaccine. In addition, although pregnancy was included back in February as a qualifying condition for getting the Covid vaccine, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has since &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ" aria-label="stated"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ"&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that healthy pregnant individuals would not qualify to get the shots. Further clarification will likely come later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Can You Still Get The Covid Vaccine If You Want To And Do Not Qualify Under The FDA Restrictions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a healthy young adult or child that does not have an underlying condition that would put you at risk for severe Covid, in theory you could still potentially get a Covid shot, but there could be significant barriers. Most adults would need to get a prescription from their doctor and then present it at a pharmacy or health clinic to get the vaccine. For children, Secretary Kennedy is now requiring shared decision making between parents and physicians, which requires a conversation in order to possibly get a prescription for the Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there may be significant barriers for each of the above situations to play out. For example, some Americans may not have a primary care doctor, thus precluding them from getting a prescription for the Covid shot. Even if they were to get a prescription, they may not be willing to pay the $150 for the Covid vaccine, particularly if they are uninsured and have to pay the cost out of pocket. More than 27 million Americans lack health insurance, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, some physicians may be reluctant to write a prescription for the Covid vaccine “off-label” since it has not been officially recommended or approved by the FDA for a certain subset of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACIP is set to meet September 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and the outcome of that meeting and subsequent CDC approval could provide further clarification on Covid vaccine approvals and whether or not insurance companies will cover the shots, since insurance coverage for many plans is intimately tied with the recommendations from the ACIP and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a new study looking at generations of couples and their respective psychiatric issues from around the world, you might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a wide-ranging new study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:for the journal Nature Human Behavior;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;for the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looking at data from nearly 15 million people, researchers from institutions in the Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States found that both members of couples in those disparate cultures often share mental health diagnoses — and that it's been that way for more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Building on a 2016 paper &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2494707" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2494707" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; that looked solely at Swedish databases, a consortium of researchers hailing from Oklahoma's Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Denmark's Institute of Biological Psychiatry, and Taiwan's National Health Research Institutes, used national registries in those three countries to investigate how many couples share psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The psychiatric and population experts behind this newer study focused on nine mental health disorders: anorexia nervosa, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and substance-use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Separating the data into 10-year-long generational cohorts between the 1930s to the 1990s, the researchers found a slight uptick in couples sharing diagnoses — a phenomenon known in science-speak as "spousal correlations" — with each passing decade, especially for those with substance use disorder. (It's not hard to see why: recreational drug use and its dark flip-sides, abuse and addiction, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/6331/decades-drug-use-data-from-60s-70s.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exploded during the 1960s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exploded during the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The also found that when one partner was diagnosed with any of the nine disorders studied, the other was very likely to be diagnosed with one as well — and likely the same diagnosis. There were, naturally, a few caveats: Taiwanese married couples were more likely to share OCD diagnoses than their Nordic counterparts, for example, and neither bipolar disorder nor anorexia were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;exhibited in couples across all cultures either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations," explained paper author and geneticist Chun Chieh Fan of Oklahoma's Laureate Institute for Brain Research in an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview with Nature magazine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The trend has remained consistent even with massive changes in psychiatric care over the past half-century, the researcher added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though this paper didn't dig into &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people with similar mental health problems tend to sniff each other out, Fan offered up a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering," he told&lt;em&gt; Nature&lt;/em&gt;, "so they attract each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The geneticist also suggested that coming from similar environments may make people more alike, and more likely to find each other — and, tragically, that mental health stigma may make people who suffer from similar psychiatric disorders feel their dating prospects are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whatever the cause behind these wild findings, it's fascinating that so many couples from so such disparate cultures and generations seem to share mental illnesses — and in a certain light, it's almost romantic to consider that your spouse may be just as crazy as you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on relationship psychology: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/scientists-identify-ideal-amount-boinking-100048880.html" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Identify Ideal Amount of Boinking for Maximum Mental Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists Identify Ideal Amount of Boinking for Maximum Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 13:45:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNakgwaFh5NW5kUWttNWk0NEFyREx3eHhSTzZzNTV4UjNyY0VYM0Y3ZHFKUFlWb1VWWS04T2FPYkZ6R1pMRi1fc1UtdkFqc2ZIcnlvaUpkSy1ydEc0M2F6NENvTTJobVU5Ym5OVzR2N1I1R0NXQmlOSFVabkVqczdXaFluZlJqMm9rUmJiSkxwbGo</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家揭示了生长新脑细胞的最佳运动-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/neuroscientist-reveals-the-best-exercise-for-growing-new-brain-cells/articleshow/123747834.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, we were made to believe that once you reached adulthood, your brain was fixed — no new brain cells, no second chances. High school biology textbooks often repeated it as fact: neurons don’t regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s no longer the case. As Dr. Robert W. B. Love often points out, modern neuroscience has overturned that idea. In fact, a wealth of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11252770/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; research shows adult mammals (including humans, under certain conditions) can grow new neurons, especially in an area called the hippocampus, which is central to memory formation, learning, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because as we age, neuronal loss, synaptic pruning, and reduced plasticity in brain regions like the hippocampus contribute heavily to cognitive decline and increase risk for disorders like Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;BDNF and its role in new cell generation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our muscles and other tissues are active during exercise, the body releases a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;BDNF is sometimes called a “fertilizer” for the brain: it facilitates the growth of new neurons, supports dendritic branching (the connections between neurons), and helps existing neurons survive and function properly. BDNF has been strongly linked with healthy hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which exercises best boost neurogenesis?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Love has emphasized that not all exercise is equal when it comes to maximizing BDNF release and stimulating neurogenesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, he attended a neurology conference where Dr. Austin Perlmutter shared evidence that resistance training (lifting weights, body-weight exercises, etc.) might outperform aerobic training in some respects when the goal is BDNF release and neuroprotection, especially in older adults or those at risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6912783/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; too have shown positive affect of resistance training in the overall development of cognitive abilities. A 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457223002148" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that resistance training significantly increases BDNF levels in humans, though there was variability depending on training intensity, duration, and individual differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of BDNF have been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and slower cognitive decline. Though BDNF does not “cure” Alzheimer’s, boosting it through exercise is one of the strongest non-drug strategies we have.

Narrower the arteries, higher the risk of early blockage. But the worst part is, blocked artery symptoms aren’t easy to identify. Eating clean, following a healthy lifestyle aren’t enough. However, certain symptoms can be identified through standard medical tests. In a recent video Cardiovascular Surgeon Dr Jeremy London shared 4 tests that can help identify blocked arteries and lower the risk of Cardiovascular complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Track your Blood Pressure with regular check-ups&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="Doctors recommend regular blood pressure check-ups" msid="123747068" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jeremy explains blood pressure gets easily modified by lifestyle changes. According to The World Health Organisation (WHO), only 12% of the Indian population have blood pressure under control. High blood pressure is a ‘silent killer’ that increases the risk of blocked arteries as it damages the artery walls and leads to the accumulation of fatty deposits. Tracking blood pressure is critical for early detection and can lower the risk of blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Blood Panel can detect hidden risks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Advances Blood Panel goes beyond the standard blood tests. It is a set of blood tests that identifies the hidden dangers of Atherosclerosis or Plaque build-up in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a basic blood panel usually checks cholesterol and sugar, an Advances Blood Panel goes beyond that and may reveal number and type of cholesterol particles, inflammation in blood vessels and blood clotting tendency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/ask-the-doctor-heart-attack-despite-low-cholesterol" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers have found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even if cholesterol numbers are low, one can still develop blocked arteries that lead to the risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEXA Scan- measures the ‘dangerous’ body fat&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="DEXA scan can identify Visceral fat" msid="123747086" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat or the ‘dangerous’ fat around internal organs of the abdominal area is a risk factor for Artery Blockage.

DEXA Scan reveals the level of Visceral fat in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127334/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Identification of Visceral fat is crucial &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;as it secretes inflammatory proteins into the bloodstream that damage the Endothelium, the inner lining of arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;b&gt;VO2 Max test- ‘most powerful determinants of longevity’&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="VO2 Max test measures cardiovascular efficiency" msid="123747093" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth test Dr London recommends and describes as the most powerful determinants of longevity is the VO2 Max Test.

It might help you recover from motion sickness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team of researchers led by neuroscientist Yilun Li at China's Henan Institute of Science and Technology has found music may be a surprisingly effective intervention for reducing nausea and dizziness induced by travel. Depending on the song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In experiments, 30 participants were subject to a driving simulator, in which they were made to feel carsick while wearing an electroencephalograph (EEG) cap. This allowed researchers to 'read' the brain activity of volunteers in real time, as it transitioned from a stable state to a state of motion sickness, and gradually back again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants were divided into six groups. Four groups listened to a minute of music after the nauseating drive; one listened to no music after the drive, spending 1 minute meditating instead; and one ended the drive right before participants were expected to feel nauseated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mozart-can-act-as-a-painkiller-for-newborns-first-of-its-kind-trial-suggests"&gt;Mozart Can Act as a Painkiller For Newborns, First-of-Its-Kind Trial Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers found that joyful music alleviated symptoms of carsickness by 14 percent compared to the group that meditated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soft music was the next best genre. It alleviated symptoms by 13.4 percent compared to controls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, one type of music reduced nausea at a rate worse than simply waiting for the feelings of carsickness to pass. Sad music seemed to make recovery harder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173047" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-642x331.jpg" alt="Motion Sickness" class="size-medium wp-image-173047" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-642x331.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-805x415.jpg 805w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-768x396.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-1536x791.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-600x309.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001.jpg 1902w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173047" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The motion sickness experiment, which simulated a nauseating drive.

&lt;img decoding="async" class="context-img" img="" src="https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mental-health-project-logo.jpg" alt=""&gt; &lt;p class="context-lab-text font-tiny u-sans"&gt;The Mental Health Project is a Seattle Times initiative focused on covering mental and behavioral health issues.

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A question from a reader: &lt;/strong&gt;How can a bipolar patient get rid of “racing thoughts?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first sat down to answer your question, my mind instantly went to medication. What else could I talk about? As if we could clap our hands together and cleanly solve what is a quite complex and sometimes difficult experience for bipolar folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moment later, I realized I was internally perpetuating the same experience that most bipolar clients I’ve worked with have described when they share their symptoms with a practitioner — focusing on the biochemical and symptom management over the emotional and relational experiences that come with being bipolar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That glossing over reflects to me a larger cultural attitude about bipolar that influences the general public, including clinicians: Many of us don’t know enough about it or how to talk about it, so we fear it instead of being curious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-component embed-container column-width-embed u-border-t u-border-b u-border-light-gray mv-40 pv-20"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The therapist is in” is a new Seattle Times column about mental health written by Jordan Alam, a clinical social worker based in Seattle. These columns will have an anti-oppressive and trauma-informed lens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readers are welcome to email &lt;a href="mailto:askatherapist@seattletimes.com" class="content-link"&gt;askatherapist@seattletimes.com&lt;/a&gt; about their own mental health challenges, including those related to identity and social forces. Your message may be answered in a future column, though we won’t use it without getting your permission first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike anxiety and depression (and, to some extent, certain forms of PTSD), which have gone through a cultural shift, bipolar disorders are still highly stigmatized and misunderstood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know there are different subclassifications of bipolar with distinct features. All bipolar diagnoses are characterized by drastic mood shifts that are biochemical in origin, but Bipolar I is distinct from Bipolar II or cyclothymia, for example, based on whether someone has periods of higher-intensity mania versus hypomania, which is less intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And far less talked about than mania are the periods of intense depression that bipolar folks go through; this is a common symptom that can be just as debilitating and require additional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depressive episodes get less emphasized because they are more internal and private. Often we focus on how bipolar impacts other people: A manic episode is more outwardly visible, so that gets our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that I have to establish trust more gradually for someone to open up about their bipolar in session. They need to know that I as a practitioner can hold space for everything else beyond symptom management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, no one has asked how they feel about their mania or hypomania. No one has asked how they talk to their loved ones or people new in their lives about their diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, it feels like something they have to keep tight control on to be respected and to prevent them from being hospitalized (which can be a traumatizing experience and for some involves encounters with law enforcement). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person’s relationship to their bipolar will be different. Some clients resonate with it as an identity and a lens through which they uniquely see the world. Some relate to it as a part of them that they want to keep well managed and separate from the other parts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However someone makes meaning of their experience, I want my office to be a space where they feel safe to share their full selves. Maybe there are parts of bipolar that you love — like the creativity and energy to get things done that comes with a period of up energy — and parts that feel scary or shameful — like overspending or exhibiting risky behavior, or the feeling of falling off a cliff into depression. It’s OK to have all those things coexist at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relational aspect is not divorced from the biochemical; they influence each other. Bipolar is not a fixed state. If someone experiences a great stressor in their life, their mood shifts might be elevated. If there is a big break in routine or they’re getting less sleep or changes in relationships, those shifts might also come on more strongly or last longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to take a holistic look at what’s going on in your life that might influence how your bipolar is showing up, and to keep an eye on whether you’re reaching a threshold where there is potential risk of self-harm or danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To return to your direct question about racing thoughts, we can talk about it from multiple perspectives. How do you feel about the racing thoughts? What’s going on in your life that might increase them? Are there also patterns or strategies that can help return to baseline? Or does it merit a discussion about medication use or changes? How can you be compassionate with yourself when life changes and you have to shift your strategies as a result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you are connected to people in your life and practitioners who are committed to going beyond the top-line answer. And I hope that together you can find your own balance of meaning-making and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-component embed-container column-width-embed u-border-t u-border-b u-border-light-gray mv-40 pv-20"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written about men getting &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/people-are-paying-six-figures-for-leg-lengthening-surgery-instead-of-going-to-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leg-lengthening&lt;/a&gt; surgery before. They’re spending thousands of dollars and months of recovery to inch closer to six feet. But now, women are heading in the opposite direction. Not to correct deformities or injury. Just to be…shorter. In the hope that it will help them in the love department.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/heightreduction/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinics in Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; are offering a new kind of cosmetic service: limb-shortening surgery for women who believe their height is working against them romantically. And while it might sound like the setup to a dystopian rom-com, it’s very real and very painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-64458484" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-64458484" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cut the femur or tibia, remove bone, then secure what’s left with a metal rod. The upper leg can be reduced by up to 5.5 centimeters (2.2 inches), the lower leg by 3 centimeters (1.2 inches). One woman reportedly went from 172 to 167.9 centimeters (5’7¾” to 5’6″).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Most clinics promote the surgery as part of a complete “package,” including hospitalization, city tours, restaurant dinners, and even boat rides. But the post-op reality isn’t glamorous. Patients spend months recovering, often in wheelchairs, with intensive physical therapy four to five times a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-75334524" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-75334524" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Risks include nerve damage, bone infections, muscle weakness, and nonunion fractures that may never heal properly. Metal rods have weight limits, too, so you need to be under 75 kg (165 lbs) to even qualify.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-are-undergoing-limb-shortening-surgery-just-for-love"&gt;Women Are Undergoing Limb-Shortening Surgery Just for Love&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15025475/Women-flying-Turkey-brutal-LEG-SHORTENING-operations-make-petite.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one Istanbul clinic has done at least 10 cosmetic limb-shortening surgeries since 2023. And while no global registry tracks these procedures yet, forums and Reddit threads have started filling up with stories from tall women who say they’ve struggled to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-37845057" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-37845057" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTE5IGFpLWxpc3QtYmxvY2staXAnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgoKPGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nYWktZHluYW1pYyBhaS1pcC1kYXRhJyAgY291bnRyaWVzPSdLUicgY291bnRyeS1saXN0PSdXJyBkYXRhLWNvZGU9J1BHUnBkaUJqYkdGemN6MG5iRzVuZEdRdFpIbHVZVzFwWXkxcGJtRnlkR2xqYkdVbklITjBlV3hsUFNKdGFXNHRhR1ZwWjJoME9qTXdNSEI0T3lCaGJHbG5iaTFwZEdWdGN6b2dZMlZ1ZEdWeU95QnFkWE4wYVdaNUxXTnZiblJsYm5RNklHTmxiblJsY2pzZ1pHbHpjR3hoZVRvZ1pteGxlRHNpUGp3dlpHbDJQZz09Jz48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One reason? Height politics. Studies show that most men prefer women shorter than themselves, and women tend to prefer taller partners. That leaves some taller women caught in between, and apparently willing to sacrifice inches to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the absurdity of breaking your legs to be shorter, height has been directly connected to health. &lt;a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/07/21/height-and-cancer-risk-the-long-and-short-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Researchers have linked&lt;/a&gt; tall stature in women to conditions like endometriosis and increased cancer risk. But that’s not what’s driving this particular trend. For many, it circles back to dating and the belief that being smaller may make them more “approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-18349350" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-18349350" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s a complicated equation. Shrinking yourself to feel seen by someone else seems a bit over the top. &lt;/p&gt;

The disease causes muscle degeneration and weakness due to a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle fibers from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease, which mostly affects boys, gets worse over time. It makes it difficult to walk, run, jump, and play, with children often delayed in reaching milestones like crawling, walking and talking. The boys will likely use wheelchairs when they are teenagers, and life expectancy ranges between 30 and 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bVpsol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Hunter, 10, (left) and brother Noah, 9, (right) were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017.

Noah received pioneering gene therapy in March this year, which has significantly helped his mobility, his parents said. But Hunter’s insurance claim for the same treatment was denied.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Noah received &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/fda-ap-washington-patients-pfizer-b2362590.html"&gt;pioneering gene therapy &lt;/a&gt;to improve his mobility and quality of life through Alison’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/patients-health-insurance-employees-people-mercer-b2813474.html"&gt;health insurance plan&lt;/a&gt;. But when Hunter’s application was submitted in late May, authorization for exactly the same treatment was denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason on our denial letters is that it's not medically necessary,” the mom-of-three said from her home in Winnetka, just outside Chicago. “It was very blindsiding. They didn't ever deny my other son, it was approved the first go. So I was very taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison, a physician, and her husband William, who works in finance, are now grappling with how to move forward following the decision from health insurance giant, Blue Cross Blue Shield. They say they have been put in an impossible and “heartbreaking” situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;contacted Blue Cross Blue Shield for comment, and asked why the treatment was only covered for Noah when both boys have the same disease. &lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;also asked the company whether it would reconsider the denial in Hunter’s case and to respond to accusations that the decision was “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To protect our member’s privacy, we do not publicly discuss individual cases,” a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson said. “We do want our members to know that medical experts, including doctors, are involved in reviews to ensure the treatments and services our members receive are evidence-based and not duplicative. Decisions are guided by nationwide best practices for care, helping to identify what has proven successful for members in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every passing day, Hunter’s condition gets worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His muscle is wasting away every day,” Alison, 44, said. “He's going to be in a wheelchair in the next few years and it just doesn't seem right that they are not going to allow him to get this treatment. They're wasting his time. And it’s just not fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brothers were diagnosed with DND in 2017 after tests showed Hunter had elevated liver enzymes, which is indicative of the condition. Three months later, when further tests showed the levels had not returned to normal, a specialist delivered the devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DND is a genetic disorder and so Noah and 12-year-old brother Carter were tested following Hunter’s diagnosis. Carter did not have the disease, but Noah’s results came back positive. It was a triple blow for Alison, who not only had to process the fact that two of her children had the life-limiting illness but that she was a carrier of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents and their eldest son Carter have had to go through the pain of witnessing Hunter and Noah gradually decline over the years, as DND has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2023, there was a glimmer of hope when the gene therapy, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.parentprojectmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ELEVIDYS-FAQ-for-community.pdf"&gt;Elevidys&lt;/a&gt;, manufactured by Sarepta Therapeutics, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ethnCd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Alison and husband William, pictured with their boys Hunter, Noah and Carter.

Both of the younger boys were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017, which has no cure&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new treatment, which comes with a $3.2 million price tag, helps improve muscle function and motor skills. So far, over 900 patients have had the treatment, the company says, but given how novel the medicine is, critics say there is limited evidence that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors are cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these newer gene transfer therapies are opening doors for these boys to possibly live longer and lead a good quality of life,” said Dr Aravindhan Veerapandiyan of Arkansas Children’s Hospital. “It’s changing the trajectory of the disease, changing the trajectory of their lives, improving the quality of life for the boys and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevidys is not without controversy. It was approved by the FDA in 2023 but limited to children between 4 and 5 years old, who are able to walk. In 2024, the treatment was expanded to include patients 4 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Public Citizen, a nonprofit which acts an ethics watchdog for clinical trials, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.citizen.org/article/failed-trials-yet-full-fda-approval-of-a-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-gene-therapy/"&gt;said the FDA approval was “ill-advised”&lt;/a&gt; because it was “not supported by favorable FDA scientific reviews”. Nor did clinical trials demonstrate that children with the disease “maintained or regained gross motor abilities”, the group added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was heightened concern in July when the FDA told Sarepta to suspend distribution of the drug while the agency investigated the death of an 8-year-old boy. The FDA subsequently concluded the death was “unrelated to the gene therapy product itself” but the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-recommends-removal-voluntary-hold-elevidys-ambulatory-patients"&gt;agency has still recommended the company pause&lt;/a&gt; distribution of the drug in patients who cannot walk. However, this doesn’t apply to Noah or Hunter, who can both still walk and play with their older brother, Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alison and William, Elevidys was worth trying. “We had very serious conversations with our doctors, but we also know the natural progression of the disease,” Alison said. “So we were willing to take that risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.archildrens.org/blog/revolutionary-gene-therapies"&gt;Arkansas Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Little Rock, his parents said. Elevidys was administered as a one-time infusion.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“End of day fatigue and leg pain was something that he complained of frequently, and he has not complained of it once since getting gene therapy,” Alison said. “He learned how to swim this summer. His overall endurance is so much better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, meanwhile, continues to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people now will say,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Oh my gosh, Noah's doing so well… We can't believe he's swimming, he's this, he's that,” Alison said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;And, I'm like, Oh my gosh, please don't let Hunter hear… because I know that he's thinking that he's not able to do those things. And it's just heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Noah’s treatment was given the green light by the insurance company, both boys underwent their routine, annual cardiac MRIs to take a closer look at their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bLBZUf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock, his parents said.

Therefore, the family decided that Noah should have the treatment first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We collectively made a decision that the safest thing to do is give it to his brother,” Alison explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company gave the green light for Noah’s treatment on November 1, 2024, and he received it a few months later in March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Noah’s treatment went well, doctors, including cardiologists, then gave their approval in April for Hunter to have the same treatment. BCBS denied coverage for the treatment in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited that they gave us the green light. It was like, Oh my gosh, let's go. Let's do it,” Alison recalled. “We told Hunter, ‘It’s your turn,’ never expecting the insurance to say no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom asked: “I mean, how could they say no to him when they already said yes to his brother and he successfully had it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after digging through health insurance paperwork, Alison and William claim that after Noah received approval from BCBS in November 2024 for Elevidys, the insurance firm “quietly” updated company policy on January 1, 2025 to exclude the children’s specific DND mutation from coverage for the gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think it's coincidence,” Alison said. “I think that they knew that we had another child and we were going to be seeking this out [again.]” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company did not address the allegation when&lt;em&gt; The Independent&lt;/em&gt; contacted them for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents are running out of options to get their son the life-improving treatment unless BCBS reconsiders the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have appealed the decision with the insurance giant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple has also contacted representatives in Arkansas, where Hunter would receive the gene therapy treatment, and in their home state of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas state representatives Andrew Collins and Tippi McCullough both offered the family assistance, while Arkansas U.S. Senator Tom Cotton supported the family in reaching out to the federal Office of Personnel Management, Alison said. The parents have also consulted with a lawyer to weigh their options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am starting to feel helpless,” said Alison. “I feel like we have tried to make the best decisions for them all these years, and now the choice has been taken away from us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is not on Hunter’s side and the gene therapy is his best chance of having the most comfortable life possible, his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the age when the boys really do start to decline pretty quickly,” said Alison. “We have seen a significant decline in him in the last few months, which is just so scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapy can stop the disease’s progression. We are just watching him decline before our eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 12:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQbVVUTE1Xd2lCUXhjRktNckNSYVh1Wk8wbjVMMFU0ZFBLMndQdVduMHM3SGphSHV4Z0ZTMUlDbURQZVJfMmZQM2tKUm9UQXEyME8tSlUtQjlRc3JKcG9kQlhkNl9PNTczSURhZW1pYjkxRjBNdE1ONzBsakdCcmZjNkNrNjYtRVZwVnJMVUQ1X3U0X3R4S0dZRkVPZGlScWdiakZlZ0ZB</guid></item><item><title>诉讼称患者在CT扫描延迟超过10小时后死亡- San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/07/lawsuit-alleges-patient-died-after-more-than-10-hour-delay-in-getting-ct-scan/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A civil lawsuit against Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center alleges that a doctor’s order for a patient’s immediate chest X-ray was delayed for more than 10 hours, contributing to his death from a pulmonary embolism — a major blood clot that blocked the arteries of his lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the details of the case are particular to one individual, experts say the outcome is far too common, illustrating the need for greater vigilance of, and advocacy around, a threat that kills a person e&lt;/span&gt;very six minutes, &lt;a href="https://www.stoptheclot.org/blood-clot-information/blood-clots-in-the-united-states/"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the National Blood Clot Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6344107/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the risk of clots forming, especially in the deep veins of the legs, increases with the length of a hospital stay. Even short periods of convalescence, from one to three days, increase the likelihood of a condition called deep venous thrombosis, which can cause clots to break loose in the extremities and travel through the bloodstream, passing through the heart and lodging in the lungs. And this elevated risk continues even after patients are discharged home, making the need for ongoing preventive measures critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Andrew Gabor, this ramp of elevated risk started in Denver during a hospital stay to treat a significant infection. Medical records provided for review by his sister, Maria Healey, show that the 38-year-old man, who was working two jobs, had type 2 diabetes, which contributed to the infection, causing a difficult recovery. Determined to ease her brother’s path, Healey brought him to live with her and her family in Chula Vista, a move that allowed Gabor to continue working remotely in order to keep his health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being the oldest sister, I just felt that need and desire to take care of him as the youngest brother,” Healey said. “Our mom wasn’t able to do it because she has MS, and so I offered to take him home, and he agreed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his convalescence that Gabor began to experience extreme back pain that seemed to be triggered by sitting wrong on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the course of two or three days, he just couldn’t get comfortable, and he was brought to the point of tears because he was in so much pain, and we finally decided he needed to go to the ER,” Healey said. “He also started feeling this numbness in his leg that was driving him crazy because he couldn’t walk anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed that a very large herniated disc and narrowing of the spine were causing the back pain. Sharp Chula Vista admitted Gabor on Feb. 16, 2024, and he underwent spinal decompression and fusion surgery six days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back brace in place, Gabor began physical therapy after the surgery, still spending most of his time in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the surgery, Healey said she received a call from her brother early in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was just really alarmed, almost in tears … he said … I’m just worried I might have had a heart attack, I’m not really sure what’s happening, maybe I’m having a panic attack or anxiety attack,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She arrived not long after to learn that her brother had experienced severe chest pain when attempting to get up to use the bathroom. His heart was racing, his breathing distressed. Required to leave by 8:30 p.m. due to the end of visiting hours, Healey said she returned the following day and was disheartened to see that her brother’s affect had considerably worsened, his skin taking on a gray pallor. He died shortly thereafter, on March 4, 2024, his death certificate later listing the main cause as a bilateral pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Healey said she had many concerns about the care her brother received during his stay, from the &lt;span&gt;lack of &lt;/span&gt;responsiveness of some members of the nursing staff to the fact that he was not transferred to the hospital’s intensive care unit when the chest pain started. But she said she was flabbergasted when she received the results of a state investigation by the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The report came almost an entire year after he died and, when I got it, I was shaking as I read through the papers,” Healey said. “I just couldn’t believe what they had found, and I felt vindicated that he shouldn’t have died, that I was right that something had happened, that this shouldn’t have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the state’s investigative report, based on multiple interviews and reviews of medical records, says that a CT angiography of Gabor’s chest “was completed 12 hours after it was ordered,”&lt;span&gt; a slightly more precise estimate than the lawsuit cites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investigators report that hospital policies do not explicitly define the meaning of the term STAT, investigators say in their write-up that a subsequent interview with an X-ray technician said that staff “knew it was supposed to be completed ‘right away.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interview with a hospital physician also “stated that the expectation was for a STAT order to be completed within one hour … or there was no point (in) ordering (it to be completed) STAT.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was very angry, very very upset, because, as his older sister, I felt like I was there to protect him, and I wasn’t able to do that,” Healey said. “I was told he was in the best place, that he would be given the best care possible, and it just wasn’t the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on behalf of her brother and of her mother, for whom she serves as a guardian, she sued Sharp in San Diego Superior Court on July 11, alleging wrongful death, abuse, neglect and negligence. The suit, served on Sharp last week, seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages and reimbursement for attorney’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp declined to comment on these allegations, indicating in an email that it does not comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the report, and also her brother’s death certificate, sent her to the Internet looking for answers, where she found &lt;a href="https://www.stoptheclot.org/"&gt;stoptheclot.org&lt;/a&gt;, the website of the National Blood Clot Alliance. There she learned that blood clots are estimated to kill between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans per year, which the organization says “is greater than the total number of people who lose their lives each year to AIDS, breast cancer and motor vehicle crashes combined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also found that the organization had created its own acronym to help patients and their loved ones remember the signs and symptoms of imminent blood clot danger. S stands for swelling in the leg, T for tenderness and leg cramps, O for being out of breath, P for passing out, C for chest pain, L for leg discoloration, O for an overdriven heartbeat and T for time to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He fit so many of these that it’s just outrageous,” Healey said. “I wish I had known this ahead of time, and I wish that more people knew just how dangerous and fast this can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rushad Patel, an oncologist with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard University Medical School in Boston, reviewed Gabor’s death certificate and an excerpt from his medical record that outlined his condition, said that deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was likely the cause of the blood clot in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A patient admitted with leg pain who later develops a fatal (pulmonary embolism) was likely experiencing a DVT that then migrated to the lungs,” Patel, also a member of the clot alliance, said in an email. “If the clot is large enough, it can severely affect the function of the heart and prevent proper oxygenation of the blood, which, if severe, can be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventive action, he added, is always the first order of business: “Hospitals are expected to assess every admitted patient for their risk of developing clots. For higher-risk patients, prevention can include medications, mechanical devices as well as early mobility. Medications include small doses of anticoagulants (such as heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Getting patients out of bed and walking as soon as it’s safe can keep the blood flowing and prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some patients who cannot move or have more limited mobility, external devices or compression stockings can help prevent clots as well. These measures, especially the use of anticoagulants, have to be balanced against bleeding risk. For example, if a patient has recently had surgery or bleeding complications, medications may not be safe, and the team will rely more on mechanical devices and mobility. The important principle is that clot prevention should always be actively considered and tailored to the individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family members, he added, should feel empowered to ask if their loved one has been assessed for blood clot risk and what steps are in place to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If medications are not being used, it’s reasonable to ask why — sometimes the answer is a high bleeding risk,” Patel said. “They can also look for practical signs: Are compression boots being used? Is the patient encouraged to walk or do leg exercises? Is the care team attentive to symptoms like swelling, redness, or pain in the legs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, family members and patients themselves can act as advocates by making sure prevention is on the radar. Knowing one’s risk factors and asking the questions signals to the care team that clot prevention matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabor’s medical records do indicate that he received “DVT prophylaxis” during his stay at the hospital, and Healey said she does remember him being given compression socks for his legs, though their purpose, she said, was not communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was very unexplained what they were for,” she said. “They were these Velcro cuffs to put on, and he wasn’t told why he should use them; he was just told that they were there if he wanted to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that a risk assessment is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t recall AJ ever having a risk assessment done when he was first admitted to the hospital, and I haven’t found proof that one was done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

A blocked artery also means that the supply of blood is disturbed, and in turn causes the organs to receive less oxygen. So the threat is not just to your heart but to other organs as well, like the brain with a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/07/550x309/heart_attack_1757242574904_1757242575065.jpg" alt="Fit and sporty individuals can suffer heart attacks or sudden cardiac arrests due to various reasons.

Addressing this, Cardiologist Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, who often shares insights on how to keep the heart healthy, revealed in an August 4 Instagram post about how one can keep their artery healthy without medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-reveals-1-daily-habit-that-is-putting-young-healthy-people-in-20s-30s-suddenly-in-heart-failure-attack-101757213135869.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Cardiologist reveals 1 daily habit that's putting 'young, healthy people in their 20s and 30s suddenly in heart failure'"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiologist reveals 1 daily habit that's putting 'young, healthy people in their 20s and 30s suddenly in heart failure'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, after two decades as a functional cardiologist, shared in his post four personal observations on what helps keep heart arteries flexible and resilient. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained, “None of this is flashy. But when applied consistently, it’s the real ‘bulletproofing’ strategy for your heart and your future.” So this means that a healthy heart comes from daily habits which are consistent, not your quick fixes promising unrealistic things. And preventive measures early on help to safeguard your heart in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the four things he shared, and how they help:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Builds muscle that stabilises blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowers blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Prioritising omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat fatty fish, walnuts, and chia seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They help reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Consistent sleep rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowers cortisol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protects vessel lining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Managing stress intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathwork, meditation, or even daily walks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They support your nervous system and your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

Not only is it one of your body’s main sources of energy, but it also helps repair muscles, regulate digestion and more. It’s a hot topic, but what many people don’t realize is, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; is just as important. Yet more than 90% of adults in the U.S. aren't meeting their recommended daily fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This five-day high-protein, high-fiber meal plan makes it easier to get both. Each day is set at 1,800 calories, with simple swaps for 1,500 or 2,000 calories, and provides ample protein and fiber for satisfying meals made with everyday ingredients.

This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

The breakfasts range from 332 to 478 calories, while the lunches span 379 to 596 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits of a High-Protein, High-Fiber Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is found in every cell in our body. Because of this, it’s essential for countless bodily functions like bone and muscle health, digestion and energy production. While most people get enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-protein-11790921" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, certain factors like activity level, age or health goals may amp up your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, diets that are too high in protein can sometimes lack fiber, which may lead to digestive troubles. Striking the right balance of both protein and fiber is key to keeping your body healthy and running smoothly. Fiber brings its own powerful set of benefits. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to healthier weight loss and long-term weight control, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, reduced odds of certain cancers, more regular bowel movements and even a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, protein and fiber help you feel full and satisfied after meals, support digestion and keep your energy steady throughout the day. Talk about a winning combo for health and well-being!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How We Create Meal Plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-11803586" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 11:45:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFAyUHlINkV4UER6UDJETnJJSTlVVVRNUUVWMDRSSUx1SEc2RDNVbGM4X2ZaZ3VuNEVLalJwaFdZSVJ1VnV5TXg3cmVSSlc0VE0wRlVxSVh1UURncXNBd2xRU0Z3WFBrMlBQd3c</guid></item></channel></rss>
