(WKRC) — An outbreak of Giardia has begun to migrate across Kentucky, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1131293932362885&amp;amp;set=pcb.1131295782362700" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1131293932362885&amp;amp;set=pcb.1131295782362700" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;A statement issued by Kentucky Public Health Monday states&lt;/a&gt; that officials are investigating a Giardia outbreak in Western Kentucky, with Hopkins County being the primary area affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of July 21, 2025, there have been 66 laboratory-confirmed cases of Giardia reported across Hopkins, Muhlenberg and Webster Counties since May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact sources of the infection remain unidentified, numerous cases have been linked to dining at El Tapatio Mexican Cantina in Madisonville, Kentucky. The restaurant has been cooperating fully with health officials as the investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are conducting environmental sampling to pinpoint potential sources of Giardia exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giardia is a parasite commonly found in untreated waters, such as streams, rivers, and lakes, and can spread through contaminated water, food, or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of Giardia typically appear one to three weeks after exposure and can include diarrhea, gas, stomach pain and fatigue. These symptoms can last for weeks. Young children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for complications, including dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends prompt diagnosis, maintaining good hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting home environments and child care facilities and monitoring water quality in private wells to prevent and control Giardia outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kentucky, approximately 100 to 300 cases of Giardia are reported annually, with a higher frequency during summer and early fall. The parasite is often linked to recreational water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and swimming pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials advise those concerned about potential Giardia infection to consult their healthcare provider for testing or treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 10:27:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>救命！我儿子刚刚放弃了捐精的消息。这给了我一个绝妙的想法。- Slate杂志 | Help!

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd98pcy2000o3b77vpu1kogn@published"&gt;A week ago, I learned that my 35-year-old son donated sperm to a lesbian couple he’s friends with, and they just had a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9lf9ts00073b77nppammj6@published"&gt;He’s not married and has expressed no interest in having children, so this came as a complete shock. My son is an only child, and I have been lamenting the prospect of never having grandchildren. Would it be acceptable if I approached this couple to ask if I can be in my granddaughter’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="183" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd98pd4h000r3b77m22ng701@published"&gt;You can reach out if, and &lt;em&gt;only if&lt;/em&gt;, you ask your son to ask the moms if they’re interested in connecting with you as a bonus grandma, and they say yes. They might agree. And if they do, this could work out really well. Almost all parents would benefit from having more loving adults in their lives who are willing to be there for their children. But if the three of you do decide you’ll be a part of the kid’s life, you should work hard to clarify expectations about your role. You should be very careful not to suggest that you have some kind of authority over the child because of your biological connection. There are other things to iron out, too: What will you be called? How much do they think they might be in touch with you? Are they open to advice on feeding, sleep, and milestones? Are you going to be visiting when it works for you and enjoying the fun parts of caring for a baby, or showing up as needed and helping out with the hard parts?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd98pd6h000s3b77wnc9k2so@published"&gt;That’s all &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;they’re interested, which is a very big if. Be prepared for the answer to be, “No thanks.” If that’s the case, knowing that there is a child out there who is part of your bloodline and whom you don’t know could be painful, especially because you’d really like to have a grandchild. So have a plan for how you’ll manage those feelings, to best take care of yourself, but also to avoid behaving in a way that causes a rift with your son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd98pd8l000t3b7775om521v@published"&gt;If it’s not in the cards for you to be a grandmother to this particular child, there are other options. Check out one of the groups dedicated to connecting families without local grandparents to people who would like to fill that role (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SurrogateGrandparentsNorthAmerica/"&gt;here’s one&lt;/a&gt;). Or volunteer with children. Don’t let your son’s choice not to have kids keep you from sharing the nurturing energy you have to give. You could find a really fulfilling relationship with a child who makes you forget that you’re not biologically related.&lt;/p&gt;

Think about whether working to deepen your relationship with him might be comforting in some way. I’m sure that when you were raising him, you were often prioritizing the tasks you needed to complete to get through the day. In this era, you can slow down and really enjoy him and his adult personality. I’m struck by the fact that he didn’t tell you about donating sperm until after the birth. That makes me think there’s room for you to express more curiosity about his life, show that you’re a supportive person to talk to, and even have some fun together. While hanging out with an adult son is not going to scratch the same itch as cuddling an adorable baby, it might provide some joy that you didn’t know you were &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal study of nearly 996 healthy adults found that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated ageing of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting paper, "Accelerated brain ageing during the COVID-19 pandemic," &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal Nature Communications on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper explains that the UK's Biobank contains longitudinal neuroimaging data describing the brains of over 15,000 Brits, and that scientists have used machine learning and those records to create a brain age prediction model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plausible explanation is chronic stress, social isolation, economic insecurity, and health concerns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Nottingham researchers who led the study captured MRI images of 996 people who lived through COVID, applied the model, and estimated each person's "brain age" — how old their brain appeared to be compared to their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found "the pandemic significantly accelerates brain ageing" by an average of 5.5 months. Even those who didn't catch the virus endured the same outcome. The researchers found more pronounced ageing in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

    

&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't sure why subjects' brains aged so fast during the pandemic but suggest "A plausible explanation … is chronic stress, potentially linked to pandemic-related factors such as social isolation, economic insecurity, and health concerns." The paper also notes previous studies that found social isolation and perceived loneliness change the brain in ways felt to drive accelerated brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

        


        

&lt;p&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," said Dorothee Auer, Professor of Neuroimaging and senior author on the study. "The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage. We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While brains appear to have aged more quickly during the pandemic, the study found only participants who were infected by COVID-19 between their brain scans showed a drop in certain cognitive abilities, such as mental flexibility and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that the pandemic’s brain ageing effect, on its own (without infection) may not cause symptoms," states the University of Nottingham's summary of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the need to address health and socio-economic inequalities in addition to lifestyle factors to mitigate accelerated brain ageing," the paper concludes. "Continued research and targeted policies are crucial to improve brain health outcomes in future public health crises." ®&lt;/p&gt;                                
                    &lt;/div&gt;

A recent study has discovered a correlation between consuming one egg per week and a 47% decrease in the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was observed when compared to individuals who ate eggs less than once a month. The study also revealed that regular egg consumption was associated with a lower accumulation of toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to mention that some authors of the study, published in &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662400289X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, received funding from the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.incredibleegg.org/about-us/egg-nutrition-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Egg Nutrition Center&lt;/a&gt; based in the US. Alzheimer's disease is globally the most prevalent form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cited by &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eating-1-egg-per-week-linked-to-lower-alzheimers-risk-study-finds#Eggs-and-Alzheimer-s-What-is-the-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, the study analysed data from 1,024 elderly adults with an average age of 81.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent annual health check-ups, filled out food frequency questionnaires, and were monitored by researchers for an average duration of 6.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over this time frame, just over a quarter of them were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of this data indicated that those who consumed at least one egg per week had a 47% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's during the follow-up period compared to those consuming one egg per month or fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same study, post-mortem examinations of the brains of 578 participants showed that those who consumed one or more eggs each week were likely to have less protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choline and omega-3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the cognitive-enhancing properties of eggs are attributed to two key nutrients, choline and omega-3. Prior research has highlighted the crucial role of choline in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers elaborated that "choline modulates the expression of key genes related to memory, learning, and cognitive functions via epigenetic mechanisms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also identified eggs as a "top food source" for choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, eggs boast a high content of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to bolster brain health as we grow older. The study's authors proposed that the combined presence of choline and omega-3s in eggs could have a "synergistic" impact, enhancing their protective effect on brain health through the ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have indicated that individuals with Alzheimer's disease tend to have lower levels of omega-3s and choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team of researchers concluded that more research is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stated: "Once replicated in other prospective cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials, these findings may have important public health implications for reducing the population's risk of [Alzheimer's]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 05:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOemJmZVFtVmtTczQ4NWlzX0pxTVlvaHBnSm9pT0NKaXlpbHA5bHJnZlRxem8tOFNjcFFXVXJyaW1nLUpkaVZZUEhodHBRQ21LZzJWeU1pcVMydTE1dEdFaFZJU3VmR0xDQUh5RVUxME9sUGZBa2lBRm5qbDNSMXhwX19MVm1pb09ONGfSAY8BQVVfeXFMUGdXdW1wZnpLLUtmekZhYXBMRUVPa0I0NDVXd0xiSFppVFhzU0RJbU1ORjZIQ0pfc0pvdWdDN3ZOR0FUOGxhMlR3QXJqT2NMaEVhU1AxNE9zODViMjF1cWZrbjlJS3l1V1VtZElzTXQ2SWp2N2wyNWlScUZ4QjhqXzZZQzhTamNKbWdlUkJDemM</guid></item><item><title>由于邻里癌症激增而遭受破坏的家庭可追溯到第一颗原子弹产生的放射性废物-每日邮报 | Families devastated as neighborhood cancer surge is traced to radioactive waste from first atomic bomb - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A chilling new study has confirmed the fears of generations - that children who grew up near a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-30093960-6779-11f0-8c8d-27754c6a0193"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; creek polluted by nuclear waste from the first atomic bomb project are suffering from elevated rates of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-30040940-6779-11f0-8c8d-27754c6a0193"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings have been published this week in JAMA Network Open by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and provide the clearest evidence to date linking radioactive contamination in Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River north of St. Louis, to long-term cancer risks in nearby residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research indicates that the communities around North St. Louis appear to have had excess cancer from exposure to the contaminated Coldwater Creek,' said Marc Weisskopf, professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at Harvard and corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weisskopf's team found that individuals who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children between the 1940s and 1960s were significantly more likely to develop cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe the cancer is a result of ionizing radiation exposure from the creekbed, soil, and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source of the contamination dates back to one of the darkest and most secretive chapters in US history: the Manhattan Project, the clandestine federal initiative that developed the world's first &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nuclear-weapons/index.html" id="mol-30067a40-6779-11f0-8c8d-27754c6a0193"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, operating in downtown St. Louis, was responsible for processing uranium used in the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the war, barrels of radioactive waste were moved to open-air storage sites near Coldwater Creek, where they remained for years, exposed to rain, wind, and runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Generations of families played in Coldwater Creek which has resulted in thousands of people developing life-threatening cancers and other illnesses Pictured: A 1980s picture of a boy using a rope swing to jump into Coldwater Creek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The radioactive waste from the plant was kept for years in barrels next to Coldwater Creek.

St. Louis activists have been fighting for years to get government compensation for people with cancer and other serious illnesses potentially connected to Manhattan Project nuclear contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope these findings will support public health measures for affected communities, as well as ongoing efforts to remediate the creek,' Leung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nuclear workers had direct exposure, people who live near contamination sites worry about uncertainty. Many who grew up in the area weren't told about the risks for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2007, Chapman and Karen Nickel were so concerned about cancer and other unusual illnesses in their St. Louis County neighborhoods that they formed Just Moms STL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry issued a report that found people who regularly played in Coldwater Creek as children from the 1960s to the 1990s may have a slight increased risk of bone cancer, lung cancer and leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency determined that those exposed daily to the creek starting in the 2000s, when cleanup began, could have a small increased risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government's sloppy handling of nuclear contamination over decades has understandably made people doubt official promises that conditions are safe now, said Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear expert and president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is zero trust,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;Susie Gaffney poses for a photo along Coldwater Creek near where she used to live. The creek was contaminated when nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project flowed into the waterway.

Gaffney, now in his 60s, grew up in the 1960s playing in Coldwater Creek. His childhood home backed onto it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2007, Karen Nickel, left, and Dawn Chapman were so concerned about cancer and other unusual illnesses in their St. Louis County neighborhoods that they formed Just Moms STL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People in the St. Louis area are concerned that more illnesses are caused by the contamination and some are pushing for legislation to compensate those who are sick. Others have sued those responsible for the waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several people with serious illnesses, or whose loved ones are sick, met recently at Nickel's house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jim Gaffney, now in his 60s, grew up in the 1960s playing in Coldwater Creek - his childhood home backed up to the waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was always in the creek,' Gaffney said. 'Told not to, but we had seven kids. Mom couldn't watch us all. We just thought it was fun. We built mudslides and everything. I'm sure I got exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He and his wife, Susie, loved the neighborhood so much that when they got married, they moved into a home there. Their children grew up playing in a park that backs to the creek, Susie Gaffney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had no warnings. We had no fears,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jim Gaffney was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma in 1981 and given little chance to survive. A bone-marrow transplant saved his life, but the toll of the radiation, chemotherapy and the disease has been enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo spoke about  the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington last September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;A member of the Navajo Nation holds holds a banner during a news conference about the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act on Capitol Hill in Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A duck is seen swimming in the Coldwater Creek in Florissant, Missouri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now I've got hypertension, heart failure, I've had at least five bladder tumors removed since ´95.

My blood pressure and cholesterol levels have always been very good, and there's no history of heart issues in my immediate family. At my last checkup, my total cholesterol was 178 mg/dL; my LDL was 81 mg/dL; my triglycerides were 61 (all a bit high for me); and my HDL was 87 mg/dL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When reviewing these numbers, I noticed that some research suggests that an HDL over 80mg/dL is too high and can possibly lead to heart or stroke issues down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Can you comment on what is "too high" of an HDL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— E.P.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear E.P.:&lt;/strong&gt; Low levels of HDL cholesterol are known to be associated with a higher risk for heart attacks, while high levels of HDL are generally protective. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In some people with a strong family of heart disease and high HDL cholesterol levels, the HDL particles were found to be different from normal HDL particles and weren't protective against inflammation in a cell culture. For this reason, I look at family history as a very important risk factor, which is not taken into account by most of the scoring systems that allow doctors to estimate heart disease risk. (Interestingly, the use of a statin drug helped the abnormal HDL particles work more effectively.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Diabetics who are on insulin often have high HDL levels, which cannot be considered protective. There is also an unusual type of HDL particle found in an Italian village called ApoA-1 Milano that is highly protective against heart disease, even with low HDL levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I suspect that in the future, we will be looking at function (instead of just levels of cholesterol types and related proteins) to predict heart disease and determine who would benefit from medication. For right now, a scoring system such as PREVENT (tinyurl.com/PREVENTCalc), modified by family history, remains the best place for most people to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with a strong family history and normal or low cholesterol levels should consider additional testing, such as Lp(a), a lipoprotein that predicts heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; What is your opinion on the new Galleri blood test that can help detect cancers for which there are no early screening? Like many people my age (66), I've known too many people who have died of pancreatic cancer that was caught too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Anon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Anon.:&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, the test isn't this helpful yet. It's a very good test, but screening for a rare disease is limited by the fact that many people need to be screened to find even one case. The test would have to be near-perfect for it to be useful, and the current version of cell-free DNA testing isn't quite there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The sensitivity of the test is about 30%, meaning that it will miss more than two-thirds of people with pancreatic cancer. Most people would assume that a negative test means they don't have the disease, but this isn't exactly true. It's possible that the false sense of security could keep a person from mentioning early symptoms to their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The main problem is when the test result is positive. A person who receives the devastating news that their test is positive for pancreatic cancer as part of a screening might be surprised to learn that only 2.2% of positive tests indicate pancreas cancer. Nonetheless, they are likely to require additional, expensive, anxiety-provoking and possibly invasive tests to conclude that the test was a false positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Due to the poor sensitivity and low positive predictive value of the test, I am not recommending it.

The good news is that it’s reversible. &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/sweet-danger-soda-found-to-alter-your-gut-and-immune-health/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Israel News Network Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption of soft drinks, supplemented with white sugar, alters the DNA of gut bacteria and affects the host immune system, according to the findings of a new study published in the journal Nature Communications by researchers at the Technion Institute in Haifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? The effects are reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut bacteria are important members of the microbial community within our body, i.e., the microbiome. These bacteria, which have co-evolved with humans for generations, are so essential to human health in general and to the development of the immune system in particular that we cannot function without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human gut is constantly influenced by changes in the environment. To keep up, the gut bacteria must adapt quickly. They do this through a process called functional plasticity, which allows them to change their behavior and functions in response to factors like nearby microbes, our health status, and what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous study by Professor &lt;strong&gt;Naama Geva-Zatorsky&lt;/strong&gt; and her team discovered that one way gut bacteria adapt to environmental changes is through DNA inversions—rapid genetic switches that help them respond and defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their current study, the researchers investigated how these DNA inversions occur in response to dietary factors. They found that consuming soft drinks, which contain white sugar, can alter the DNA of gut bacteria and, in turn, impact the host’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied the effects of consuming different dietary components on the DNA inversion profile of these bacteria, in vitro, in mice, and humans. They discovered that white sugar consumption causes DNA inversions in these bacteria, which led to changes in inflammatory markers of the immune system, including ones in T-cell populations, cytokine secretion, and gut permeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these effects are reversible; once mice stopped consuming white sugar, the bacterial DNA inversion state reverted, and the immune system’s state returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — Prisma Richland Children’s Hospital in Columbia has confirmed that a patient treated at their facility has died from a brain-eating amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the South Carolina Department of Health, they believe the patient was exposed to the rare, but deadly, organism at Lake Murray.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents in the area are voicing concern following the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does concern me a little bit because I don't know what would happen if we did catch it,” Haylie Russell said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other residents who visit the lake often say they try and avoid the water. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's bound to be bugs in there so I don't get in the water and apparently there's been an an outbreak of amoeba and for that reason really I will stay out of the water,” Precious Sibanda said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday night, state health leaders said they suspect the exposure occurred at Lake Murray. Prisma Health Pediatric Infectious Disease Physician Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch confirmed the patient was treated at their Columbia facility.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This amoeba infects the brain and it makes the brain swell. The majority of the cases that have happened in the United States are fatal,” Dr. Burch said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say this type of amoeba is common in warm freshwater across South Carolina, including lakes, rivers, ponds, and other still bodies of water.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's not an issue when we come in contact with it, that being we accidentally drink the water, we accidentally get it on our skin, we're swimming, those kind of things. Where it can cause an issue is if water, forceful water gets up the nose and is able to cross from the nose into the brain,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of infection can include headache, fever, stiff neck, or vomiting. Medical professionals say these symptoms can begin anywhere from one to 12 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's very, very important to let the healthcare provider know that you have had exposure to fresh water. The main reason is because the quicker we can make a diagnosis, the better the outcome could be,” Dr. Burch said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infection, while rare, has a fatality rate of over 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid speculation on social media, doctors are working to dispel myths about how the amoeba is contracted. Dr. Curry, with the Medical University of South Carolina, clarified some of the misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot get this by ingesting, you can drink a whole glass full of water full of amoebas and not get sick from it so it's certainly not gonna spread through consuming any contaminated food. This is not like food poisoning,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the infection is not transmissible from person to person and doesn’t enter through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These infections are all or nothing, so you're not going to get an asymptomatic amoeba infection. You're not going to get a mild case and have a doctor miss it,” Dr. Curry said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Health has not released any additional details about the patient, including their age.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to state health officials, this is the first reported case of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina since 2016. Nationwide, there have only been 167 reported cases over the past 62 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPH reminds the public that this amoeba is naturally present in many warm freshwater lakes, rivers, and streams. To reduce risk, they recommend avoiding situations where water can forcefully enter the nose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
    &lt;/div&gt;

In some cases it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chikungunya is not a disease that is widely known, but it has been detected and transmitted in 119 countries globally, putting 5.6 billion people at risk," said the WHO's Diana Rojas Alvarez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-fatal-disease-x-outbreak-in-congo-still-cant-be-explained?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Mysterious Fatal 'Disease X' Outbreak in Congo Still Can't Be Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled how from 2004 to 2005, a major chikungunya epidemic swept across the Indian Ocean, hitting small island territories before spreading globally and affecting almost half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, WHO is seeing the same pattern emerge: since the beginning of 2025, Reunion, Mayotte, and Mauritius have all reported major chikungunya outbreaks. One-third of the population of Reunion is estimated to have been infected already," she told a press briefing in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Raising the alarm'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue fever and Zika virus disease, making it difficult to diagnose, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya"&gt;according to the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rojas Alvarez said that like 20 years ago, the virus was now spreading to other places in the region, such as Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Epidemic transmission is also occurring in south Asia," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168809" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168809" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/tiger_mosquito_642.jpg" alt="tiger mosquito" class="wp-image-168809 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/tiger_mosquito_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/tiger_mosquito_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168809" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Chikungunya virus is spread by the tiger mosquito.

Local transmission has been reported in France, and suspected cases detected in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because these patterns of transmission were seen in the outbreak from 2004 onwards, WHO is calling for urgent action to prevent history from repeating itself," said Rojas Alvarez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that the case fatality rate was less than one percent, "but when you start counting millions of cases, that one percent can be thousands" of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are raising the alarm early so countries can prepare early, detect and strengthen all the capacities to avoid going through very large outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tiger mosquitos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rojas Alvarez explained that in regions where populations have little or no immunity, the virus can quickly cause significant epidemics, affecting up to three-quarters of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya virus is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female mosquitoes, most commonly &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter, which is known as the tiger mosquito, is venturing farther north as the world warms because of human-driven  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="168806" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They bite primarily during daylight hours, with peak activity often in the early morning and late afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO urged people to protect themselves through measures like using mosquito repellent and not leaving water to stagnate in containers such as buckets, where mosquitoes can breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors have wondered for decades whether that extra body heat is simply coincidence or a clue to something deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new trove of data suggests the two feelings march together far more often than chance would allow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting depression early can save months of struggle, and an everyday thermometer to measure your body temperature might become part of that early-warning kit, according to a fascinating study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-and-body-temperature"&gt;Depression and body temperature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers – led by a team at the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;) and partners in 106 countries – studied seven months of depression scores and body temperature readings from more than 20,000 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second month of analysis, a very clear pattern emerged: higher depression scores meant higher body temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants used household thermometers once a day and wore smart rings that sampled skin temperature thousands of times during each 24-hour cycle. The design captured both single snapshots and continuous streams, giving the study unusual breadth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each notch upward on the depression survey paired with a small rise in temperature – often less than one degree Fahrenheit – but the match held across climates, ages, and seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That consistency lifts the evidence from this study above many previous lab experiments that relied on a few dozen college students at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-a-slight-rise-means"&gt;What a slight rise means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy core hovers near 98.6 °F, yet the body drifts up and down around that mark as metabolism revs or relaxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, people reporting milder symptoms stayed close to the textbook average, while those with heavier moods sat just a hair warmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences averaged less than one degree, and that alone won’t trigger an alarm. But across populations, it points to a biological shift that shadows emotional pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also compared the daily swing – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37640270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diurnal amplitude&lt;/a&gt; – between daytime peaks and nighttime lows. Smaller swings lined up with stronger depression scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend scraped just below statistical significance, yet it matched hints from earlier controlled trials, suggesting timing may matter as much as the absolute reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-nighttime-signal"&gt;The nighttime signal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooler evenings help the brain drift into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-clears-toxic-waste-from-the-brain/"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers who scored high for depression did not shed heat as smoothly after sundown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their temperature curves looked flatter, which may echo trouble in the internal clock that guides hormone release and sleep architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rare-gene-explains-why-some-people-can-thrive-on-less-sleep/"&gt;short sleep&lt;/a&gt; is itself a risk factor for mood disorders, so a sluggish drop in temperature could add weight to an already heavy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian researchers have long noted that light exposure, meal timing, and exercise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/feeling-groggy-a-simple-trick-can-transform-your-mornings/"&gt;reset the clock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work pushes body temperature onto that list, raising the chance that adjusting thermal cues might nudge sleep and mood back into sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-likes-warm-temperatures"&gt;Depression likes warm temperatures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping core temperature in check is a full-time job. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/syncing-brain-muscle-circadian-rhythms-slows-aging/"&gt;Muscles&lt;/a&gt;, the liver, and even the brain churn out heat, while blood flow to the skin and sweating carry it away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079864/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stress hormones&lt;/a&gt;, low-grade inflammation, and shifts in neurotransmitters – all common in depression – can clog sweat glands and narrow tiny blood vessels near the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodermal readings, which track microscopic bursts of sweat, often register on the low end for people with depression, hinting at weaker cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A persistent half-degree rise may feel harmless, but over weeks it tweaks heart rate, muddles energy levels, and chips away at &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-how-slow-waves-boost-memory-formation/"&gt;restorative sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That steady drag can deepen emotional lows, creating a loop in which feeling down slows cooling and inadequate cooling worsens the mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heating-up-to-cool-down"&gt;Heating up to cool down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ironically, heating people up actually can lead to rebound body temperature lowering that lasts longer than simply cooling people down directly, as through an ice bath,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/ashley.mason" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ashley Mason&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, the study’s lead author and associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What if we can track the body temperature of people with depression to time heat-based treatments well?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6310/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Whole-body hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, asks a patient to relax under infrared lamps until core temperature climbs several degrees. A single session in one small trial lifted mood for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunas, hot yoga, and long soaks in a 104 °F tub appear to provoke a similar rebound: the body overshoots on cooling afterward, leaving core temperature slightly lower for hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If timing that surge and crash lines up with individual temperature curves, it could become an affordable add-on to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taming-the-heat"&gt;Taming the heat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to examine the association between body temperature – assessed using both self-report methods and wearable sensors – and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-depression-contagious-couples-may-share-it-through-kissing/"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in a geographically broad sample,” Mason concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the climbing rates of depression in the United States, we’re excited by the possibilities of a new avenue for treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly one-third of patients feel little relief after trying two &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drugs-targeting-gut-cells-not-brain-cells-are-better-at-treating-depression-and-anxiety/"&gt;antidepressant drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and weekly talk therapy remains out of reach for many because of cost or distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thermal protocols demand little gear beyond heaters, benches, or tubs already found in fitness centers. Insurance rarely covers such sessions today, but wider evidence may nudge payers to rethink that stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, consumer wearables have plunged in price, making continuous temperature tracking a realistic self-care tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-temperature-and-the-future-0"&gt;Depression, temperature, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is simple in plan, tricky in practice: deliberately adjust body temperature, then watch mood move in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials will compare saunas, heated vests, and water immersion to learn which triggers the most durable cooling. Researchers will also test whether syncing heat exposure with each person’s unique temperature rhythm improves results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one expects warmth alone to overhaul depression treatment, yet it could offer relief to people who prefer non-drug options or need something to bridge long gaps between counseling visits. Because the approach is low-tech, it might reach rural clinics that struggle to hire mental-health specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, keeping an eye on the thermometer when low mood lingers could provide an early hint that the system is off balance. A small rise, coupled with persistent sadness or fatigue, may be reason enough to talk with a clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51567-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 00:44:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQeWUzcEZPNWhBZHpwQkk4bTJQbER2aHlsa0dIaWFBTU9ZRUgzSklWZDE4d0pqYlN2Q0pDS2xXU3ByS0xiVmxoZmhkWGJaLWJwTjFTYWJJWDFTMFI5TFlNdWFRbUhuTmhXWlFMTlVyRFNCQlI4OGVNbzZjRkJEcm0yNzJoYTJRSEttYnZwallnbw</guid></item><item><title>你可以热爱动物，但仍然吃肉-这就是为什么你的大脑必须屏蔽同理心才能做到这一点- VegOut | You can love animals and still eat meat—here’s why your brain has to block out empathy to do it - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQTGw2elU5bWhHRGFBLXlFZHlzX1RKMEI1azdHR1BEbkFyLTk0aWFiTDBSTlF0R3ZGMFpUM080dFE0YUV6bVBMSmVKbS1jdDNDcEJtN083azl0V0dtY05YMkdDdG55QWJ2NEN3SnZ2UTNidVBUM1huODJyQ202VlhwMkcyaUJnbGd5QzRqWXJLbHRGTDR3R0N6RThsQXk3N3JIUXFySTlHNUc5cF9OOVNYQlgzTTdzMmd6YjAxOTFNVFZRa1pyY2R6TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="716"&gt;It’s a familiar scene: a doting pet parent lovingly feeding their rescue dog a bowl of grain-free kibble—then later that evening, slicing into a filet mignon with equal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="716"&gt;Or the proud “chicken mom” who goes viral for knitting sweaters for her backyard hens…while ordering spicy wings from Uber Eats. These aren’t outliers—they’re all of us, to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="718" data-end="1094"&gt;You can love animals and still eat meat. Most people do. But here’s the kicker: to make that coexistence feel emotionally okay, your brain actually has to step in and silence parts of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="718" data-end="1094"&gt;It’s not hypocrisy so much as psychology. And once you understand what’s going on under the hood—neurologically and culturally—you can start to untangle the behaviors from the beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1096" data-end="1150"&gt;The empathy switch: how your brain mutes discomfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1152" data-end="1469"&gt;Let’s start with the science. According to a 2016 study in &lt;em data-start="1211" data-end="1221"&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;, the brain regions associated with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-rat-empathy-may-reveal-about-human-compassion/?.com"&gt;empathy and moral decision-making&lt;/a&gt;—like the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula—light up when people see animals suffering. But when that animal is labeled “food”? Activity in those areas drops significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1471" data-end="1672"&gt;In other words, when we categorize a cow as “burger” instead of “being,” our brain turns down the emotional volume. Researchers call this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_disengagement?.com"&gt;“moral disengagement,”&lt;/a&gt; and it’s a built-in feature, not a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This psychological distancing isn’t just theoretical—it’s measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;A 2010 fMRI study published in &lt;em data-start="707" data-end="717"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; found that vegetarians and vegans exhibited &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010847&amp;amp;.com"&gt;greater activation in empathy-related brain regions&lt;/a&gt;, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, compared to omnivores when shown images of animal suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This suggests that frequent meat consumption may dull certain neural responses related to empathy, helping reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This doesn’t mean meat-eaters are cruel—it means their brains are doing what they must to avoid daily moral conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2072" data-end="2206"&gt;Think of it like closing a window on a cold night. It doesn’t mean the air isn’t out there. You’ve just made it easier not to feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2208" data-end="2247"&gt;Carnism: the invisible belief system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2249" data-end="2485"&gt;Psychologist Melanie Joy coined the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnism?.com"&gt;“carnism”&lt;/a&gt; to describe the ideology that conditions us to eat certain animals while caring for others. It’s the unspoken rules that say it’s normal to love dogs, protect whales, and barbecue pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2487" data-end="2522"&gt;Carnism operates in three key ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="2524" data-end="2836"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2524" data-end="2615"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="2615"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2527" data-end="2544"&gt;Justification&lt;/strong&gt;: “Humans have always eaten meat,” “It’s natural,” or “It’s necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2616" data-end="2734"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2619" data-end="2734"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2619" data-end="2635"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Animal agriculture is hidden behind euphemisms (“pork” instead of “pig”) and sanitized packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2735" data-end="2836"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2738" data-end="2836"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2738" data-end="2754"&gt;Dissociation&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re trained not to connect the steak to the steer, or the nugget to the chick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2838" data-end="3015"&gt;These mechanisms don’t exist to make us bad people—they help us function in a culture where meat is normalized. But if we start to name them, we can also start to question them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3017" data-end="3067"&gt;The meat paradox: when love collides with habit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3069" data-end="3129"&gt;So what happens when your identity clashes with your dinner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3131" data-end="3335"&gt;Enter “the meat paradox.” That’s the term behavioral scientists use to describe the psychological conflict between caring for animals and eating them. It’s uncomfortable—but it’s also surprisingly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3337" data-end="3671"&gt;A 2020 paper published in &lt;em data-start="3363" data-end="3409"&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; found that the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lauren-Camilleri-3/publication/341408268_The_role_of_moral_disengagement_and_animal_empathy_in_the_meat_paradox/links/6461a47ffbaf5b27a4c9731a/The-role-of-moral-disengagement-and-animal-empathy-in-the-meat-paradox.pdf?.com"&gt;more strongly people identified as animal lovers&lt;/a&gt;, the more mental gymnastics they performed to justify eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3337" data-end="3671"&gt;In fact, these individuals were more likely to endorse myths like “animals don’t really suffer” or “meat is essential for health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3673" data-end="3696"&gt;It’s empathy, detoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3698" data-end="3984"&gt;But here’s where it gets juicy: when people confront the paradox head-on—by watching documentaries, visiting sanctuaries, or simply learning more about animal cognition—many start shifting their behavior. Not always toward full veganism, but toward conscious reduction. And that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3986" data-end="4038"&gt;Why this matters for the planet (and your health)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4040" data-end="4175"&gt;This isn’t just about animals. The meat paradox also masks bigger issues, like climate change, public health, and community resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="4177" data-end="4862"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4177" data-end="4456"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4179" data-end="4456"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4179" data-end="4197"&gt;Climate impact&lt;/strong&gt;: According to the UN’s FAO, animal agriculture accounts for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/family-farming/detail/en/c/1634679/?.com"&gt;14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;—more than all the world’s cars, trucks, and planes combined. Beef alone produces five times the emissions of chicken and twenty times that of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4457" data-end="4701"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4459" data-end="4701"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4459" data-end="4476"&gt;Health impact&lt;/strong&gt;: The World Health Organization has classified processed meats as a &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf?.com"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; (the same category as tobacco), while diets rich in plant-based proteins are linked to lower risks of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4702" data-end="4862"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4704" data-end="4862"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4704" data-end="4724"&gt;Community impact&lt;/strong&gt;: Factory farming systems often rely on exploited labor, polluted waterways, and rural communities bearing the brunt of industrial runoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4864" data-end="5023"&gt;Loving animals but eating meat isn’t just a personal paradox—it’s a cultural one. But change is possible, and it doesn’t require abandoning heritage or flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5025" data-end="5080"&gt;A gentle unblocking: how to realign values and meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5082" data-end="5319"&gt;So what can you do if you feel the stirrings of that paradox in your own life? Start by removing blame. You’re not a bad person for growing up with barbecue Sundays or loving your grandma’s chicken soup. Food is cultural. Food is memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5321" data-end="5389"&gt;But here’s how you can begin to bridge the empathy gap—step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5391" data-end="5413"&gt;1. Name the animal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5415" data-end="5674"&gt;Use their real name. Cow instead of beef. Pig instead of pork. Doing this gently reanimates the beings behind the bites. Research shows that meat-eaters who are reminded of the animal origins of food report increased discomfort—and decreased desire to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5676" data-end="5702"&gt;2. Learn their stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5704" data-end="5871"&gt;Follow animal sanctuaries on Instagram. Read about rescued farm animals. Watch short clips of cows playing or pigs cuddling. This isn’t manipulation—it’s reconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5873" data-end="5993"&gt;The more we see animals as individuals, the harder it becomes to overlook their suffering. That’s not guilt—it’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5995" data-end="6018"&gt;3. Redefine protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6020" data-end="6293"&gt;We often justify meat consumption through nutrition. But the truth? Beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, and even oats are packed with protein. A 2023 Harvard study showed that plant-based diets easily meet protein needs—with added benefits for heart health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6295" data-end="6365"&gt;Empathy doesn’t have to clash with health. They can align beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6367" data-end="6388"&gt;4. Cook with care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6390" data-end="6614"&gt;Shift the ritual. If meat has always been the centerpiece of your plate, try flipping the script: let seasonal veggies shine, experiment with spice-forward marinades, or recreate comfort food classics with plant-based swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6616" data-end="6743"&gt;I once made my grandmother’s birria using jackfruit and ancho chiles. It wasn’t identical—but it was soulful, and she loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6745" data-end="6780"&gt;5. Make space for in-betweeners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6782" data-end="7048"&gt;You don’t need to go “all or nothing” overnight. Flexitarian, reducetarian, or plant-curious—there’s room for nuance. Reducing meat even a few meals a week can significantly lower your carbon footprint, support animal welfare, and free up mental space for alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7050" data-end="7079"&gt;6. Involve your community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7081" data-end="7259"&gt;Invite friends over for a plant-based potluck. Share recipes instead of lectures. When change feels communal, it’s more likely to stick—and it becomes a source of joy, not shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7261" data-end="7290"&gt;7. Celebrate flavor first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7292" data-end="7510"&gt;Plant-based eating is not about subtraction. It’s about expansion. Charred eggplant with miso glaze, roasted corn esquites, mango-chili ceviche made with hearts of palm—these dishes deliver both comfort and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7512" data-end="7552"&gt;The emotional side of shifting habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7554" data-end="7754"&gt;Change can bring up grief. You might miss certain textures, or the nostalgia of a family recipe. That’s okay. Acknowledge it. Food is tied to identity, and you’re not losing anything—you’re expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7756" data-end="8072"&gt;In fact, many people who reduce or eliminate meat report a surprising benefit: they feel &lt;em data-start="7845" data-end="7854"&gt;lighter&lt;/em&gt;, emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8074" data-end="8212"&gt;That’s because the empathy switch doesn’t have to stay off forever. You can turn it back on—and when you do, the world often feels richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8214" data-end="8248"&gt;The upshot? Empathy is a muscle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8250" data-end="8441"&gt;The more we use it, the stronger it gets. And yes—sometimes that means feeling more. But it also means living more truthfully, more tenderly, and more in sync with the values we already hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8443" data-end="8608"&gt;You can love animals. You can even grieve what you didn’t know. And you can still eat well, with joy, color, and deep cultural roots—just pointed in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8610" data-end="8692"&gt;Because the heart has room for both compassion and change. And your plate can too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1s - which mimic the effects of the hormone that stimulates insulin release, suppressing glucagon, and slowing stomach emptying - also have a range of other benefits including significant weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and potential cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they too come with negative side effects, including vomiting, mood changes and vision problems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe the new findings could help shape future clinical guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially with GLP-1 medication costs decreasing due to market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, the researchers drew on anonymized electronic health records from a global health research network (Trinetx) spanning the period 2004 to 2024 to track the development of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had been treated with either GLP-1s or metformin (there were 87,229 patients in each group with an average age of 58) for at least six consecutive months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the data, the researchers found that GLP-1 drugs were &lt;span&gt;associated with a significantly lower (10 percent) risk of developing dementia, overall, with an incidence of about 2.5 percent compared with an incidence of nearly five percent for metformin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And specifically, taking this type of drug was associated with a 12 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and a 25 percent lower risk of developing other non-vascular dementias than metformin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further in-depth analyses showed that these positive effects were evident across all age groups, but with the strongest effect among people over 60, women, and those of White ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Risk of death from any cause was also lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers believe the new findings could help shape future clinical guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially with GLP-1 medication costs gradually decreasing due to market competition &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly five percent of those treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists died compared with nearly nine percent of those treated with metformin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With metformin, the researchers note that the benefits primarily derive through a variety of metabolic processes that impact the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include reducing glucose production in the liver, increasing insulin sensitivity, and influencing gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;span&gt; exert direct effects on the central nervous system by crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows them to act on GLP-1 receptors within the brain, influencing various functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, this could make them a more effective solution than metformin, especially when it comes to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the researchers point out that the tracking period, while sufficient for observing dementia outcomes, may not fully capture long-term cognitive effects, especially given the progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They conclude: 'Given the severe societal, familial, and economic burden of diabetes-related dementia, these findings raise important considerations about the role of GLP-1 [receptor agonists] as first-line therapies in [type 2 diabetes] management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While further long-term studies are warranted to validate these results, integrating GLP-1 [receptor agonists] as primary therapeutic agents may represent a paradigm shift in preventing the cognitive complications of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both medications demonstrate neuroprotective properties, such as reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing cerebrovascular health, which likely contribute to their benefits in overall dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-11697620" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common types of cancer, but fortunately, it’s also one of the most preventable. Research shows that lifestyle changes, particularly in diet, can significantly reduce your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re curious about which foods to incorporate into your weekly meal plan, you're in the right place. Below, we’ve highlighted 6 foods that experts recommend eating weekly (or more frequently!) to help protect and enhance colon health. From &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich veggies&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891453/best-healthy-snacks-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;nutrient-packed nuts&lt;/a&gt;, these choices are packed with flavor and backed by science to potentially reduce colon cancer risk naturally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-broccoli"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Broccoli  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Broccoli and especially broccoli sprouts are some of the top foods I’d recommend to reduce colon cancer risk," shared &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. One reason Katz feels that broccoli is a standout vegetable when it comes to reducing the risk of colon cancer is sulforaphane, a compound known for its powerful cancer-fighting properties. Sulforaphane supports the body in multiple ways, including aiding detoxification, reducing inflammation and protecting colon cells from DNA damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Sulphoraphane has been extensively studied for its chemo preventive properties," Katz added.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The American Institute for Cancer Research also highlights cruciferous vegetables like broccoli as essential for a cancer-protective diet, particularly for colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-dairy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Dairy Milk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming more dairy products may lower the risk of developing and dying from colorectal cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 31 studies found that people with the highest dairy intake had a 21% lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest intake. Milk, in particular, showed a strong protective effect. For colorectal cancer mortality, high dairy consumption was linked to a 29% lower risk of death.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason why dairy milk may be such a positive addition to a colorectal cancer risk–reducing diet is due to the calcium that dairy milk provides. "In a large prospective study of diet and colorectal cancer, there were less occurrences of colorectal cancer in those who consumed more calcium-rich foods," shared &lt;a href="https://theresagentilerd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Theresa Gentile, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-walnuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Walnuts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are a nutritional powerhouse, and their benefits for colon cancer risk reduction make them a standout snack. One of the key reasons is their rich content of omega-3 fatty acids, which help fight inflammation, a factor closely linked to cancer development and progression. Additionally, walnuts are packed with fiber, which supports gut health by feeding beneficial bacteria in the microbiome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What truly sets walnuts apart, though, is their polyphenol compounds. "Our microbiome turns these polyphenols into a compound called Urolithin A," &lt;a href="http://www.nextjenhealth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jen Scheinman, M.S. RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt; explains. This compound has been shown to reduce inflammation and support colon health. "One study followed people who ate roughly a handful of walnuts a day for 3 weeks. The researchers noted that those with the highest levels of Urolithin A after 3 weeks had lower levels of inflammatory markers and had higher levels of a protein called peptide YY, which may help protect against colon cancer," Scheinman explained.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Legumes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pulses and legumes—such as lentils, black beans and chickpeas—are nutritional all-stars when it comes to reducing colon cancer risk, &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, explains. They're packed with fiber, protein and antioxidants, all of which play a role in supporting gut health and reducing inflammation—two key factors in lowering the risk of colon cancer. In fact, recent research continues to show a strong link between high-fiber diets, particularly those rich in legumes, and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One analysis of 29 studies found that people who ate the most legumes had a 10% lower risk of developing colorectal cancer than those who ate the least. Even better: Increasing legume intake by just one serving (about 100 grams or ½ cup) per day was linked to a 21% lower risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating legumes into your diet doesn’t have to be complicated. "It’s OK to start slowly by substituting your favorite beans instead of meat," explained Young. You can toss black beans into a salad, whip up a chickpea-based spread like hummus or enjoy a hearty lentil soup. These simple swaps not only add flavor and variety to your meals but also provide a powerful boost to your colon health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-pistachios"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Pistachios  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pistachios are not only a delicious snack but also a smart choice for reducing colon cancer risk. &lt;a href="https://carolinethomason.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caroline Thomason, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, explains, "Pistachios are a smart snack choice for lowering colon cancer risk," pointing to research that found a 25% lower risk of colon cancer for every 5-gram-per-day increase in total nut intake, including tree nuts like pistachios.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These little green gems are packed with nutrients and fiber, which support gut health and play a role in cancer prevention. Plus, they’re easy to enjoy on their own or as part of a meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research highlights additional reasons to reach for pistachios. Thomason shares that a 2025 clinical trial found that eating about 2 ounces of pistachios daily helped shift gut microbiota composition in a beneficial way, increasing levels of butyrate-producing bacteria, an important factor in colon health and cancer prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, and Thomason suggests treating pistachios as a "sprinkle food" by adding them to salads, oatmeal, yogurt or roasted vegetables. This simple habit not only helps you meet your daily intake goal but also adds flavor, texture and nutrients to your meals, making pistachios a tasty and powerful ally for your colon health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Watermelon  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Watermelon isn’t just refreshing for summer; it’s also a fantastic food for reducing colon cancer risk. "Watermelon is also a food to keep on your radar as it is high in lycopene, which has been associated with reduced risk of colon cancer," &lt;a href="http://www.sharniquiawhite.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sharniquea White, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, explained.  Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage and reduces inflammation, both of which are key in lowering cancer risk.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Recent studies have shown just how impactful watermelon can be. White points out that "higher watermelon intake could reduce colon cancer risks by 26%."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s a significant benefit for such a simple and delicious food!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While incorporating these foods into your weekly diet is a fantastic start, other lifestyle changes can amplify your results. Here are additional tips for lowering your colon cancer risk:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess weight, particularly around the abdomen, has been linked to higher colon cancer risk. Stay active and eat a balanced diet to support healthy weight maintenance.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking plenty of water helps keep your digestive system moving and prevents constipation, a potential contributor to colon health issues. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit ultra-processed meats:&lt;/strong&gt; Diets high in ultra-processed meats like bacon and hot dogs have been associated with increased colon cancer risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity improves digestion and reduces inflammation. Aim for at least 30 minutes of movement most days of the week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking and limit alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; Both habits can damage cells and increase cancer risk. Reducing or eliminating them can make a big difference. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to preventing colon cancer, what you eat plays a critical role. Including foods like broccoli, dairy milk, walnuts, pulses, pistachios and watermelon in your weekly diet can go a long way toward supporting colon health and reducing your cancer risk. Paired with other good-for-you habits like staying active, staying hydrated and eating mindfully, these dietary choices can make a significant impact on your overall well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small, consistent changes are the key to long-term health. Try incorporating these foods one by one and enjoy the benefits they bring—not just for your colon but for your body as a whole. A healthier you starts at the root of your habits, so stock up on these nutrient-packed foods.&lt;br&gt;

On &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorcirclejerk/comments/1lb3ofj/that_hung_smile/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TomHolland/comments/1ltx2r2/that_hung_smile/"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ethanforyou/video/7519241110414282039?q=%22hung%20smile%22&amp;amp;t=1751983880792"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@filmaged/video/7503958773132807454?q=%22hung%20smile%22&amp;amp;t=1751983880792"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://x.com/legendpoe/status/1937245315188556208"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ghostgabe.bsky.social/post/3lsjmewietk2k"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, people have described these men as having a “hung smile” to suggest it’s representative of them being well endowed. Of course, they have no way of really knowing—which is why some of the “hung smile” posts &lt;a href="https://x.com/narutopeachs/status/1913966286515675647"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/wildflowertv/status/1938314096962847062"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/_uncle_gworl/status/1872463955127619876"&gt;purposefully&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/emonormie/status/1934117024763924555"&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s no clear throughline, and even those posting about “hung smiles” concede it’s just another way for them to say these guys are hot. “It’s used a lot to compliment masculine and buff men, especially male actors, singers, influencers etc.,” said the anonymous person behind the X account @fabbgrat—they went viral earlier in July with a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/fabbgrat/status/1942207363622011281"&gt;hung smile” post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/07/superman-2025-movie-reviews-new-james-gunn.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; star David Corenswet that was favorited more than 58,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr2000093b77k3gjdccb@published"&gt;“Hung smile” has existed online for many years, albeit in a different form—a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317173425/https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hung%20smile"&gt;2011 entry&lt;/a&gt; on Urban Dictionary stated it referred at the time to the fond smile a person might demonstrate when recalling the size of their ex-partner’s extraordinarily huge penis. Its current meaning appears to have been popularized late last year thanks to a post about a surprising figure: accused health care CEO killer &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/12/luigi-mangione-manifesto-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson.html"&gt;Luigi Mangione.&lt;/a&gt; When police released images of a suspect during their manhunt in December, &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/flick-that-bean-one-night-in-times-square-with-blizzy-mcguire"&gt;Blizzy McGuire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.papermag.com/blizzy-season"&gt;shit-posting&lt;/a&gt; social media star who gave the world the “&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/christian-girl-autumn-meme-caitlin-convington-emily-gemma"&gt;Christian Girl Autumn” meme&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, proclaimed that the handsome man seen smiling in CCTV footage had “that hung smile.” Their &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1864732383859093789"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; has since been seen more than 9.3 million times on X, causing McGuire to ask &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1934489278777602121"&gt;six months later&lt;/a&gt; whether she was responsible for the term’s ascendence. (Seems so!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr4y000a3b77scjqzzop@published"&gt;So is it possible for someone’s smile to be an outward reflection of what lies beneath? No, you horny idiots. Well, rather … not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, explained Justin Dubin, a &lt;a href="https://www.mhs.net/providers/d/dubin-justin"&gt;Florida urologist&lt;/a&gt;, member of the American Urological Association, and co-host of a &lt;a href="https://www.themanuppod.com/"&gt;podcast about men’s health&lt;/a&gt;. Aptly comparing “hung smiles” to “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/big-dick-energy-bde"&gt;big dick energy&lt;/a&gt;” (a term &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/27/17506898/big-dick-energy-explained"&gt;popularized in 2018&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande’s relationship), Dubin said that what people may actually be responding to in these men could be a perceived sense of self-confidence that may or may not be connected to penis size. “If you have a perceived larger penis size, you’ll have a more favorable image to yourself,” Dubin said. “Because you’re more confident in yourself, maybe you do have a big dick energy because of the fact you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; you have a bigger dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr7z000b3b77zbaiyxqt@published"&gt;The first step to understanding any of this is appreciating that the relationship between a man and his penis can be extraordinarily personal, and a lot of men don’t like what they see downstairs. As many as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/31/health.medicineandhealth1"&gt;almost half of all guys&lt;/a&gt; may be dissatisfied with their size, even if &lt;a href="https://peplau.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2017/07/Lever_Frederick_Peplau_2006.pdf"&gt;85 percent of their female partners&lt;/a&gt; are more than pleased. (Among gay men, there is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180909065240/https://www.gmfa.org.uk/fs160-the-penis-issue"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; penis size might matter a touch more, and may determine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2874247/"&gt;whether they are more likely to top or bottom&lt;/a&gt;). As with most body-image issues, a man’s perception of his penis is often affected by media he may consume. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107944/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; interviewing six men who had undergone penile augmentation surgery found they were often influenced by seeing large penises in pornography or hearing jokes about small penises in mainstream media. (Just as an FYI, a &lt;a href="https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010"&gt;2014 international study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 15,000 penises found an average erect length of 5.16 inches and girth of 4.6 inches.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prb5000c3b77eawaf78f@published"&gt;Crucially, though, whether a man is smaller than average or not, men who &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they’re on the smaller side are likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/dissatisfaction-with-penis-size-and-genital-appearance-tied-to-mental-health-issues-in-men/#google_vignette"&gt;less sexually satisfied&lt;/a&gt; and more likely to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2024.2363275#abstract"&gt;anxiety or depression&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, guys who do seem self-assured or happy with their junk may thus naturally radiate big dick energy, whether justifiably or not. That’s in line with the findings of one &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-09081-001"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; that found men who rated their penises as larger than average also believed themselves to be more attractive overall, suggesting a general confidence boost because of their perceived size.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prdy000d3b77xybjcoxw@published"&gt;One of the study’s authors, David Frederick, who is an associate professor of psychology at California’s Chapman University, presented some unpublished research at the Sexuality Preconference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology this year. Frederick found that men who reported having larger penises and greater upper-body muscularity were also more confident flirting and pursuing romantic relationships. “Men’s views of their penis size were far more important than their height or weight for identifying which men were more confident hitting on a stranger or asking for their number,” Frederick told me.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prgz000e3b77wubgork2@published"&gt;“There are obviously no studies on whether men with larger penises have more confident smiles, but there are reasons these men might have something to smile about,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prjz000f3b777r1u6b91@published"&gt;Seeking further clarity, I reached out to the first person who came to mind: the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/girthmaster-onlyfans-creator-adult-star-viral-1235009248/"&gt;Girthmasterr&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;OnlyFans creator&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href="https://x.com/zoneofcarlos/status/1782047063070716223"&gt;virally famous&lt;/a&gt; last year thanks to his 8-inch-long, 7-inch-circumferenced penis. “There’s definitely truth to the big dick smile,” he told me. “It comes from knowing that your dick is big enough to get the job done—you need only the opportunity to prove it. You’re immune to the dick-measuring contest without any effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prmx000g3b77lsi83wbk@published"&gt;Truth be told, I didn’t notice anything particularly distinctive about the Girthmasterr’s smile. In &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5hILIrPjTw/?hl=en"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7vPMbgRnKu/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;, he shows his teeth, but in &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;many others he doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;. He just looks sort of … normal, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHwHc4T0q5/?hl=en"&gt;confident&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHpqkl6x7nl/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;. But the Girthmasterr said the thing that gives him this energy is being free from the mental anguish he believes smaller guys suffer from. “The real confidence of having a big dick comes from knowing how unimportant it is to many women, whereas men that don’t have a big dick will always wonder ‘What if,’ ” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prpw000h3b77fy29zry3@published"&gt;Dubin, the urologist, can understand where the current boom in “hung smile” jokes comes from because he believes it’s very normal to want to speculate about the size of a man’s penis. In the past, people have tried to deduce men’s size by gleaning things from their height, race, hand span, or foot size. However, Dubin said there’s not much scientific data to support any general connection between these features and the penis. He did, however, point to some studies that suggested things like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37305632/"&gt;nose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a38021905/nose-penis-size-connection-doctor-explains-anthony-youn/"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38123633/index-finger-penis-size-ratio-tiktok/"&gt;finger length&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17191423/"&gt;butt size&lt;/a&gt; may be connected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prtg000i3b77sut7z3ov@published"&gt;If people are drawing connections between a man’s smile and his penis, it may also be because there is evidence that the reverse is true. In 2022, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-022-10000-y"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that people shown pictures of different men’s penises made judgments about their personality and handsomeness. Prototypical penises were associated with attractiveness, being good in bed, agreeableness, and openness to experiences. Meanwhile, men with narrower penises were thought to be more neurotic, while those with wider ones were seen as more extroverted and sexually active. “First impressions really, really matter,” New Mexico Highlands University assistant professor of psychology Thomas R. Brooks, one of the researchers behind the study, told me. “When we don’t have a lot of information on somebody when we first meet them or encounter them, whether that’s in person or online, we take what we get and we have what are called heuristics that we use to make shortcut assumptions about people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prwi000j3b77v3bdljqs@published"&gt;Brooks conceded he hadn’t heard of the “hung smile” term until I contacted him, but believed it could be a phenomenon that warrants further study. He suggested, though, that what might be occurring is a variation of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/halo-effect.html"&gt;halo effect&lt;/a&gt;, whereby we allow our positive judgment of a person in one area of their life—in this case, their appearance or smile—to color our perception of them in other areas. “If you see a cute dude on social media, and he’s got the ‘hung smile’ and you’re initially attracted to him, then you’re probably going to generalize that good feeling you have to other areas, like that he’s got a great personality, he takes care of his mom, and he probably has a big dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0przg000k3b77b4e42oi7@published"&gt;However, it’s also possible that if you’re attracted to a man’s “hung smile,” you could just be attracted to his smile alone. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7854600/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that bigger smiles were perceived as more attractive, meaning that you’re probably just projecting other things about that man with a big grin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0ps2b000l3b7731wsofw8@published"&gt;At the end of the day, Dubin believes the only way to correctly determine the size of a man’s junk is to actually measure it. After all, he would know. “I’ve seen more penises than 99 percent of people, and I have no idea,” he said. “I cannot predict what anyone’s penis size is when they walk into that room.” But even if you’re not a guy who’s packing, Dubin suggested you can simply fake it till you make it: “Believing and acting like you have a big dick, people will think that you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At just 17 years old, he finds himself facing unexpected pressure from his family after his young niece is diagnosed with leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really really don’t want to sound egoistic, but I’m a guy with long hair, which over the years has basically become my personality,” the teen explains in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m49412/aitah_for_refusing_to_cut_off_my_hair_because_my/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:his post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;. He says that while he’s always cared for his niece and her family, he’s struggling with the idea of giving up the one thing that brings him confidence and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of man shaving child's hair&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation begins when his 7-year-old niece is diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a moment that the teen says “basically broke their family apart.” Wanting to be supportive, he makes efforts to emotionally be there for his niece and the rest of the family during the difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things shift when chemotherapy causes his niece’s “beautiful long blonde hair” to fall out, and her family decides to shave her head. “The next day, a group chat including the entire family was created where my aunt announced it would be wholesome if everyone shaved their hair off as well,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the teen finds the idea “wholesome,” but admits he doubts anyone would actually follow through. That changes quickly when he comes home to find both his mother and sister already bald. “[Followed] by my other cousin, and grandma,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure mounts when his mother confronts him the next morning. “When are you ready to do it?” she asks, trimmer in hand. The teen is stunned. “I originally thought it was something to decide on your own,” he says. “But since everyone else is doing it, I’m kind of being pushed into a corner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he deeply loves his niece, the teen can’t ignore how much his hair means to him. “It’s pretty much the only thing about myself I love,” he admits. He also questions how much the gesture really matters to his niece, recalling a video his aunt took of her reaction to other family members shaving their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She has to tap her maybe 4 times to get her attention, and when she looks, she just stares at it, says ‘wow’ and continues watching her cartoon,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching that video, he notices his mom becoming “pushy” about him doing the same. “In other words, she wants to drag me down into the pit with her,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things intensify when he receives a text from his aunt urging him to shave his head too. “She said it would be really nice if I shaved my head as well, in order to show my emotional support,” he writes. But the teen questions whether the act would truly have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we have to keep things real, shaving my head will basically change nothing in the entire situation,” he says. “But I can’t just say no, can I?” He reveals that what stings the most is the lack of acknowledgment shown to the family members who already shaved their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If my aunt would have shown a little more appreciation to my sister and mom, I would have probably considered it,” he admits. “But considering she did not even reply to the pictures and just immediately showed them to my niece, as if you HAVE to do it, I don’t think I’m willing to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of family upset with teen boy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the emotional weight of the decision, the teen reiterates his love for his niece. “I really really really love my niece,” he writes. “And even though I’m not that close with her, I always really cared about her and made sure she always felt comfortable with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the emotional burden is growing, and the teen feels outnumbered. “I’m almost getting threatened to cut off my hair by three people,” he shares. What troubles him most is the fear of sacrificing something personal only for it to go unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I do decide to do it, what if no appreciation is shown?” he asks. “Yes, I would have done it, to show support from my side, but if it’s nowhere to be appreciated, then what’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Redditors weigh in, including cancer survivors themselves. “Don’t do it,” one commenter writes. “I never asked, wanted anyone to do that. It made me feel worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another commenter echoes that sentiment. “As a cancer patient, I never understood this gesture,” they say. “I also see it as attention seeking behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen ends his post not with anger, but with a question that reflects the emotional complexity of his situation. “But really, what do I do?” he asks. “I seriously really don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/teen-sparks-family-fallout-over-refusal-to-shave-head-for-niece-with-cancer-11776303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 21:33:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VTzJGM053emN4d1VWRzltRG5nWWZBb2E4NmVSSkhSbG5Yb2NIOVk5eV96UnFZUmZQRGxxTHdXcVB2S04wSHVGaDBHUmVJUVJCNDNqZ3BnS2dRSllzUnM0SFV1Mjl4QVN5X3FVaUR0YWZIaGx1aFRTRlFR</guid></item><item><title>中西部小溪与二战放射性废物相关的癌症发病率较高-雅虎首页 | Higher cancer rates linked to WWII radioactive waste in Midwestern creek - Yahoo Home</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPZGkxWS1mRFlYQzZzWmY1V1lhUmYzVGJwVWxWQV9YSUNiZjduQVhxenA1SVBGb3c1RWo5OXQ5U1JYZ3Q0OGpPUTVqN0xUZWdUQXNqN0wwelY0Wkd5S3FjNXJhWk05akJMZzU0N1h0Mjk5V1kyeXdCSzlKcERUTWRBWEtFUW1HSkh2RWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Missouri creek has allegedly led to a higher &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Coldwater Creek, a Missouri River tributary north of St. Louis, has been a known radioactive waste site since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have now confirmed that exposure to the creek, which is said to be polluted with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/nuclear" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuclear waste;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt; from the development of the first atomic bomb, has led to an increased incidence of cancer for people who were children in the area between the 1940s and 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/mans-deadly-brain-cancer-tumor-disappears-after-experimental-drug-trial" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Man's Deadly Brain Cancer Tumor Disappears After Experimental Drug Trial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man's Deadly Brain Cancer Tumor Disappears After Experimental Drug Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A study from the Harvard T.H.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — A South Carolina children's hospital has confirmed a death from a &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health sent an email out Tuesday evening saying that the "organism is presumed to have occurred at Lake Murray."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Heath Richland Children's Hospital in Columbia confirmed Tuesday that a patient treated at their facility died from the organism. This announcement came a day after the South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) confirmed that there was a case of someone contracting the illness, but did not confirm a death. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We send our condolences to the family,” said Dr. Anna Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Prisma Health Children's Hospital. “The people here at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital care, and just want you to know that we’re thinking of your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Health did not give any additional details regarding the patient, including the person's age and where that person may have come into contact with the amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba--whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri--can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The Centers for Disease Control stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPH says there have been 167 cases reported nationwide in the past 62 years. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burch held a media briefing Tuesday where she addressed questions about the amoeba. Here is a summary of some of those response and questions some people may be answering in the wake of this news. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What is N&lt;em&gt;aegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is an amoeba that is ubiquitous to any fresh water in the state of South Carolina and honestly in the Southeast in general, Burch said. "So any lake, river, pond, or hot spring that you could come into contact with in South Carolina will have this amoeba in it. It typically lives in the silt at the bottom of lakes and rivers."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that for most people who come in contact with this type of amoeba, it causes no harm whatsoever. Most of us have been exposed to this amoeba who have been in lakes and rivers and those kind of things. The problem is, is that it's not an issue when we come in contact with it.  Where it becomes a problem is if water with the amoeba forcefully enters the nose is able to cross from the nose into the brain. It cause a syndrome called primary amoeba meningoencephalitis.... which causes the brain to swell. More than 97% of reported U.S. cases have been fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burch adds the amoeba does not exist in salt water, so there is no risk if you're at the beach near the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;How common is this infection?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my career as a pediatric infectious disease physician in South Carolina, I’ve now seen two cases," Burch said "There has only been one reported case in the state this year, and this is that case.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What can parents do to protect their children?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding forceful entry of water into the nose during activities like diving, tubing, or skiing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching kids to blow out their nose or hold their nose when jumping into water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using nose clips during freshwater activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding digging in shallow, sandy or silty areas, where the amoeba lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, never use untreated tap water for nasal irrigation devices like neti pots. Tap water must be boiled and cooled, or use sterile or distilled water instead.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Should families avoid swimming in lakes and rivers?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tough question, especially for those of us raised in the South where freshwater swimming is a summer tradition. The risk increases during extremely hot temperatures. Families should weigh the risks and take precautions like nose clips, avoiding dunking, or choosing to float instead of diving. Pools and splash pads are typically safe because they are chlorinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is the risk greater in warmer weather? &lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The risk definitely is increased when it's hotter temperatures, such as when we get these 100 degree days. So if you do happen to go into the water during those times, I think having a discussion with your children about why it's so important to learn how to not get water up the nose, have things like the nose clips out there. Maybe decide not to go on the tube and just float around with floats and those kind of things."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What’s your advice for concerned parents?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare infection—fewer than 10 cases are reported per year in the U.S. But knowing how it spreads and how to reduce risk is the best thing you can do. We shouldn’t be afraid of our lakes and rivers, but we should be informed and cautious. Educate your kids, use nose protection, and make the decision that’s right for your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms usually begin around five days after exposure, but it can range from one to twelve days. It starts with a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vomiting, and diarrhea. If your child has recently been in freshwater and shows any of those symptoms, it’s critical to tell your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it found in tap water?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but there have been isolated cases where &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; was found in tap water. Chlorinated water should not carry risk, but again, never use tap water for nasal rinsing unless it’s been properly boiled or sterilized.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it difficult to diagnose?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, because it’s so rare, it’s not always top-of-mind for providers. That’s why it’s vital to mention any recent freshwater exposure to your doctor. Knowing that can help guide proper testing and quicker diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

By analyzing gene activity from healthy and neurodegenerative brain tissue, they pinpointed 453 interventions predicted to reverse cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial animal tests showed improvements in behavior, cognition, and molecular markers of youth in older mice. This breakthrough paves the way for therapies that could protect against neurodegeneration and promote brain health in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning tool predicts biological brain cell age using gene data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejuvenation Hits:&lt;/strong&gt; Identified 453 compounds that reverse age-related cell decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice treated with predicted compounds showed improved memory and younger gene profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if there was a way to make aging brain cells younger again? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team from Spain and Luxembourg recently set out to address this question. After developing an aging clock capable of assessing the biological age of the brain, they used it to identify possible brain-rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational tool they created, recently presented in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science,&lt;/em&gt; constitutes a valuable resource to find compounds with therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111884"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a clock and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “aging clock”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world population is aging rapidly, with over two billion people projected to be above the age of 60 by 2050, age-related brain disorders are on the rise. Living longer but in poor health is not only a daunting prospect; it also places a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of being able to counteract the functional decline of our brain through rejuvenating interventions sounds therefore promising. The question is how can we identify compounds that have the potential to efficiently rejuvenate brain cells and to protect the aging population from neurodegeneration? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Antonio Del Sol and his teams of computational biologists, based both at CIC bioGUNE, member of BRTA, and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) from the University of Luxembourg, used their machine learning expertise to tackle the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a clock to measure the biological age of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “&lt;em&gt;aging clock&lt;/em&gt;”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the organs and tissues of people of the same age can evolve differently over time depending on genetic and environmental factors, leading to different biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clocks are therefore useful tools to assess aging at the molecular level and can help in understanding its causes and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock designed by CIC bioGUNE and LCSB researchers is specific to the brain and uses gene expression information from 365 genes to make predictions. Using a machine learning approach, it was trained on data from healthy individuals, aged from 20 to 97, and could accurately predict their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that the clock is able to estimate the biological age of different cell types in the brain, especially neurons. Lastly, by looking at the predicted biological ages for healthy individuals and for patients with neurological conditions, the researchers observed that patients exhibited a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results tell us that the biological age of the brain cells calculated by our clock reflects the decline in brain function experienced by the patients, especially between 60 and 70, and is even correlated with the degree of neurodegeneration,” explains Dr. Guillem Santamaria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It supports the view of neurodegeneration as a form of accelerated aging but, more importantly, the positive association between neurodegeneration and biological age suggests that the rejuvenating interventions identified by the clock could serve as neuroprotective agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying compounds that have a rejuvenating potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the researchers was to use the clock to find genetic or chemical interventions that would signiﬁcantly shift back the biological age of brain cells. They explored the effect of thousands of compounds on neural progenitor cells and neurons and identified 453 unique rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the identified compounds that have the potential to reverse the biological age of the two types of brain cells, several are known to extend lifespan in animal models and some are already used to treat neurological disorders, but the vast majority has not yet been studied in the context of health- or lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the one hand, the fact that our computational platform identified drugs that have a known effect on brain function supports the idea that using the predicted effect of a compound on the biological age is an efficient way to evaluate its neuroprotective potential,” details Prof. Antonio Del Sol, Ikerbasque researcher and head of the Computation Biology groups at CIC bioGUNE and LCSB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other, the results also highlight that our clock can help us find many new candidates that haven’t been studied before for their rejuvenating properties. It opens up a lot of new avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First validation in animal model and broadening the therapeutic horizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept of their approach, the researchers then tested three of the predicted compounds in mice, in collaboration with the team of Prof. Rubén Nogueiras at the Centre for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of these drugs signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety and slightly increased spatial memory in older mice, addressing two well-known symptoms associated with aging. An analysis of gene expression showed that the combination of these compounds also led to a shift toward a younger phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these results show that a selection of compounds predicted to rejuvenate the brain did produce rejuvenation at the molecular level in the cortex of aged mice and had an impact on behavioural and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the study, recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;, highlights the computational aging clock developed by the researchers as a valuable resource for identifying brain-rejuvenating interventions with therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. It provides a strong foundation for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hundreds of compounds predicted by our platform require validation across multiple biological systems to assess their eﬃcacy and safety, oﬀering extensive opportunities for future therapeutic development,” concludes Prof. Antonio Del Sol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurogenesis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3d9c0d6ddd7c1d2f3d0dad0d1dadcd4c6ddd69dd6c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jana Sendra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cicbiogune.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jana Sendra – CIC bioGUNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Antonio Del Sol Mesa et al. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in life expectancy has caused a rise in age-related brain disorders. Although brain rejuvenation is a promising strategy to counteract brain functional decline, systematic discovery methods for efficient interventions are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computational platform based on a transcriptional brain aging clock capable of detecting age- and neurodegeneration-related changes is developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to neurodegeneration-positive samples, it reveals that neurodegenerative disease presence and severity significantly increase predicted age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By screening 43840 transcriptional profiles of chemical and genetic perturbations, it identifies 453 unique rejuvenating interventions, several of which are known to extend lifespan in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the identified interventions include drugs already used to treat neurological disorders, Alzheimer’s disease among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of compounds predicted by the platform reduced anxiety, improved memory, and rejuvenated the brain cortex transcriptome in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate the platform’s ability to identify brain-rejuvenating interventions, offering potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:52:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE4zMWVTLWU4UVZvVnFhbUdWS3R0YW5lZVZZUl9tOTR3amZoRnExLWp5N2xzYmx3Vm56R1ViQ1p4emN1V1Bxa0tBOU5Hak1RSEM3aFNNdU5sZFF5SFJ1TWwxUzh4Ykx1WHRsblBIRg</guid></item><item><title>科学家增压糖替代品–它开始杀死癌症- SciTechDaily | Scientists Supercharge Sugar Substitute – And It Starts Killing Cancer - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:13:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR</guid></item><item><title>麸质可能被错误地归咎于美国人的胃病- Gizmodo | Gluten Could Be Wrongly Blamed for Americans’ Stomach Troubles - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQYmlEeHp0RXJCbWdsbzJHV0VreFhyTmlIdndOOUxjUDZENnBMT2VrSUhObVFNWmpzNnVkSTVuMHhGRS0tV056VEY5Szc1Z2xYZWtyYk9EYmEzNDJQaDU3RDllRWpVZTFRakczMmE5aEhkdkJrWnJZMjJCeUVnTmZUZ3VXekhZYzlXajhGSFNzQ3JMcDdSenpZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;For many of us, gluten is a dietary villain, capable of causing all sorts of gastrointestinal troubles. Research out this week looks to complicate that narrative, however, finding that people are sometimes wrongly blaming gluten for triggering their symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at McMaster University in Canada conducted the study, a small, randomized trial of IBS patients. People became sicker just as often after eating food containing gluten or wheat as they did after eating food without the ingredient, they found. Gluten is likely safer to eat for those with IBS than commonly thought, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that expectations played a major role in symptom generation and that only some of these patients could benefit from gluten or wheat restriction,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(25)00090-1/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016"&gt;IBS&lt;/a&gt; is a complex, chronic, and relatively common condition, estimated to affect between 5 and 10% of the population worldwide (including up to &lt;a href="https://aboutibs.org/what-is-ibs/facts-about-ibs/#:~:text=IBS%20affects%20between%2025%20and%2045%20million%20people%20in%20the%20United%20States."&gt;45 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.). Its symptoms include stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. Unlike the closely named inflammatory bowel disorder, IBS isn’t marked by physical changes or visible damage along the digestive tract, but it can still be a debilitating burden for many, with around 20% of sufferers experiencing severe bouts. The exact causes of IBS remain unclear, though scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; it can arise from a miscommunication between the nerves found in the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with IBS tend to report having specific triggers that can cause a flare-up of illness, gluten included, and often manage their condition by avoiding these triggers. The researchers behind the new study aimed to better understand gluten’s potential role in IBS, so they recruited over two dozen people with IBS for their randomized, double-blinded trial, all of whom had reported improving after switching to a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All the groups were first told to eat cereal bars for a week. One group ate bars made with flour containing gluten, the second ate bars made with wheat flour, and the third ate bars made with gluten- and wheat-free flour. Afterward, the volunteers took a break for two weeks. Then they switched to eating the bars they hadn’t eaten yet for another round of testing, a process repeated twice. By the study’s end, all the volunteers had eaten all three kinds of bars, though on different schedules and without knowing which bars they had eaten on a given week.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A total of 28 people completed the trial. A significant percentage of people reported having worsening IBS symptoms after eating gluten or wheat bars, the study showed, but about just as often as they did after eating non-gluten/wheat bars (roughly a third experienced worsening IBS during each of the three conditions). 93% of participants also reported having adverse events after each scenario of bar-eating. Interestingly enough, tests of the participants’ stool found that only a third strictly followed their diets as instructed, with likely many fearing they would get sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on a very small sample size, so it’s not yet certain that they apply to the general population of people with IBS tied to gluten. There are also, of course, digestive conditions clearly caused by an intolerance to gluten, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;. And the researchers aren’t saying gluten can’t sometimes be a genuine trigger for people’s IBS. But they argue that in many cases, people’s negative perception of gluten is causing a nocebo effect, the dark cousin of the placebo effect. In other words, someone’s belief that gluten is bad for them can potentially spark or worsen the IBS symptoms seen after eating it, rather than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say better communication and follow-up care from doctors are needed for IBS patients, given the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. Many of them may benefit from psychological support and guidance to help destigmatize gluten and wheat and reintroduce them safely in their diet,” said senior author Premysl Bercik, a professor at McMaster’s Department of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/despite-self-perceived-sensitivities-study-finds-gluten-and-wheat-safe-for-many-people-with-ibs/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;That may be easier said than done, though. The researchers note that most patients, upon learning the team’s findings, staunchly refused to entertain the idea of gluten not being a trigger for their IBS symptoms. So it looks like gluten may need a promotional campaign to win back its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, states in New England had the lowest STD rates, with Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine falling to the bottom of the list.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rankings, provided by a new study from &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/?srsltid=AfmBOooNQyZ5MZ9gm21GyNZIcNT8cTFh1UwMoIAt7HpC5XyYbYOX1y3E"&gt;Invigor Medical&lt;/a&gt;, used the latest CDC data - from 2023 - to calculate STD rates for all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found many states ranking in the top 10 have limited access to sexual health clinics and emphasize abstinence education as a primary method to prevent pregnancy and STDs, which could be drivers behind their higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many states do not mandate sex education in schools, meaning millions of students miss out on potentially life-saving information. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States like Alaska and South Dakota also have higher numbers of outbreaks among Indigenous populations, which are more likely to have limited access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People in the New England region, on the other hand, typically have higher household incomes and rates of insurance, making them better able to access care and sexual education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report also found women in the US are 10 percent more likely than men to be diagnosed with an STD, with a rate of 902 cases per 100,000 compared to 819. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be because women are screened more often during routine reproductive health visits, while cases in men may go undiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vagina also has a moist, thin lining that is easily penetrable, making it prone to infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana had the country's highest rate of chlamydia with 792 cases per 100,000 residents. This added up to 36,242 diagnoses in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, chlamydia affects 1.6million Americans every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, pain during intercourse, irregular bleeding, and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, less than half of infections show symptoms, and many are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mississippi followed close behind overall and had the second-highest rate of chlamydia, with 701 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alaska recorded 1,067 STDs per 100,000 people in 2023 and had the highest rate of gonorrhea at 311 cases per 100,000. This adds up to about 2,280.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. And while the infection can usually be easily treated, some strains are resistant to commonly used antibiotics - making them harder to clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year in Alaska, an unnamed woman in her 50s died from disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) after contracting gonorrhea. This causes her to go into sepsis and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In DGI, gonorrhea infections travel to the bloodstream and infect organs throughout the body due to the infection going untreated. It's thought to occur in just 0.5 percent of gonorrhea cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is one of eight Alaskans to be identified with DGI since January of this year, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart from Invigor Medical shows the rate of STDs by race and ethnicity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart from Invigor Medical shows the rate of STDs in the US by age group and sex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia, which had the fourth-highest rate of STDs overall, topped the list for HIV infections. It had an HIV rate of 25.5 per 100,000, totaling 2,359 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the HIV rate is 14 cases per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the body's immune system and leaves it unable to fight off foreign invaders. Left untreated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia's high rate could be from recent HIV outbreaks in the Atlanta area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Dakota rounded out the top five with an overall STD rate of 1,015 per 100,000. It also had the highest rate of syphilis at 223 per 100,000 or roughly 2,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis among all ages is on the rise nationwide, increasing nearly 80 percent over the past five years, and the surge is worrying public health officials, as the disease can advance to damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart if it goes untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms begin with small open sores on the genitals, mouth, or rectum, as well as enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second stage, a skin rash develops, as well as genitals sores, fever, muscle and joint pain, vision changes, and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the infection advances further, it can inflame and damage heart valves and slowly degrade the brain, causing personality changes, memory loss, difficulty making decisions, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Vermont recorded the fewest STD cases with a rate of 241 per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schools in the state have more robust sexual health education programs than in other areas like the south. Its largest demographic is also over 60, a group historically less affected by STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOZTlhNHYxSGRlYjBBZUowSDNvVlJiZnJSUXkxQ1B5dlBBamdWa29sT2hYLV9oSzhUM1RsaWU2RTUtWDdRdkttLTFuaFp0NGg5US1mSGQwYTlIa1ljcFZmOUZYeEVaSS1jUnhmZ05odGVOUFFRQnlTcnZWd1V3YVJoRG1YMEQtOFM3akNGQmRZemk2LVV3TnfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTWtHS00xR1c4d05WRTFPc2ZwZnZMdWJpVGJYQVFCYnBXak1rbXVJemMySDRrNC1HSzdLN2EzRjA0TVhZWnhzeEFnZXJpQkR5NUZvd2t6Z05NcHY0ZmM0VkZtQzRkN3NMZk52alZ5bzhjUXZYd3llNVpMSXhVbVJ0dkJON0R0RUtSMHFfR1dkcEZvVHl6UG5HY0QxcHc</guid></item><item><title>官员对第一人死亡后致命的昆虫传播疾病的传播发出警报-每日邮报 | Officials sound alarm over the spread of deadly insect-borne disease after first person dies - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPZ0hrSFhqeGxvOVllb3pGcWJMUE9zQVZEaUdWTlNjaG9aaWFTanhFdklnM1U3Nm5YbGZVVXZ1dWI5V0V1RVplQUVkalNkQUZULXpRaXZpVllYVlpISlhVSGtlbm5FeVFiWkFPdklCVzJYdjk1dzQ4ckw4Y3JuT1pzLWMzdi0yUWYyMDBhUmM2bmV4d1N5Y3lhWC02TV8xQVZDOUxlXy1sd1bSAa4BQVVfeXFMTzcwSkYxRVVYWW1PUzFzbkFyTTBicjlLV2pJV3JpV055ZjJCZVIzaUNDdEpSX2VsZzU1UUNrdXZPNFVERDFiYXd6V2NIVHlGMFRBV2MtazJjNXlBTXlsakxWX1h4N0M3cS05WUtIajN1bXBpUFp5Y2g0Q0JtcGw5ZzRCQ0xRdC1PWmV6NGlxc2JDVFdWZm1PLXBIQVJ4Zm1zUXpNYkV3Ry05aGFyclZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14904089/Fears-grow-paralyzing-disease-moves-new-US-states.html"&gt;sounding the alarm&lt;/a&gt; over the rise of a deadly insect-borne disease following America's first death from the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An unnamed individual in Maricopa County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-b468b650-6719-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, was diagnosed with West Nile Virus, which is becoming more prevalent in the US due to a warming climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were&lt;span&gt; among the one percent of patients who develop a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911573/man-paralyzed-doctors-botched-spinal-surgery-pennsylvania.html"&gt;severe form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the virus, which causes dangerous swelling of the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occurs when the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and infects the brain and/or spinal cord, leading to conditions like encephalitis, meningitis, or paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officials revealed the victim was an older adult with underlying health conditions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were the 17th human case of the West Nile virus in the Maricopa County area and among the 51 human cases nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While West Nile virus typically causes mild symptoms, individuals with certain medical conditions - such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-caf71650-670a-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-caf78b80-670a-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, kidney disease, and people who have received organ transplants - are at greater risk of serious health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently West Nile virus activity appears to be at a relatively stable level, but the presence of the virus in places it typically doesn't appear is raising concerns among experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The West Nile virus is the most common mosquito-spread disease in the continental US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because higher temperatures shorten the time it takes for the virus to incubate within the mosquito and become infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, warmer temperatures can enhance mosquito survival and reproduction rates, further amplifying the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maricopa County's chief medical officer Dr Nick Staab said: 'This tragic loss is a reminder that West Nile virus can be serious, especially for older adults and those with existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14891111/health-hazards-hospital-summer-vacation.html"&gt;'Monsoon season brings&lt;/a&gt; much-needed rain, but it also creates ideal conditions for mosquitoes to breed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most cases have been recorded in Arizona (17 cases), &lt;span&gt;followed by Louisiana (seven), Oklahoma and Texas (five) and Tennessee (three).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other states with human cases of West Nile virus are California, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 51 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 24 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, there were 748 human cases of the virus recorded, including 515 neuroinvasive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worry among experts is that West Nile virus is spreading to new areas, and mosquitoes carrying the virus are being found in previously unaffected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly due to climate change, which is expanding the range of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, West Nile virus has been detected in mosquitoes in New York City, but no human cases have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a person is bitten by an infected mosquito, It generally takes between three and 14 days for the disease to develop. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 80 percent of infected people are asymptomatic (no symptoms), but 20 percent will develop fever, headache, and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases - about 1 in 150 - the virus can cause severe complications as it spreads to the brain - like encephalitis or meningitis - which may lead to paralysis, long-term disability, or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People over the age of 60 are at greater risk for severe illness if they are infected, as are those with with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific treatment for the virus or vaccine, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10941781/Could-monkeypox-West-Nile-Virus.html"&gt;80 percent of cases are mild&lt;/a&gt;, where sufferers may experience flu-like symptoms or rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, patients have reported paralysis and memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prospero Rangel, 78, beat cancer but was left relearning how to walk after contracting West Nile virus last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So far, there have been 51 reported human cases of West Nile virus so far this year across the US.

In the testes, the receptor would usually be activated by the insertion of a "key" — a vitamin A metabolite — but the drug stops this key from clicking into place. That, in turn, prevents the chain reaction that ends with sperm being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a compound with this effect required the scientists to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/newsreleases/2022/march/non-hormonal-pill-could-soon-expand-mens-birth-control-options.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/newsreleases/2022/march/non-hormonal-pill-could-soon-expand-mens-birth-control-options.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;closely examine the structure of the receptor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it's bound to its key, as well as test dozens of molecules to see which could block the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preclinical tests with male lab mice, the drug "elicited profound effects" on sperm production. It triggered reversible infertility within four weeks of use, showing 99% effectiveness at preventing pregnancy in the female mice the treated males mated with. When taken off the drug, the male mice's fertility was restored within about four to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests in nonhuman primates returned similar results, with sperm counts falling dramatically within two weeks of starting the drug and fully recovering within 10 to 15 weeks of stopping the drug. These preclinical tests set the stage for the recent clinical trial in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial included 16 males ages 32 to 59, all of whom had previously undergone vasectomies. This was done out of an abundance of caution, in case the experimental drug was to have any lasting impacts on fertility, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.malecontraceptive.org/yourchoice-therapeutics.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.malecontraceptive.org/yourchoice-therapeutics.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nadja Mannowetz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and chief science officer of YourChoice Therapeutics, told Scientific American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split into groups who received either &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;placebo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pills or a low or high dose of the drug. Most of the participants took the pill only after a period of fasting, but a subset were also given doses after a large meal, to see if that affected levels of the drug in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the doses and conditions tested, the levels of the drug in the body reached decent levels, but Mannowetz anticipates that, if approved, the final dose would be closest to the highest one tested: 180 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the animal study and the human trial results suggest that the approved pill would likely be taken once a day, but further trials will confirm that dosing. And although no notable side effects emerged in this small trial, future trials with larger study cohorts will still need to monitor for these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The positive results from this first clinical trial laid the groundwork for a second trial, where men receive YCT-529 for 28 days and 90 days, to study safety and changes in sperm parameters," the study authors wrote in their paper. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06542237?intr=YCT-529&amp;amp;rank=2" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06542237?intr=YCT-529&amp;amp;rank=2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;That trial is already underway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and again is looking at males who have already had vasectomies or who have made a firm decision not to father children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-CkahAZt3SAkbygj5u7wyTX-NPOIhd0jE6Qk008TmmhOtNqBjiS50ZLt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-CkahAZt3SAkbygj5u7wyTX-NPOIhd0jE6Qk008TmmhOtNqBjiS50ZLt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 38.4million Americans have diabetes, with the vast majority — around 37million — having type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition where the body can't use the insulin it produces, a hormone used to control blood sugar, leading to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This differs from type 1 diabetes, which is caused by the immune system attacking islet cells that make insulin, causing blood sugar levels to spike. The disease is typically diagnosed by testing the blood for characteristic antibodies against islet cells, indicating the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, a similar analysis was repeated on 107 Americans of sub-Saharan African background with type 1 diabetes. It found 55 percent of them tested negative for typical type 1 diabetes antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the study, the team led by the UK's University of Exeter said: 'These findings support the common existence of a non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient subtype of diabetes among children and young adults with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[This] is different from classic autoimmune type 1 diabetes, and does not have features consistent with type 2 diabetes or malnutrition-associated diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, alternative causes must be considered in this group of individuals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are not sure what may cause this version of diabetes, but said it might be linked to malnutrition in early life, which could cause cells to become less sensitive to the hormone insulin, which helps to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suggested it may be due to certain genetic variations in sub-Saharan African populations that are not present in white groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows estimates for global diabetes cases. It is predicted that the number of people with the condition will more than double by the year 2050 compared to 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Blood samples were collected from type 1 diabetics in the US and Africa from 2007 to 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the US, an estimated nearly 10 percent — or 167,000 — are black. It is not clear what proportion of these can trace their roots back to Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first part of the study, participants were recruited from Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half were female, all were black, and participants were diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 15 years on average. They all also had a healthy body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For participants from Cameroon and Uganda, blood samples were collected from patients who had visited private or public hospitals between 2019 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were analyzed for the presence of antibodies that would indicate the presence of type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To expand the dataset, the researchers also included participants from South Africa who had their blood tested for the same antibodies between 2007 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A total of 312 participants, or 35 percent, tested positive for the antibodies, while the remaining 582 tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, the researchers extracted data from the SEARCH database, which collects data on young people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They extracted information on 3,000 participants, including 2,602 from a white ethnic background and 429 from a black ethnic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the 107 recorded as being from a Sub-Saharan African background by the database, 55 percent or 59 participants did not test positive for the typical antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And among those from a black background, 65 participants or 15 percent tested negative for the antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said a similar pattern was not detected among those from a white ethnic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dana Dabelea, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado and co-author of the study, said: 'The identification of this type 1 diabetes in Sub-Saharan African populations and among individuals of African ancestry in the US suggests a potential ancestral or genetic link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the need to consider alternative etiologies in this group and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms may provide important insights for future prevention and treatment strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A simple brain scan in your 40s can reveal how long you may have to live, depending on how fast &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14915507/Belly-fat-health-risk-live-longer.html"&gt;your body is aging.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Duke University have discovered that MRI brain imaging during midlife can accurately determine the pace someone is aging biologically, helping doctors to predict the onset of several diseases &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14743425/kitchen-task-fueling-dementia-epidemic-microplastics.html"&gt;including Alzheimer's.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biological aging refers to how quickly your body is aging compared to your actual age, which can affect your health and how long you might live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this study, the researchers tied faster aging to physical changes in the brain that are usually seen in elderly adults, especially those experiencing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists developed a tool called the DunedinPACN, which takes a single scan and calculates the patient's 'Pace of Aging' by analyzing factors like surface area, gray matter volume, and the size of specific brain regions like the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers trained their new tool on the brain scans of 860 people in the Dunedin Study, giving the device its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results revealed that people determined to be aging at the fastest rates were 18 percent more likely to be diagnosed with a chronic disease within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, these 'fast agers' were 40 percent more likely to die within that timeframe compared to those aging more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An MRI scan can now tell how fast you're aging by revealing the physical changes in your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those with more fluid and a smaller hippocampus had brains far older than the average 45-year-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said: 'What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife and it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DunedinPACN revealed that people whose brain scans showed faster aging did worse on memory and thinking tests and had more shrinkage in the hippocampus, a key region tied to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smaller hippocampal volume was linked to faster cognitive decline, while larger ventricle volumes (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) was associated with worse health after middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Faster agers were also more likely to develop health problems like frailty, heart attacks, lung disease, or strokes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The way we age as we get older is quite distinct from how many times we've traveled around the sun,' Hariri said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study author added that several computer algorithms have been created to serve as so-called 'aging clocks' but these programs typically rely on data from people of all ages, taken at a single point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00897-z"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, focused on participants at age 45, creating more uniformity in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A software called FreeSurfer was used to process the brain scans and measure 315 different brain features, including cortical thickness, how thick the outer layer of the brain (the cortex) is. Thinner areas of the cortex might suggest faster aging or wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fast agers were 18 percent more likely to develop chronic diseases, and 40 percent more likely to die sooner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The link between aging of the brain and body are pretty compelling,' Hariri added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor added that the connection between Pace of Aging and dementia was just as strong across different racial and economic backgrounds in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the Dunedin Study included participants who were low-income and non-White, and lived everywhere from Latin America to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MRI scans also measured factors like gray-white matter signal intensity ratio, which compares how bright gray matter looks to white matter (the brain's wiring that connects different areas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A change in this ratio can show differences in brain tissue health, like how well the brain is holding up as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers noted that the size of a person's hippocampus can also shrink with age or from diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, a smaller hippocampus might signal faster aging or higher dementia risk, especially among people who are only in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Ventricles, the fluid-filled spaces in the brain that help cushion it, often get bigger when the brain tissue around them is shrinking - another sign of advanced aging or brain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dementia was the main threat discovered in faster aging brains, as it increased the risk of cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Duke team then examined the brain scans of 624 people ranging in age from 52 to 89 who took part in the North American study of risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They determined that the fastest agers &lt;span&gt;were 60 percent more likely to develop dementia in their later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast agers also began to suffer from memory and thinking issues sooner than those who found to be aging slower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These slow agers had brains that looked younger and healthier than expected, like having a 30-year-old's brain in a 45-year-old body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their brains featured a thicker cortex or larger hippocampus and showed fewer signs of wear and tear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were also less likely to develop chronic diseases, meaning they typically had longer lifespans than the fast agers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the team saw the results, 'our jaws just dropped to the floor,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But you don’t have to overhaul your entire diet or break the bank to start supporting your heart. Keeping just a few simple &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in your pantry can make it easier to add important nutrients to your everyday meals and snacks. We asked cardiologists for their must-have pantry staples, and chances are you already have a few of them on your shelf. Here’s what they recommend keeping stocked. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what oil to grab for roasting vegetables, whisking up marinades and dressings or finishing your pasta, olive oil can be a heart-healthy choice. "I recommend keeping some delicious olive oil close at hand and using it as your primary cooking oil, but also to drizzle it on each of your meals throughout the day," says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/locations/specialty-centers/scripps-shiley-pavilion/scripps-center-for-integrative-medicine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Epstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has an extensive history of research supporting its role in improving cardiovascular health. A 2022 meta-analysis of 13 studies with over 865,000 participants found a strong relationship between olive oil consumption and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For every 5-gram (about 1 teaspoon) increase in olive oil per day, they found a 4% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The best nutrition evidence we have supports the Mediterranean diet, which has been tested in several randomized controlled trials and shown to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death by 30 percent," says Epstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The liberal use of olive oil may be a key part of the puzzle, with its high levels of anti-inflammatory polyphenols, antioxidants and oleic acid. While any olive oil will offer some benefit, extra virgin olive oil is highest in antioxidant and bioactive plant compounds that may offer additional benefits to your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legume-based-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legume-Based Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to skip pasta, even on a heart-healthy diet. "One food I always keep stocked in my pantry is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7958987/best-legume-pastas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;legume-based pasta&lt;/a&gt;, such as pasta made from edamame and mung bean, lentils, chickpeas or black beans," says &lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Belardo, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Pasta made from legumes is typically higher in protein and fiber than wheat pasta, and can be much more filling. When it comes to heart health, eating more beans and bean-based foods is a safe bet. Multiple studies link legume consumption to improvements in lipid profiles and a reduced risk of heart disease, including one study suggesting that adults who eat legumes four times per week have a 22 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease than those who only eat them once each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to the high amount of soluble fiber found in legumes, which effectively lowers LDL cholesterol and supports steady blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If eating whole beans several times a week feels like a big leap from where you’re at, legume-based pasta can be a simple and approachable switch. "It’s nutrient-dense, easy to prepare and aligned with the principles of evidence-based heart-healthy eating," says Belardo, who emphasizes legume-based pasta’s positive impact on glycemic control, satiety and overall metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning bowl of oatmeal may be doing more for your heart than you realize. Oats are rich in soluble fiber, beta-glucans and anti-inflammatory compounds like phytosterols, all of which help lower cholesterol and support healthy weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Oats, like all whole, plant-based foods, contain plant sterols, a group of substances made in plants that block cholesterol absorption in the digestive tract," says &lt;a href="https://www.steponefoods.com/pages/about-elizabeth-klodas-md" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Between soluble fiber binding cholesterol in the gut, plant sterols reducing absorption and beta-glucans positively influencing the gut microbiome and cholesterol metabolism, oats are a triple threat against heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just be sure to choose whole, minimally processed oats. Research shows they retain more of their fiber, beta-glucans and heart-healthy phytochemicals compared to ultra-processed or highly-sweetened oats and oat-based foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, between overnight oats, hot oatmeal, granola, oatmeal pancakes and smoothies, there are endless ways to enjoy them!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart-healthy eating doesn’t have to include a total pantry makeover. The foods cardiologists always have in their own pantries include simple staples like olive oil, oats and legume-based pasta. Regularly including these foods in a balanced, overall healthy diet may help lower cholesterol, support a healthy weight and protect your heart well into the future. &lt;br&gt;

On average, the difference in brain aging between men and women was small, about 2.5 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4933" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t yet know exactly why, but this fits with other research suggesting that men may be more affected by certain types of stress or health challenges,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e68aa2" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/protect-memory-education-key-new-science-suggests-rcna69400" target="_blank"&gt;Brains shrink as people age&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/obesity-can-cause-changes-brain-similar-alzheimers-study-suggests-rcna66555" target="_blank"&gt;gray matter shrinks prematurely&lt;/a&gt;, it can lead to memory loss or judgment problems, although the pandemic study doesn't show whether people with structural changes will eventually develop cognitive deficits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c63e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The study wasn’t designed to pinpoint specific causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff679" class="body-graf"&gt;“But it is likely that the cumulative experience of the pandemic—including psychological stress, social isolation, disruptions in daily life, reduced activity and wellness—contributed to the observed changes,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. “In this sense, the pandemic period itself appears to have left a mark on our brains, even in the absence of infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfaf3" class="body-graf"&gt;An earlier study on how &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/covid-lockdowns-teen-brains-aged-prematurely-rcna169966" target="_blank"&gt;teenagers' brains were affected by the pandemic &lt;/a&gt;discovered a similar result.  The 2024 research from the University of Washington found that boys’ brains had aged the equivalent of 1.4 years extra during the pandemic, while girls aged an extra 4.2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391e18" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, Mohammadi-Nejad and his team turned to the UK Biobank, a massive database which launched in 2006, to determine whether the pandemic had any impact on people’s brains. The database has been keeping track of anonymous health data from 500,000 volunteers who were recruited between 2006 and 2010, when the participants were between 40 to 69 years old. Thus far, the biobank has collected 100,000 whole body scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a70aa7" class="body-graf"&gt;To develop a baseline model of normal aging, to compare with what might have occurred during the pandemic years, the researchers used imaging data from 15,334 healthy individuals that had been collected prior to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-724c41" class="body-graf"&gt;“We used this large dataset to teach our model what typical, healthy brain ageing looks like across the adult lifespan,” Mohammadi-Nejad explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15e1dc" class="body-graf"&gt;Next the researchers turned to a group of 996 participants who had two scans, the second taking place on average 2.3 years after the first. Of these participants, 564 had both scans prior to the pandemic, which helped the artificial intelligence learn how the brain changes when there is no pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f875b" class="body-graf"&gt;The other 432 had a second scan after the start of the pandemic, mostly between 2021 and 2022, allowing the researchers to investigate how the pandemic might have affected  brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcb5f4" class="body-graf"&gt;Although these second scans were done later in the pandemic, “they reflect brain changes that likely happened during the height of the pandemic, when people experienced the most disruption,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-799bfd" class="body-graf"&gt;Other research has suggested that environmental factors might cause a person’s brain to age prematurely. One study conducted in the Antarctic tied living in relative isolation to brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a301c8" class="body-graf"&gt;“The most intriguing finding in this study is that only those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed any cognitive deficits, despite structural aging,” said Jacqueline Becker, a clinical neuropsychologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “This speaks a little to the effects of the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;And that may eventually help explain syndromes, such as long Covid and chronic fatigue, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8d4ec" class="body-graf"&gt;What we don’t know from this study is whether the structural brain changes observed in people who didn’t get Covid will amount to any observable changes in brain function, Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e516" class="body-graf"&gt;Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the study is a compelling narrative, but “still a hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22eadf" class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t show whether the accelerated aging seen in people who didn’t get Covid will persist long term, said Brickman, who was not involved with the study&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70e76c" class="body-graf"&gt;If the brain indeed was changed by the pandemic in meaningful ways, then people might counter those changes by doing things that are healthy for the brain, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8c84f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We know that exercise is good for the brain and keeping blood pressure at a healthy level, for example. We know that sleep and social interactions are important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 19:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNOUh5VVlkZXdMZEswU3Z2RlZ0UDlIaHc3RWJSSnpzNTdmejBCX0pLeEppWnhCS29GZ1FKSWJ3c2NaejZqRHZVc2I0STlTdXluU1E5Q2Z0cHZrdVNEVEpUaFJBNWQ5dmh4U2pMNkF1VE9zNTJ2U3FwM19sUFp3N1ZzTWFPTEZJMmVYeGdiLVpxY01pR1JBSTlsdi1CSXRKT2PSAVZBVV95cUxPNktOSlliY3dwenByTFc1WHpUVkRaWWFaTE9nd3U0UExTNWJYSEdodjR0TUxHVEdKaXlNd2t4cHdZUXo2bERVczBVV214cXJqNEd3RDZvZw</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员说，在南卡罗来纳州米德兰兹郡确诊的食脑变形虫感染-该州 | Brain-eating amoeba infection confirmed in SC Midlands, health officials say - The State</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5tOU9HRXpBajNhNlhFMmI4NjM1ZWVuTDFVZHo4U29KLWpZOTQwX2k1cUZpdEdUSHItMGVnbFVVRFo1X0ZhUjlVcXRad2w3VzNSekppUWwtREgzc2l5T0ExQWgwclhpSHd20gFoQVVfeXFMUE1IRWZ5azVmS241Q05tQk54cVFKSWtDMzhwal82TzNCR3QxWldpaE9BSEliOE1zYzN2eG1xUDRBYVFyQXBJRmFReFg4eGU3bmROZEMzMG5NNXpZYi1qc0FYTU50S1JkdEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div class="lead-item "&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person in the Midlands has died from a brain-eating amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patient at the Prisma Health Children’s Hospital in the Midlands recently died from the infection, Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the hospital confirmed. The hospital consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when responding to the case, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health became aware of the case the week of July 7 but noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Naegleria fowleri amoeba&lt;/a&gt; is not required to be reported to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person’s condition,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency did not name the body of water the infection came from or any specific details about the infected individual, citing federal and state privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said he was also unable to specify where the infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is common within warm freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers as well as in soil. However, infections are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually start within a week of infection, and they include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to South Carolina’s &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/insect-or-animal-borne-disease/naegleria-fowleri-ameba" target="_self" rel="Follow"&gt;publich health website&lt;/a&gt;. As the illness develops, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations can occur. The infection is fatal in 95% of cases, with death occurring between one and 12 days after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from Naegleria fowleri were only reported three times in South Carolina from 2010 to 2022. Across the entire country, there were 40 cases in that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid infection, the state public health department advises to avoid water activities when the temperature is high and the water level is low, to hold one’s nose shut when jumping into the water and to avoid digging in or stirring up sediment around warm, fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 22, 2025 at 2:57 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA just&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href='https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm"&amp;gt;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;issued a standard paperwork thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Register today. It is a note about some questionnaire they want people to fill out egarding special NASA events that they went to. Sounds innocent enough and it is good that NASA would want feedback. Except NASA states that they are only worried about less than 0.01% of the American public and that they are going to spend more than one government employee’s annual hours looking at an expected 650 responses? What about looking into what the rest of the nation thinks about how ‘Great’ NASA is or should be? &lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://nasawatch.com/education/nasas-0-01-outreach-plan/"&gt;more below&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-20173"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The note says &lt;em&gt;“The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena.”&lt;/em&gt; Sounds good to me. Agencies get asked to do this sort of paperwork all the time – for paperwork reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there is the whole data thing. Google just told me that there are ~347,000,000 Americans and that ~138,000,000 of them will file tax returns. Every taxpayer directly or indirectly funds NASA. All of these people fund all of NASA. But how do they benefit from that? Many ways of course – even though NASA Is woefully incapable of explaining that to rank and file citizenry – even after 60 years of trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one of those &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new Executive Orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says that you can get in big trouble if you have regulations that hinder America or whatever. OK, so why is NASA worrying about what the &lt;em&gt;“affected public of 35,300” &lt;/em&gt;(i.e. a tenth of one percent of all Americans) thinks about some fancy NASA space party thing they went to – but not query the 99.98% of Americans who get less or nothing from NASA outreach? And they are only expecting a ~2% response rate from the &lt;em&gt;“affected public”&lt;/em&gt;? And they expect to spend more than one FTE (4,046 hours) figuring out what these 650 thought?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course NASA will argue back (if they bother to respond, that is) that NASA has all kinds of outreach events and they have big social media accounts and lots of news clippings and they won an Emmy etc. But ask NASA for metrics i.e. numbers, data, etc. – that is, how many real, actual people outside of their little space bubble were reached for a certain mission; what that interaction(s) were delivered; how the response is measured; what their media metrics for video and social media are; and how many students were contacted in a school year. Ask for that and you get an email saying something useless in 3 sentences. NASA either does not know or does not care to tell you if they do know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better yet, ask NASA for their actual outreach plan – the thing that guides who they reach out to and how they do it – and you get nothing in response. There is no plan. Then ask them about data capture and analysis for all outreach efforts i.e. what grades, schools/universities, zip codes, congressional districts, stated interest topics, geographic areas etc. and they either send you old partial data gibberish or do not repsond. And NASA has no follow-up plan for whatever audiences they do manage to reach, and measure, and understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA does astonishing stuff. No kidding. It sets the standard for all others. On one hand The agency has a global reach that exceeds that of most governments and large corporations. But NASA fails to grasp what that global reach means and the vast soft power opportunity it offers (especially if you want to counter China or someone else). Yes, flashy graphics and pretty pictures get you a momentary media sugar high. But NASA has not a clue how to take all that it has done, build upon it synergistically, and maximize its value to everyone who either pays for it and/or benefits from it. There is no long term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet NASA Is being pushed to aspire to be “Great Again” or that “NASA Is Back” or it will continue to be great etc. while other nations see the same value to space exploration and are surging ahead, nipping at NASA’s heels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If NASA falls behind it is our own collective fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. In order to organize effective outreach events and registration opportunities for members of the public, it is necessary to collect information from perspective guests and those that will check-in the guests at events. The NASA Special Events System is a tool to allow invitees to register for and check-in to NASA event opportunities (launch viewing, agency engagements, etc.) in a single location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Methods of Collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NASA Special Events tool is a web-based application on a Salesforce platform. The intent of using electronic collection techniques is to increase the accuracy of information gathered and to streamline the process for guests and workforce alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Carson City Health and Human Services (CCHHS) is reporting a confirmed case of Lyme disease. The suspected exposure was related to outdoor activities or a workplace exposure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individual did not report traveling outside of Northern Nevada in the four weeks prior to the start of symptoms, so the exact location of the tick bite cannot be determined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease occurs when an infected tick bites a human. The tick must be attached for at least 24-48 hours to transmit the illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A characteristic skin rash can also appear called erythema migrans. This is commonly known as a “bull’s-eye rash.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically appear between 7-10 days following exposure to a tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of Lyme disease, it’s important to minimize contact with ticks and their habitats, especially when in areas of dense vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect yourself:&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear long-sleeved shirts and closed-toe shoes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pre-treat clothing with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Apply EPA-registered insect repellent to uncovered skin.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check skin and clothing for ticks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shower within two hours of being outdoors to wash away ticks before they can bite and attach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When hiking, stay in the middle of cleared paths and avoid brush and grass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect your pets:&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your vet about tick prevention treatments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Limit their time in tick-heavy areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Minimize exposure by keeping pets leashed on trails.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check for ticks after being outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is only spread by ticks and not from person to person. Contact your medical provider for questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Some scientists have even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called inflammation&lt;/a&gt; “the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and what fights it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle, it responds with acute inflammation – an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress, acute inflammation can become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24468642/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;low mood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25123210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16525580/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/inflammation-depression-mind-body" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing number of products and routines – like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/19/what-skincare-experts-do-to-their-skin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red light masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;de-puffing regimens&lt;/a&gt; – claim to fight the signs of inflammation. Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a vegetable-heavy Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412134/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3914936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/30/inflation-healthy-food-eating-america" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/18/climate-diet-food-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access issues&lt;/a&gt; can get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768696/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476783/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; says chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/prescribed-time-in-nature-linked-to-improvements-in-anxiety-depression-and-blood-pressure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities.

But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr. Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328581/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;series of Li’s studies&lt;/a&gt; show that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; similarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. One &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-20-minute-nature-break-relieves-stress?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="engage-with-art-and-music" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Engage with art and music&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Art can also promote relief from chronic stress. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5004743/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/18/truth-about-stress-benefits-of-the-good-kind-exercise-that-makes-it-worse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stress are related to a loss of control&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167611/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779734/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol. Researchers at the University of Florida have been documenting the &lt;a href="https://arts.ufl.edu/site/assets/files/188411/epiarts_table_final.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health benefits of engaging with the arts&lt;/a&gt;, with some studies suggesting just one to three hours of related activity per week can reduce risk of depression and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr. Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In his co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3041" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like CRP and IL-6, and increase &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5883991/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, like running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; finds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-other-people" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Support other people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.837379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;late neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; compares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130107/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, including increased &lt;a href="https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/getting-under-the-skin-social-isolation-and-biological-markers-in" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt; and dysregulated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19744794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, studies link &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15473629/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high levels of social support &lt;/a&gt;to lower cortisol, and link social activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229892/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036113/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;giving social support&lt;/a&gt; to lower pro-inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="experience-awe" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Experience ‘awe’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So how can you encounter awe?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr6h00173b775qxm39ky@published"&gt;I am a voracious reader of your column. I love the content, advice, and inspiration it provides me. I am writing in for help with a problem I am having. My rational side knows the answer, but my emotional side will not get with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr8f00183b77f93x85fd@published"&gt;I am female and my partner is male. We began our relationship hot and heavy. He reawakened in me a connection with my sexual self that has been powerful and liberating. I am in my mid-40s, perimenopausal, and still I WANT to have sex as often as possible because of how good it feels to be desired and connected to a man that I love.  We have been very adventurous. I have a vivid imagination and fantasize and masturbate regularly. I always prefer him. Here is the problem…&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rram00193b77dm16bz7w@published"&gt;His libido is vanishing. He is also in his 40s. He has an incredibly stressful job, custody troubles, substance abuse, and past sexual trauma. He is a complicated, yet simple man, and we love each other very much. I communicate endlessly about his diminishing initiative to be intimate and how it makes me feel. This then turns into him feeling guilt and shame for not being able to provide what I need, and he worries I will leave him for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9mgfku000b3b7820xbz79a@published"&gt;He is finally taking erectile dysfunction medication, but he seems to never be in the mood to initiate. I feel like I am badgering him. I know he is tired and stressed, but he is so sexy to me that I want him ALL the time, and the pressure I put on him only makes it worse. I try to tell him that I don’t need his penis to work for me to be sexually satisfied. I just need him to want me the way he used to. He says he will go to therapy with me, but not alone. We talk about our relationship issues, but he is exhausted by the fact that it always comes back to sex and my constant need for it. Non-monogamy is not really for us (although we have discussed my fantasy of bringing another male to the bedroom). I know I need to back off and give him some grace. It is his body, and I need to learn how to be patient. Still, my feelings of rejection and neglect are overwhelming sometimes. How can I reconcile my understanding of what he is physically/mentally going through with my overwhelming feelings of hurt and frustration?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrja001c3b77y2vef73g@published"&gt;As a longtime reader, I’m guessing you’re aware of my philosophy that feelings can’t be forced—whether that’s you feeling satisfied, or your partner feeling desire. He probably does want, on some level, to want you the way he used to. You’re absolutely correct that patience, space, and grace are the best way to create conditions that are conducive to your partner feeling desire toward you. You know that men often deal with feelings of inadequacy around erectile dysfunction, and may have a hard time with their libido being lower than they feel it should be or than it used to be. And you’re aware that most of us worry, at some point, about whether our partners might leave us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrlx001d3b77zlzk5vhc@published"&gt;As an aside, absolutely do not pursue bringing in a third partner at this time. It’s too combustible. Even discussing the fantasy has a chance of adding more shame and pressure to what your partner is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rroa001e3b77u6nmbhpe@published"&gt;Are you sure that the neglect you’re feeling is entirely related to sex? Your partner is juggling a lot, and I’m wondering whether you’ve perhaps enjoyed the sexual liberation you describe so thoroughly that you may not have noticed intimacy, connection, and support being somewhat absent in other areas. So take a long, sober look at the relationship. Do you get the amount of touch you need outside of sex? Is he emotionally available to a degree that is sufficient for you? Do you have ways of connecting outside of physical intimacy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrqc001f3b77tl8l28dj@published"&gt;If everything else is healthy and happy, what can you do to increase the sexual gratification you get from your solo time? Sometimes this looks like adding props and media—a new vibrator, some different fantasies—and sometimes this looks like a kind of mindful minimalism. Whatever you’re doing right now, explore other directions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrsk001g3b77h73b4v38@published"&gt;As for reconciling what your mind knows with what you feel and what your body wants, therapy is absolutely an option. It may help to simply accept the fact that we sometimes have to hold disparate perspectives. Talking it out with trusted friends is another time-tested way of dealing with difficult feelings. Have a commiseration session—whether you’re all navigating similar hiccups or having different challenges, a group complaint night has a way of helping contextualize what we’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrup001h3b7790eqxj9n@published"&gt;Lastly—and I know this is a wild thing for a sex advice columnist to say to someone who is fairly freshly sexually liberated—it might help to rein in your libido. What can you do to focus on other aspects of life? Or to sit with arousal and desire without letting it run free? This might give you the reprieve you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001s3b77y7zbqgqi@published"&gt;I am a 25-year-old woman who is into being a dom, as it serves as a major turn-on for me. The trouble is that I find that many (if not all) of the guys I go out with are decidedly not keen on the idea of playing the role of a sub. Am I going to have to restrict myself to circles with men who are into being subs if I want to satisfy my kink? Or should I try to see if I can convince someone who isn’t really into it to go along?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001v3b77w35kn115@published"&gt;Take a moment to look at your last question: ”convince someone who isn’t really into it.” That’s always a dodgy proposition when we’re talking about sex, and doubly so when the sex involves power exchange, restraint, or pain. Your potential lovers are people who deserve respect, autonomy, and care. Functional BDSM absolutely requires that the submissive’s boundaries and rights be respected—if that isn’t the case, it’s assault or coercion at best, and rape at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7x001w3b77w417lqpc@published"&gt;When you question whether you’ll have to restrict yourself to circles of men who identify as subs, I imagine you’re wondering whether BDSM clubs and FetLife are your only dating options. While you’ll certainly have a more efficient time finding men who are open to submitting in those spaces, there are other avenues open to you. It’ll help to define what being a dom means to you, and what you’re looking for in a sub. Is this more about psychological role play? Service? Are sadism and masochism part of the equation? What do you need out of the experience to feel satisfied? Let’s say it’s about service—is a defined scenario important? Or will someone whose love language is “acts of service” and loves letting you sit on their face suffice? And does any dynamic need to be pervasive throughout the relationship, present in every sexual and flirtation interaction, or can it be confined to specific sexual moments?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7z001x3b77rszlzfv3@published"&gt;Once you’ve got the clarity outlined above, you might look in places like Feeld, which tend to attract people who are, broadly speaking, sexually open. Or attend local events that are marketed as “sex positive” and meet people there. Negotiating relationships with a power dynamic is complex, which is why you’ll need details about exactly what you need to be fulfilled. Be prepared for lots of folks to say, “No, thank you.” That’s part of the reality of dating, whether the detail we’re navigating is a sexual interest, a personality quirk, or the demands of any number of careers. And, if it turns out that your interests are precise and narrow enough that you do essentially need to focus your search in classic BDSM spaces, ask yourself why that feels like confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94tayb00283b77zpp7uopi@published"&gt;My boyfriend of three months, “Alex,” refuses to go down on me.  He says it’s nothing personal; he’s just never been into performing oral sex. Getting eaten out is one of my favorite bedroom activities. Should I try to convince Alex to give it a chance, or is this my cue to walk away?&lt;/p&gt;

State the situation plainly: Receiving oral sex is important to your satisfaction, you won’t stay in a relationship where it isn’t part of the sex, and you’re hoping that he’ll be willing to give it a try with you, even though you know he’s never enjoyed it before. Whatever his answer is, accept that and make your choices accordingly with as little turmoil as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol takes around 24 hours to completely leave your body, so you may start noticing improvements after just one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol makes you need to urinate more often, causing dehydration. But your body can absorb a glass of water almost immediately, so once alcohol is out of your system, alcohol dehydration is reduced, improving digestion, brain function and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also reduces the liver's ability to regulate blood sugar. Once alcohol leaves the system, blood sugar begins to normalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are a daily drinker you may feel a bit worse to start with while your body adjusts to not having alcohol in its system all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may initially notice disrupted sleep, mood changes, sweating or tremors. Most symptoms usually resolve in about a week without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one week &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy at first, it disrupts your sleep cycle. By the end of an alcohol-free week, you may notice you are more energetic in the mornings as a result of getting better quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the body's filter, the liver does much of the heavy lifting in processing alcohol and can be easily damaged even with moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is important for cleaning blood, processing nutrients and producing bile that helps with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can also regenerate quickly. If you have only mild damage in the liver, seven days may be enough to reduce liver fat and heal mild scarring and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small amounts of alcohol can impair brain functioning. So quitting can help improve brain health within a few days in light to moderate drinkers and within a month even for very heavy dependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one month &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can make managing mood harder and worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression. After a few weeks, most people start to feel better. Even very heavy drinkers report better mood after one to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As your sleep and mood improve you may also notice more energy and greater wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month of abstinence regular drinkers also report feeling more confident about making changes to how they drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may lose weight and body fat. Alcohol can trigger hunger reward systems, making us overeat or choose less healthy foods when drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even your skin will thank you. Alcohol can make you look older through dehydration and inflammation, which can be reversed when you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol irritates the gut and disrupts normal stomach functioning, causing bloating, indigestion, heartburn and diarrhea. These symptoms usually start to resolve within four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month of abstinence, insulin resistance – which can lead to high blood sugar – significantly reduces by 25 percent. Blood pressure also reduces (by six percent) and cancer-related growth factors declines, lowering your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It can take up to three days for the body to return to normal functioning following a two-day boozy drinking session, experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After six months &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver starts to repair within weeks. For moderate drinkers, damage to your liver could be fully reversed by six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, even heavy drinkers may notice they're better at fighting infections and feel healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one year or more &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol contributes to or causes a large number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and seven different types of cancer, as well as mental health issues. All of these risks can be reduced by quitting or cutting back on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol increases blood pressure. High blood pressure (hypertension) is the top risk factor for death in the world. A small 2mmHg increase in blood pressure above the normal range (120mmHG) increases death from stroke by 10 percent and from coronary artery disease by seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol to less than two drinks a day can reduce blood pressure significantly, reducing risk of stroke and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing blood pressure also reduces risk of kidney disease, eye problems and even erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With sustained abstinence, your risk of getting any type of cancer drops. One study looked at cancer risk for more than 4 million adults over three to seven years and found the risk of alcohol-related cancer dropped by 4 percent, even for light drinkers who quit. Reducing from heavy to moderate drinking reduced alcohol-related cancer risk by nine percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

Drinking at your current level puts you at risk of developing problems with your health and life in general, such as work and relationships. Consider cutting down (see below for tips).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;16-19:&lt;/span&gt; Higher risk of complications from alcohol. Cutting back on your own may be difficult at this level, as you may be dependent, so you may need professional help from your GP and/or a counsellor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;20 and over:&lt;/span&gt; Possible dependence. Your drinking is already causing you problems, and you could very well be dependent. You should definitely consider stopping gradually or at least reduce your drinking. You should seek professional help to ascertain the level of your dependence and the safest way to withdraw from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe dependence may need medically assisted withdrawal, or detox, in a hospital or a specialist clinic. This is due to the likelihood of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms in the first 48 hours needing specialist treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There is no cure but symptoms can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Triclosan, commonly found in antibacterial soap, deodorant, detergent and toothpaste, was widely used in personal hygiene products as an antibacterial and antifungal agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in 2016, the FDA limited its use in consumer products after determining it offered no added benefit over regular soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-d0b64540-666d-11f0-bbff-afffa5328c81"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; said manufacturers hadn't provided the data necessary to demonstrate the ingredient was both safe for daily use over a long period of time or any more effective than soap and water in preventing illnesses and the spread of certain infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And more recently, experts have raised concerns over triclosan's health impacts on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13831235/girls-start-puberty-early-chemical-exposure-NIH.html"&gt;the endocrine system&lt;/a&gt;, as well as its potential toxic effects on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the FDA's limitation, the Cleveland Clinic &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14716191/breast-cancer-toxic-toiletries-tumour-risk.html"&gt;notes that triclosan&lt;/a&gt; may still be present in certain toothpastes, deodorants, cosmetics, and detergents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kristen Bell first developed eczema during childhood. It went away but came back at the age of 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jessica Simpson has revealed she's dealt with eczema since she was a child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study tracked 347 mothers and their children from pregnancy through the children's 12th birthdays. Researchers measured triclosan levels in urine of the mother-child pairs up to age 5, with additional assessments at ages 8 and 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 6 months and 12 years of age, caregivers completed surveys reporting any allergy-related symptoms, such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, found that children with twice the levels of baseline triclosan in their urine - researchers did not reveal the baseline - were 23 percent more likely to report eczema symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This risk increased to nearly 40 percent by the time they were 8 to 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, children with double the urinary triclosan levels were 12 percent more likely to show allergy symptoms, such as sneezing or congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that among boys, every two-fold increase in triclosan levels in the mother's urine during pregnancy was linked to a 1.9 times risk of the child experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the same increase for young girls, the risk of reporting rhinitis symptoms was nine percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One hypothesis we have is that triclosan kills off helpful bacteria that live on our skin and in our bodies that help us form healthy immune responses,' said Hannah Laue, study author and assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Beyond Pesticides, which tracks chemicals in consumer products, triclosan has been found in mouthwashes, deodorants, skincare and body lotions made by Colgate, Murad, Arm and Hammer and Bath and Body Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be also found in clothes, cosmetics, kitchenware and humidifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Triclosan, commonly found in antibacterial soap, deodorant, detergent and toothpaste, was widely used in personal hygiene products as an antibacterial and antifungal agent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Triclosan is effective at killing many bacteria, fungi and viruses,' Laue said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While that's useful for extending product shelf life or reducing odors in athletic wear, it can be harmful to humans. Our bodies rely on beneficial microbes to aid digestion and protect against pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Exposure to triclosan may disrupt that healthy balance, leaving us more vulnerable to disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laue also noted that triclosan has the potential to disrupt hormonal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Some chemicals, including triclosan, can mimic or block hormones, potentially throwing essential systems into overdrive or shutting them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Triclosan has also been linked to reduced thyroid hormone levels, which are critical for healthy growth and development.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, triclosan affects levels of estrogen as well as androgen, the male sex hormone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Triclosan is &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779949/#:~:text=Previous%20studies%20suggested%20that%20triclosan,postnatal%20triclosan%20administration%20%5B13%5D."&gt;structurally very similar&lt;/a&gt; to thyroxine (T4), a hormone produced by the thyroid that governs crucial bodily processes including metabolism and growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that the compound competes with T4 for binding to proteins, which disrupts the distribution of hormones in the bloodstream. Triclosan may also mimic or block hormones secreted by the thyroid gland at crucial receptor sites, scrambling their signaling to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An analysis of rodent studies showed that as triclosan exposure increased, levels of T4 decreased, as well as levels of total triiodothyronine (T3), a more potent cousin of T4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound's affects on humans has not been studied extensively, but lab studies have shown its deleterious affects on animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results of previous human studies were inconsistent, though. While one US study linked triclosan to higher T3 in adolescents, others found lower free T4 in obese women and pregnant women in their third trimester.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When hormone levels are affected by triclosan, the metabolism might slow down, causing weight gain and fatigue. Thyroid dysfunction can also affect unborn babies, disrupting puberty and future fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endocrine disrupting chemicals are believed to play a role in the development of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study out in February found that women with moderate to high levels of triclosan in their urine, after accounting for their ages and lifestyles, had &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88765-z#Sec8"&gt;roughly 1.9 to 2.3 times&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to women with low levels of the compound in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And low levels of T3 and/or T4 trigger the release of thyroid-stimulating hormones  that can lead to an enlarged thyroid (commonly called a goiter) or lasting thyroid dysfunction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope that this will prompt companies to consider using safer antimicrobial chemicals or avoiding them altogether in their products,' Braun said. 'Some companies do offer products that are labeled "triclosan-free." But we need better regulations to protect people from harmful chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 15:42:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPc0xCQzNIMXk3dHdLSzQ3MHVON1VqeW1GNHk0RktPeUhWdmZFWGFodXdYb0NGSUh2elFJdTI1Y2psZFhUY0hXLTBlRWtic0NGSFhYTmk0MDNscl9INGFTa1pjc2R1ck81MUZ3eFBsdWk3ZFVpNzRfT3hTRl83WEREbi1kTERhUEJ0VXRZdmtXNzJRTEM4dVpIUDF3YldZVklXbUVvb0hoakE0NVVQa1Ffc9IBtgFBVV95cUxPY0FzQVFuaGRyblM3WERJa1FHTmhjVEpBbnhoaFFKbi0wSmNRZE9TZlRyejZ2UmtqT0VuLTBHc3FES3EzVUx2U21FbGFWMTc5UGY1bDRPTjhKaG4tTmNfR0Y1XzgyZzY5QkctbkxLaXBNYUJRVGNwUnpfblk5ZzVnWjdCN3hsVmtNbG0zRjhtajFieFZscnFIcDRTM3pJaGVGb0hHNmY5OWt4MExhbmQyc2ZGbC15dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
