Hospitals should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;diagnose or rule out cancer in 75% of cases within 28 days of urgent referral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;begin treatment in 96% of cases within another 31 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;ensure the whole journey takes no longer than 62 days in 85% of cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nearly one in four trusts have been missing all three targets over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some of the major regional cancer hubs say they are struggling with inherited waits. Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'We can't deliver care we want'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 for 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: "We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How best-performers are doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date. I said, that's a Saturday. The surgeon said, yes, I work Saturdays," laughs Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over in the chemotherapy ward there are more steps being taken to ease capacity issues. A new initiative - one of the first in England - is allowing patients on certain types of chemotherapy to be taught how to do the treatment for themselves at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Josephine Hoskins is one of them. She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon. "It's revolutionised things for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Moving patients like Josephine to 'at-home chemo' immediately opens up another slot for someone that needs more complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Determined to improve'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government said it was determined to improve waiting times. A new cancer strategy is expected to be published by the government early next year. It comes after cancer was named as a ‘core priority’ in the 10-year NHS plan published in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "Cancer care is a priority as we turn around more than a decade of neglect of our NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're working at pace to ensure patients get timely diagnoses and treatment -  building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70 million on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Sarah Scobie of the Nuffield Trust health think tank believes ministers will struggle to address the problems highlighted by the BBC analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The reality for the government is that it will be incredibly challenging to make meaningful progress on waiting times when finances are so tight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;About the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BBC News analysed official cancer waiting time statistics from NHS England, covering the 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS publishes data monthly, but we have analysed the performance over the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We looked at performance against the three national targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Trusts were ranked according to their performance on the 62-day measure, which covers the entire waiting time between urgent referral and starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;&lt;b id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Additional reporting by Jess Carr and Muskeen Liddar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:47:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9rRjhSTUc0bmVLQzdoSjczTzVob2lESEtWT3ZvYUd4aGZfS2hWYlJSbTNoUzJTb2dwZXhvVjlXYjAzNzRHS0VqaXQ1cl92a3NzZ3lGMG5rM0ZpZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE91VmV2RVE5UUxzWk9FNkx0c0VEWlE0ejBrd1ZwMmZXdzdkeEgxOEtmRXJsZzlwMGRlcmV2TTJvZ2Y2dmlQV1FDR1RkV3BEWmpUOGhrMFRhcXdGa0pQQ2Jn</guid></item><item><title>几乎所有NHS医院都缺少癌症目标-您是其中之一吗？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdpqvpj3lo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Nearly all NHS trusts failing to hit cancer target&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 xGeVU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 djOqvY"&gt;Chloe Hayward, Nick Triggle &amp;amp;

Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'We can't deliver care we want'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 for 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: "We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How best-performers are doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date.

The surgeon said, yes, I work Saturdays," laughs Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over in the chemotherapy ward there are more steps being taken to ease capacity issues. A new initiative - one of the first in England - is allowing patients on certain types of chemotherapy to be taught how to do the treatment for themselves at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Josephine Hoskins is one of them. She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon. "It's revolutionised things for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Moving patients like Josephine to 'at-home chemo' immediately opens up another slot for someone that needs more complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Determined to improve'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government said it was determined to improve waiting times. A new cancer strategy is expected to be published by the government early next year. It comes after cancer was named as a ‘core priority’ in the 10-year NHS plan published in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "Cancer care is a priority as we turn around more than a decade of neglect of our NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're working at pace to ensure patients get timely diagnoses and treatment -  building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70 million on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Sarah Scobie of the Nuffield Trust health think tank believes ministers will struggle to address the problems highlighted by the BBC analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The reality for the government is that it will be incredibly challenging to make meaningful progress on waiting times when finances are so tight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;About the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BBC News analysed official cancer waiting time statistics from NHS England, covering the 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS publishes data monthly, but we have analysed the performance over the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We looked at performance by acute trusts against the three national targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Trusts were ranked according to their performance on the 62-day measure, which covers the entire waiting time between urgent referral and starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;&lt;b id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Additional reporting by Jess Carr and Muskeen Liddar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:47:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9rRjhSTUc0bmVLQzdoSjczTzVob2lESEtWT3ZvYUd4aGZfS2hWYlJSbTNoUzJTb2dwZXhvVjlXYjAzNzRHS0VqaXQ1cl92a3NzZ3lGMG5rM0ZpZw</guid></item><item><title>研究将牙龈疾病与大脑中的白质损伤联系起来- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/study-links-gum-disease-with-white-matter-damage-in-the-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Poor health in one part of the body often leads to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-yet-again"&gt;problems elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. A new study links gum disease with an increased risk of damage to the brain's white matter, which transmits signals around the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings aren't conclusive, but they suggest that persistent inflammation in the mouth could be harming the brain as well – and that practicing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-re-probably-brushing-your-teeth-wrong-here-are-4-expert-tips-for-better-dental-health"&gt;good oral hygiene&lt;/a&gt; may benefit white matter in the brain as well as gums and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study, led by a team from the University of South Carolina, were particularly interested in white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). These are key markers of cerebral small vessel disease or CSVD, which affects the brain's blood vessels and increases the chances of a stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows a link between gum disease and white matter hyperintensities suggesting oral health may play a role in brain health that we are only beginning to understand," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5289"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Souvik Sen, vascular neurologist at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dentist-visit-might-have-triggered-rare-brain-bleed-in-patient"&gt;dental exams&lt;/a&gt; and brain scans for 1,143 adult participants, finding that those with gum disease, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;, (800 of the group) had a higher average volume of WMHs: 2.83 percent of total brain volume, compared to 2.52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg" alt="Dental checkup" class="wp-image-180674 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Good oral hygiene could be linked to brain health.

Even so, the statistics are suggestive enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease is preventable and treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen. "If future studies confirm this link, it could offer a new avenue for reducing cerebral small vessel disease by targeting oral inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being associated with CSVD, WMHs also often increase &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;with age&lt;/a&gt;. Their presence is thought to indicate underlying injuries in the brain, which can have an impact on abilities like balance, memory recall, and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this might be exacerbated by gum disease isn't clear, but there's a growing amount of evidence that &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/inflammation-and-brain-health"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – where the body's immune system goes into harmful overdrive in an attempt to protect itself – can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crohns-disease-scientists-say-bacteria-in-the-mouth-may-be-a-cause"&gt;spread between conditions&lt;/a&gt; and between parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers have also recently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; that found an association between both gum diseases and tooth cavities, and having a higher risk of stroke. These links underline just how important oral health is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034512457373"&gt;almost half&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the US have some form of gum disease, tackling that problem could have knock-on benefits for health more generally. However, the researchers also raise the possibility that shared risk factors for blood vessel health are potentially affecting both gums and brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed to understand this relationship, these findings add to growing evidence that keeping your mouth healthy may support a healthier brain," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000037"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere","elementId":"cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/measles-outbreak-ontario-canada"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada – or other countries in North America even – should lose their measles elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks.

A new study suggests that advice may need a rethink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 200 people in the US, Canada, and Australia who were about to undergo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electrical-cardioversion"&gt;electrical cardioversion&lt;/a&gt; for atrial fibrillation (AF). All were current or former coffee drinkers. Half agreed to avoid coffee for six months; the other half agreed to drink at least one cup per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the six months, the researchers tracked AF recurrences lasting more than 30 seconds. In the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;coffee-drinker&lt;/a&gt; group, 47 percent had an episode of AF, compared with 64 percent of abstainers. That equates to a 39 percent lower risk for coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-pouches-can-pack-2-coffees-in-1-hit-heres-why-theyre-a-risk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Pouches Can Pack 2 Coffees in 1 Hit.

We know that coffee can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-coffee-boost-your-exercise-performance-here-s-what-three-experts-have-to-say"&gt;boost exercise performance&lt;/a&gt;, which could protect against AF episodes (the study didn't collect detailed diet/exercise data).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg" alt="Atrial fibrillation chart" class="wp-image-180856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of atrial fibrillation were less common in coffee drinkers.

These characteristics can also help reduce high blood pressure, a risk factor for AF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may simply be the case that drinking coffee means people aren't sipping on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-diet-soda-a-day-may-raise-your-type-2-diabetes-risk-by-38"&gt;unhealthy beverages&lt;/a&gt; instead, according to the researchers, although these possibilities weren't directly explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AF affects &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316340"&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; of people worldwide.

The UK &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, houses retinal and health data from more than 500,000 volunteers, giving scientists an unprecedented window into how subtle eye features mirror the body’s overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-oculomics-the-basics"&gt;Understanding oculomics – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting-edge technology used in the nascent field of oculomics allows scientists and doctors to uncover signs of heart disease, diabetes, kidney issues, and even neurological disorders – all from a quick, noninvasive eye scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-the-eyes-retina-can-reconnect-itself-to-maintain-vision/"&gt;human retina&lt;/a&gt; is an extension of the brain and shares blood vessels with other vital organs. This means tiny changes in the retina’s structure or color can signal bigger problems elsewhere in the body, long before symptoms appear elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced AI algorithms analyze high-resolution images of the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels to detect patterns far too subtle for the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-eyes-retina-sync-everything-they-see-before-sending-visual-signals-to-the-brain/"&gt;human eye&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These AI systems can measure vessel width, nerve fiber thickness, pigmentation, and even microstructural changes in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining ocular data with genetic, lifestyle, and clinical information, AI used in oculomics can create what researchers call a “digital eyeprint” – a personal health signature that reflects how well your body is functioning as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-retinal-link-to-systemic-disease"&gt;Retinal link to systemic disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Dr. Tien Yin Wong at the &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Singapore National Eye Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke NUS Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (SNEC). His research centers on retinal imaging, artificial intelligence, and how ocular clues relate to systemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retina, a thin light-sensing layer at the back of the eye, exposes tiny blood vessels and nerve tissue with uncommon clarity. Those are two organ systems that usually cannot be examined directly without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oculomics connects small changes in retinal structure and blood flow to patterns seen in the heart, brain, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-and-ai"&gt;Oculomics and AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep-learning study trained on 284,335 patients showed that retinal photographs can estimate common risk factors such as age and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also predicted the likelihood of a major cardiac event within five years – with performance comparable to standard calculators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientific-discoveries-machine-learning/"&gt;Deep learning&lt;/a&gt;, a machine-learning method that identifies patterns from large datasets, excels at finding subtle image features that humans miss. It weighs vessel width, twists, and textures, then converts them into a composite risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-clues-in-every-eye-photo"&gt;Health clues in every eye photo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-country system used retinal photos to estimate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;coronary artery calcium&lt;/a&gt; – calcium buildup in heart arteries that indicates plaque burden – and stratified cardiovascular risk without a CT scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach offered a low-cost, noninvasive way to identify who might need more intensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate algorithm detected &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-identifies-early-stage-alzheimers-with-90-percent-accuracy/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; from retinal photographs in a multicenter sample. The model captured disease-linked features in the macula and microvasculature while standardizing results across sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team reported a retinal age-gap biomarker that correlated with mortality risk. When the predicted retinal age exceeded a person’s actual age, risk increased modestly but consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-joins-primary-care"&gt;AI joins primary care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision permits the marketing of a novel artificial intelligence technology that can be used in a primary care doctor’s office,” said Dr. Malvina Eydelman, an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; device director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have started to permit autonomous tools that interpret retinal images in primary care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That early green light focused on diabetic retinopathy, but it set a clear precedent. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-imaging-traces-humans-view/"&gt;Autonomous AI&lt;/a&gt;, software that can make a clinical call without human oversight, could triage patients where specialists are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-still-has-limitations"&gt;Oculomics still has limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clearest successes so far lie in high-burden conditions with well-defined biological signatures in the eye. Heart risk, cognitive decline, diabetes, and kidney stress all leave detectable traces in vessel shape or retinal layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limits still matter. Generalizability – the ability of a model to perform reliably across new clinics and populations – can falter when cameras, image quality, or patient backgrounds differ from the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians should treat oculomics outputs like any other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt;, a measurable signal that reflects disease risk. A positive result may prompt follow-up tests, not an instant diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False alarms and misses will happen, especially at the edges. That is why teams are validating models prospectively, recalibrating thresholds, and combining image signals with routine vitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-as-health-sensors"&gt;Eyes as health sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-tissue-spinach-leaves/"&gt;microvasculature&lt;/a&gt; – the body’s smallest blood vessels that carry oxygen – is visible in every retinal image, offering a clear snapshot of vascular health throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern cameras now make that window easy to access: a 30-second, noninvasive photo can be taken in a primary care clinic, a pharmacy, or even by mobile teams during community screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portable imaging systems and home-based vision tools are extending that reach even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As datasets expand, foundation models – large pre-trained AI systems that can adapt to many tasks – are expected to improve stability and reduce the need for manual labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is precision prevention. By translating subtle eye signals into actionable health insights, oculomics could help match each patient to the right “next step,” whether that means starting a statin, investigating cognitive decline, or tightening glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946225000230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress in Retinal and Eye Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:15:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOSTByRFlkTzVHMzNXTVFRRzFsTTNVeWp3QVQ0SjJPMzIxWjltazZ2SHhFUUYxTzNsRHhKdVhCODgweUh1RVZ1MWdHdzlqb2FuVVlLS2tHUUlDQmY3cDRzVzdQTXY1WmpiYl9tMzdkWFFCMzRCWHpOUTl4bG03MFZwRF91ZGxlMzJvVjZqcUt0UGNvZWNQZnZIeElIcEphMGRBcTZiWkFvbDRSTjFMdXNPYmFJdlY5MnM</guid></item><item><title>加拿大战胜了麻疹和麻疹；病毒在1998年消除后流行- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said in a press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbosa was optimistic that Canada could regain its elimination status. He highlighted that such setbacks have happened before. “In 2018 and 2019, Venezuela and Brazil temporarily lost their elimination status following large outbreaks,” Barbosa noted. “Thanks to coordinated action by governments, civil society, and regional cooperation, those outbreaks were contained, and the Region of the Americas regained its measles-free status in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;the Public Health Agency of Canada released a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming that it received notification from PAHO that it had lost its measles elimination status, while reporting that it is already getting to work on earning it back. “PHAC is collaborating with the PAHO and working with federal, provincial, territorial, and community partners to implement coordinated actions—focused on improving vaccination coverage, strengthening data sharing, enabling better overall surveillance efforts, and providing evidence-based guidance,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Canada isn’t the only country facing an uphill battle against measles—the most infectious virus known to humankind. Outbreaks and sustained spread are also active in the US and Mexico. To date, the US has documented at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, while Mexico has tallied at least &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/1036453/INFORME_DIARIO_SARAMPION_20251107.pdf"&gt;5,185&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have ongoing outbreaks, PAHO reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of November 7, PAHO has collected reports of 12,593 confirmed measles cases from 10 countries, but approximately 95 percent of them are in Canada, Mexico, and the US. That total is a 30-fold increase compared to 2024, PAHO notes, and the rise has led to at least 28 deaths: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PAHO used Canada’s loss as a call to action not just in the northern country, but the rest of the region. “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier,” Barbosa said. “Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than two decades, the Food and Drug Administration has warned women about the potential risks of using estrogen to treat menopause symptoms. And that's because early studies showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders and breast cancer. Well, those warnings are going away, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary led the way on that decision, and he's here with me in studio now. Thanks for coming by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTY MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: So, I mean, this black box warning that we're talking about, it's been in place on all estrogen treatments for more than two decades, since back in 2003. The timing - why remove it now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, the fear machine did start in 2003, after a 2002 study that really hit the airwaves in the media with a big splash, scaring women out of hormone replacement therapy in the postmenopausal setting. Up to 1 in 4 Americans were taking it. Women lived longer and felt better. But then it got deemed a carcinogen based on this study. It turns out when the study results were finally released after the media announcement, there was no statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer. There was a lower rate of breast cancer in the estrogen-only group. And so it ends up being very nuanced. And the cardiovascular benefits are profound when hormone replacement therapy is started within 10 years of the onset of menopause. So there is some nuance here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: But unfortunately, the fear machine has dominated the field, and women have been talked out of it. They've been denied or never offered hormone replacement therapy despite the profound short-term and long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Well, let's talk about that for a second, because there is a lot of nuance here. Just spell out plainly for us some of the benefits of hormone therapy as you see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. So starting hormone replacement therapy around the time of menopause not only can alleviate the short-term symptoms of menopause - that is the hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, weight gain, difficulty sleeping...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...Pain with sexual activity. There are 50-plus different symptoms, and every woman experiences them differently. You know, we were taught at medical school that some women have symptoms, but they're usually mild and last just a couple years - not true. Eighty-plus percent of women have symptoms. The average duration is eight years, and for many women, it is severe. They are debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term benefits are remarkable and massively misunderstood. It reduces the risk of bone fractures later in life by 50- to 60%. That's a New England Journal study. It reduces cognitive decline by up to 64%. In one study, reduced the risk of Alzheimer's by 35%, and there are cardiovascular benefits when it's started within 10 years of the onset of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Does it matter if a woman is taking a pill, which is systemic, or using a cream, which is a local treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there are pills. There are patches. There are creams and gels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: And so all of these products had a black box warning from the FDA as a part of this pile-on, as a part of this bandwagon thinking in 2002, 2003. We are removing those and putting the nuances of the risks in the package insert. And the idea is to get better information in front of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Spell out some of these risks for us, because there are still risks associated with hormone replacement therapy, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. When started more than 10 years after the onset of menopause, then you actually see some of these risks that are - have been attributed to all hormone replacement therapy products. And that's probably because the body naturally is making estrogen, and that increases nitric oxide. It keeps the blood vessels soft and the walls soft and healthy and dilated. And so when it started such that there's not a gap where your body is without it, then there are cardiovascular benefits where the reduction in heart disease has been noted to be 35 - 30- to 50%. That is a 30- to 50% reduction in heart disease, and in a study in circulation two years ago, a 48% decline in heart attack deaths. And so that is because of the effect of estrogen. So if it's started too late, the blood vessels are narrowing and the theory is that they're hardening and that aging and atherosclerosis can then result in a situation that is prone for a blood clot...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...With hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Commissioner, are there women who should not be using hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yes. Many doctors do identify some contraindications - a woman with an underlying risk for blood clots, a woman with active breast cancer or past breast cancer, depending on the practice style of the physician. But the vast majority of women who go through menopause, which is about 2 million women a year, are great candidates for hormone replacement therapy. If a woman has a uterus, it's important for them to also take progesterone to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and possibly uterine cancer. But women who have been taking this for a long time have reported tremendous benefits, and they're talking about it on social media now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there is a bit of an awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I do want to ask you about the process here. Because in preparing to remove the black box warning, there's usually a formal, very detailed process. Things seemed to play out differently this time. Tell us why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. We're getting things done. In this administration, at the FDA, we're getting things done. They were talking about removing or banning a food dye for 35 years before I got to the FDA. Within weeks, we took action to remove nine petroleum-based food dyes from the food supply. That's all artificial dyes. In this case, we are responding to a petition that was filed in 2016. It was basically blown off. It was refiled in 2025. We held an expert panel. We didn't go through the long, bureaucratic, expensive process of bringing in conflicted experts to talk about a product. We brought in a range of diverse medical experts who passionately made the case for stopping this fear machine by removing the black box warnings around cardiovascular disease, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I mean, over the last several years in our society, I don't have to tell you this, but there has been this increasing recognition of the health challenges, the very real challenges that women face during menopause, and you and I were talking about the nuance in this conversation earlier. Do you worry at all that by removing this black box warning, that it might result in the pendulum tipping the other way, and there's now going to be an overuse of hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, tragically, over the last 23 years, 50 million women have been denied or talked out of hormone replacement therapy in part because of the fear machine that it - hormone replacement therapy is a carcinogen, it causes breast cancer. We can argue whether or not the old type of progesterone used, called MPA, in that original study may have slightly increased the risk of breast cancer in women who took that MPA. But no clinical trial has ever found that it increases the risk of breast cancer mortality. And if it did, that harm would be far eclipsed by the profound cardiovascular benefits. You know, early on in the 1920s, Mayo Clinic researchers noted that young girls who had their ovaries removed went on to have heart disease in their 30s and 40s, suggesting a profound cardiovascular protective effect. And so that's the nuance conversation that people need to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: We've been speaking with FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, coming in to talk to us about the FDA's decision to remove black box warnings for estrogen treatments for menopause. Thank you so much for coming by our studios today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There's a difference in how the &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69110713/brain-creates-reality-illusion/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69110713/brain-creates-reality-illusion/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; operates on a short-term versus long-term fast. Read on to find out more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="short-term-vs-long-term-fasting-whats-better-for-cognition" data-node-id="4" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Short-Term vs Long-Term Fasting: What's Better for Cognition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Researchers analyzed 71 studies that recruited nearly 3,500 people who were either fasting or had recently eaten. They compared their cognitive performance, including memory recall, decision-making, response time, and accuracy. Most of the fasting periods were short-term, lasting on average around 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered no meaningful difference in cognition in people who did short-term fasts and those who recently ate. “The brain has built-in mechanisms to stay fueled and functional, even in the absence of food—a reassuring message for anyone who practices intermittent fasting,” Moreau says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now this wasn't the case for people who did longer fasts that lasted over 12 hours. For this group, the researchers found small dips in their cognitive performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fasts that last longer than 24 hours may negatively affect cognitive performance,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, consulting nutritionist and former spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. But, like the study showed, Angelone says short-term intermittent fasting can be safe mentally for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-what-if-you-do-feel-unfocused-when-fasting" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;But What if You &lt;em data-node-id="9.0.1"&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="9.0.2"&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; Feel Unfocused When Fasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now the study showed no actual difference in cognitive performance in people &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to short-term fasting. But if you're just starting out, your body needs time to adapt. &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab, says it could be one reason why you might feel mentally off when you first start fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It’s harder for people who never fast,” he explains. “If you don’t eat and you usually eat on a consistent schedule, you might be very hungry—that’s mentally distracting.” People with metabolic conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; may find that intermittent fasting impacts their cognition, too, Moreau says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-how-does-fasting-affect-the-brain" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;So How Does Fasting Affect the Brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Fasting does impact your brain—just not in your cognitive abilities (which is how you think, learn, remember, and judge things). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Under normal eating conditions, Moreau says it mainly relies on glucose stored as glycogen. Cue fasting. When you skip a meal, you lose that source of fuel. However, Moreau says the brain is "remarkably adaptable" and has a backup plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“When glycogen levels fall during fasting, the body begins converting fat into ketone bodies, which the brain can use as an efficient alternative fuel," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Your brain metabolism is prioritized over other parts of your body so, if you fast, your brain gets fed before your muscles," adds &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. And that's what allows your cognition to stay steady over short-term fasting, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This flexibility helps ensure that your brain gets a steady energy supply, even when food is scarce, Moreau says. “In evolutionary terms, it makes sense: Our ancestors needed to stay alert and think clearly while seeking food, not become sluggish when hungry,” he says. “That capacity for cognitive stability likely persists today.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-cmvt2k ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a recent study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one that prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but it also shows that other factors are at work. In rare cases like this, normally benign &lt;span&gt;viruses&lt;/span&gt; can have devastating effects in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That emphasizes the need for targeted, personalized &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; that may well be more effective than conventional and generic approaches. It's likely that the woman involved in this study is far from the only one with this set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason to be hopeful could come from progress against a related disease. Alpha-HPV is known as the cause of many cervical and throat cancers, and widespread vaccination against the virus has resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;drastic drop&lt;/a&gt; in deaths from those cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single, universal cure for cancer remains elusive, we are continuing to see steadily improving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;survival and recovery rates&lt;/a&gt; across many cancer types, including cSCC – something this new research should also help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects nearly 40 million individuals globally, resulting in a gradual loss of memory and independence. Despite extensive research over the past decades, no treatments have been found that can halt or reverse the progression of this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In AD, a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction is the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein+tau/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein tau&lt;/a&gt;. Tau typically plays a crucial role in keeping the internal structure of neurons stable, much like train tracks help trains stay on course. However, in some diseases, tau undergoes abnormal modifications and starts to aggregate, disrupting this transport system, thus leading to neuronal damage and subsequent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has reported a new mechanism by which boosting the natural metabolite NAD⁺ can protect the brain from the degeneration associated with AD. Their paper, titled "NAD⁺ reverses Alzheimer's neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C," is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady9811" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is led by Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital, Norway, in collaboration with Professor Oscar Junhong Luo from Jinan University, China, and Associate Professor Joana M. Silva from the University of Minho, Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How NAD⁺ supports brain health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD⁺ (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+adenine+dinucleotide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt;, oxidized form) is a vital metabolite involved in energy metabolism and neuronal resilience in the body. It normally declines with age and especially in various neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary studies have shown that supplementation with NAD⁺ precursors, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+riboside/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide riboside&lt;/a&gt; (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), can offer therapeutic benefits in AD animal models and early clinical trials. However, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; behind these benefits remain largely unclear," first author Alice Ruixue Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study reveals that NAD⁺ works through a previously unidentified RNA-splicing pathway. This pathway is regulated by a protein called EVA1C, which plays an essential role in the process of RNA splicing. RNA splicing allows a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single gene&lt;/a&gt; to produce multiple isoforms of a protein, and one isoform may show distinctive effects from the other isoforms. Its dysregulation is one of the most recently acknowledged risk factors for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that when NAD⁺ levels are increased, EVA1C helps correct mistakes in RNA splicing. This restoration process improves the function of hundreds of genes, many crucial for brain health, which can help reverse the neurodegenerative damage caused by tau.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Cross-species validation from worms to mice to the human brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the impact of this mechanism, the researchers used a comprehensive approach that included computer predictions and validation in different animal models, including worms, mice, as well as human brain samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first identified age-related changes in RNA splicing in a specific type of worm. They found that adding NAD⁺ could correct the splicing issues caused by the toxic tau protein. In mice with tau-related mutations, NAD⁺ supplements improved RNA splicing, restored brain function, and enhanced memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Notably, we found when the EVA1C gene was knocked down, these benefits were lost, confirming that EVA1C is essential for NAD⁺-mediated neuroprotection," Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligned with these animal studies, EVA1C levels were significantly reduced in brain cells from people with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using AI to uncover the mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further investigate how EVA1C works, the team used an AI-driven platform to predict how proteins interact with one another, analyzing structural, sequential, and evolutionary data from millions of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis revealed that NAD⁺ promotes a specific form of EVA1C that efficiently binds to essential proteins, which are central to protein folding and clearance. This connection links metabolic homeostasis, RNA splicing processes and protein management, three processes that are critically impaired in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Towards new Alzheimer's treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By establishing the connection between NAD⁺ and EVA1C, this study lays the groundwork for the development of new therapies and optimization of NAD⁺ augmentation strategies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We propose that maintaining NAD⁺ levels could help preserve neuronal identity and delay &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for combination treatments to enhance RNA splicing," Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with anxiety disorders have lower levels of choline in their brains, according to research from UC Davis Health.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers compared the levels of neurometabolites—chemicals produced during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain metabolism&lt;/a&gt;—in 370 people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anxiety+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt; to 342 people without anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the level of choline—an essential nutrient—was about 8% lower in those with anxiety disorders. The evidence for low choline was especially consistent in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps control thinking, emotions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first meta-analysis to show a chemical pattern in the brain in anxiety disorders," said Jason Smucny, co-author and an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. "It suggests nutritional approaches—like appropriate choline supplementation—may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choline (pronounced KOE lean) is vital for cell membranes and brain functions like memory, mood regulation and muscle control. The body makes a small amount, but most must come from food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety disorders affect about 30% of adults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Maddock, senior author of the study, is a psychiatrist and research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. He is also a researcher at the UC Davis Imaging Research Center, which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to study brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock spent decades in clinical practice treating patients with anxiety disorders and conducting research on these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults. They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment," Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panic disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social anxiety disorders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phobias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Brain interactions affect anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are linked to how different parts of the brain—like the amygdala, which influences our sense of safety or danger, and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in planning and decision-making—respond to stress or potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are also linked to imbalances in neurotransmitters. For example, norepinephrine—part of the body's "fight-or-flight" response—is often elevated in anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the brain can tell the difference between potential threats that are manageable and those that are not. In anxiety disorders, manageable threats can seem overwhelming. For example, with generalized anxiety disorder, people worry excessively about everyday things and have trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noninvasive technique identifies chemical levels in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock and Smucny have spent years studying brain chemistry and its association with mental illness using a noninvasive medical imaging technique known as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or 1H-MRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measurements are made using an MRI machine. 1H-MRS uses the magnetic fields and radio waves of an MRI to analyze the body. However, instead of creating an image of the body, it provides data about the chemicals that are present in the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock had noticed low levels of choline in his &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/4002137" target="_blank"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; of patients with panic disorder. He decided to conduct a meta-analysis with Smucny. And even though they thought they would find low choline, he was still surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An 8% lower amount doesn't sound like that much, but in the brain it's significant," Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;



                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Most Americans don't get enough choline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think the high fight-or-flight activity experienced in anxiety disorders may increase choline demand, lowering its levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't know yet if increasing choline in the diet will help reduce anxiety. More research will be needed," Maddock said. He cautions that people with anxiety should not self-medicate with excessive choline supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he notes a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; is essential for all aspects of health, including mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Someone with an anxiety disorder might want to look at their diet and see whether they are getting the recommended daily amount of choline. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2015.1080127" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that most people in the U.S., including children, don't get the recommended daily amount," Maddock said. "Some forms of omega-3 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+acids/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, like those found in salmon, may be especially good sources for supplying choline to the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other foods rich in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/choline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; include beef liver, eggs (particularly the yolk), beef, chicken, fish, soybeans and milk, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

But with so many products to choose from in the cold and flu aisle, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTC &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/whats-the-best-cough-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold and flu medicines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold and flu medicines&lt;/a&gt; won’t cure an infection. But they can help make symptoms more manageable. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodRx;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;, a platform for medication savings, explains how to determine which OTC medicines are the best for colds and flus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many OTC cold and flu medicines available. Many ingredients can be found on their own and used in combination products for multisymptom relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen (Tylenol), dextromethorphan (Delsym), and phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) are commonly found in combination cold and flu products. These ingredients target symptoms such as fever, cough, and congestion. However, phenylephrine may not actually be effective for a stuffy nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking product ingredients before making the purchase can help avoid doubling up on medications and treating nonexistent symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best OTC cold and flu medicine can depend on symptoms, age, and health conditions. A pharmacist can help with navigating options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the best OTC cold and flu medicines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best OTC cold and flu medicine is one that targets specific symptoms. And it shouldn’t interfere with other medications or health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing aside, there are just a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/ingredients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:active ingredients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;active ingredients&lt;/a&gt; found in cold and flu medicines. But which ones are best for which symptoms? Common symptoms are broken down in the table and subsequent sections below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A table listing symptoms, its equivalent medicine and its active ingredients and onset, and what's good to know about each. - GoodRx&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fever and aches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two OTC options to help bring down a fever: &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/acetaminophen/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/nsaid-list" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NSAIDs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/a&gt;), such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ibuprofen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; (Motrin, Advil). Both can provide relief for headaches and achy muscles, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/aspirin/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aspirin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aspirin&lt;/a&gt; is also an NSAID option, but it should be &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/aspirin/reyes-syndrome-and-its-link-to-aspirin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoided by people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avoided by people&lt;/a&gt; under age 19. That’s because it’s linked to a dangerous condition called Reye’s syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications are available on their own for fever and minor aches. They can also be found in a variety of combination products for multisymptom relief. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/children-s-tylenol/tylenol-dosage-for-kids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Both acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Both acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/childrens-health/childrens-ibuprofen-dosage-how-much-is-safe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ibuprofen have dosage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ibuprofen have dosage&lt;/a&gt; instructions for children based on their &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/weight-based-medication-dosage" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple dosage forms are available for each medication, including capsules and tablets, liquids, and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/what-is-suppository" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suppositories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suppositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen takes about &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/tylenol/how-long-does-tylenol-take-to-work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:15 to 60 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;15 to 60 minutes&lt;/a&gt; to kick in, depending on the product. Ibuprofen can take about &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/how-long-does-ibuprofen-take-to-work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 minutes to 2 hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20 minutes to 2 hours&lt;/a&gt;, with the liquid-filled gel capsules working the fastest. There is also the option to alternate products. This means if acetaminophen doesn’t provide relief, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/is-it-safe-to-take-tylenol-acetaminophen-with-advil-or-motrin-ibuprofen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a dose of ibuprofen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a dose of ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; can be taken a few hours later.

If taking a few different products for your symptoms, check to make sure not to double up. The same is true with NSAIDs like ibuprofen, which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/nsaids-ibuprofen-bad-liver-kidneys" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney damage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidney damage&lt;/a&gt; and stomach ulcers &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/how-much-is-too-much-advil-ibuprofen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:if a person takes too much;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;if a person takes too much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tylenol and NSAIDs aren’t safe for everyone. Those who take medications or have other health conditions should check with a healthcare professional first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/dextromethorphan/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dextromethorphan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dextromethorphan&lt;/a&gt; (Delsym) and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/guaifenesin/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guaifenesin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guaifenesin&lt;/a&gt; (Mucinex) are common go-to &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/whats-the-best-cough-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:remedies for cough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;remedies for cough&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s thought to work by blocking cough reflexes. This may be helpful for a dry, hacking cough that doesn’t produce mucus. Dextromethorphan usually starts working &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dextromethorphan#section=Absorption-Distribution-and-Excretion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 15 to 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 15 to 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It’s supposed to loosen up and thin the mucus in the airways of those with a wet cough. This can help make coughing up the mucus easier. But &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.relieving-a-cough.ug1887" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drinking water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; can have a similar effect. Guaifenesin can start kicking in &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/expectorant-vs-mucolytic#when-they-start-working" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are available on their own and in combination products. Sometimes they can be found together, as with &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/mucinex-dm/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex DM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex DM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that OTC cough medications can have &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/should-you-give-kids-medicine-coughs-and-colds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; in young children &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/childrens-health/toddler-otc-cold-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:under age 4;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;under age 4&lt;/a&gt;. So, it’s best to check with their pediatrician about your options. Medication-free alternatives, such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/does-honey-help-cough" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:honey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/botulism/what-is-botulism-and-why-is-it-deadly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:12 months old;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;12 months old&lt;/a&gt;) or a cool-mist &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/respiratory/cool-vs-warm-mist-humidifier" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humidifier;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;humidifier&lt;/a&gt;, may be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sinus congestion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for a stuffy nose. First, consider nonprescription oral and nasal decongestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decongestant nasal sprays typically kick in the fastest — within 2 to 10 minutes. But they shouldn’t be used for &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/nasal-congestion/rebound-congestion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than three days;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more than three days&lt;/a&gt; because symptoms could come back worse and be tougher to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudoephedrine &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/alpha-agonists/sudafed-vs-sudafed-pe-whats-the-difference" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:works better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;works better&lt;/a&gt; of the two oral options. It typically starts working &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/how-long-take-oral-decongestants-sudafed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of these medications can have risks in young children, too. Check with a healthcare professional before taking one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which cold and flu medicines are best for nighttime?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/how-to-sleep-with-cold" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:feeling sick and trying to go to sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;feeling sick and trying to go to sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the last thing anyone wants is something that will keep them awake. But certain ingredients in cold and flu medicines may do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, avoid taking daytime cold and flu medications at night. They may include ingredients that are stimulating and can &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/insomnia/could-your-medication-be-causing-insomnia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interfere with sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nighttime” products, on the other hand, may contain ingredients that &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/side-effects/prescription-make-you-tired" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make you sleepy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make you sleepy&lt;/a&gt;. For those who are having difficulty sleeping, this can be a welcome side effect. Examples include antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and doxylamine. Dextromethorphan can also &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/dextromethorphan/dextromethorphan-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cause drowsiness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cause drowsiness&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that some products contain alcohol, which may not be ideal for certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists can be a good resource for those who are unsure of when to take a specific product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips for picking the best cold and flu medication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, this story has covered some of the basics to help navigate the best OTC cold and flu medicine options. But there are a few more things to know before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Many OTC cold and flu medications have the same or similar ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, there are just a handful of ingredients found in OTC cold and flu medications. This may be surprising given how many different products are found on pharmacy shelves. What’s more, many products are the same or very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=a3523aa3-9ed1-472d-9986-438440d0a3eb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex Fast-Max Cold, Flu, &amp;amp; Sore Throat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex Fast-Max Cold, Flu, &amp;amp; Sore Throat&lt;/a&gt; contains the exact same active ingredients as &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=fe7eeb71-e219-4c84-ac06-98c3a40b14dc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex Fast-Max Cold &amp;amp; Flu (All-in-One);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex Fast-Max Cold &amp;amp; Flu (All-in-One)&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is judging the product on the label alone, they might pick one over the other based on how it’s named. Taking different products with the same ingredient could result in the person taking too much of that particular medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a product, try to pay less attention to the marketing. Look at the &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/otc/medicine-label" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:OTC medication label;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;OTC medication label&lt;/a&gt; instead. It’ll list the active ingredients, amounts, and symptoms the product is intended to treat. This can help avoid duplicating ingredients. And the shopper may even find a better deal for the same combination of medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Generics and store brands can help save money&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/brand-vs-generic-drugs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Generic medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Generic medication&lt;/a&gt; names like dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine aren’t always commonly known. People may be more familiar with their branded products — Delsym and Benadryl. But when people buy the brand, they’re really just paying for the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generics work just as well as their brand-name counterparts. Store-brand (also called private-label) versions are also a great option. And they can save some money, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with the generic names, ask a pharmacist. They can help select the right product to meet needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. People may be taking more medication than necessary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to avoid throwing the kitchen sink at &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/cold-vs-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold or flu symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold or flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Especially with OTC combination products, people may end up taking more medication than they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people may keep a combination product like &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/nyquil/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NyQuil Cold and Flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NyQuil Cold and Flu&lt;/a&gt; on hand for when they get sick. It contains acetaminophen, as well as medications for cough and a runny nose. But if someone doesn’t have a fever or aches, they’ll end up taking acetaminophen — even though they don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combination products can be convenient. But taking unnecessary medications can increase the risk of side effects, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/safety/drug-interactions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interactions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Be sure to check product ingredients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Know when to consult with a doctor about cold and flu medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to know when to skip OTC cold and flu medicines altogether. In some cases, people are better off speaking to their primary care provider or another healthcare professional. A prescription may be needed for cold and flu medications. Or more targeted treatments, such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/antiviral-medications-for-the-flu-options" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu antivirals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu antivirals&lt;/a&gt;, that aren’t available OTC, may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should talk to a healthcare professional about their symptoms if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/takingcare/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:age 65 or older;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;age 65 or older&lt;/a&gt; and think they have the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who’s sick is an &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/flu-in-infants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/signs-of-flu-in-toddlers#getting-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:child;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt; under age 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/autoimmune/do-i-have-a-weak-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weakened immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weakened immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They take &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/side-effects/medications-that-weaken-your-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; that weaken the immune system, such as prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve been taking OTC cold and flu medicines for one week and don’t feel any better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their symptoms initially improve and then worsen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/self-care#when-to-get-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more severe cold or flu symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more severe cold or flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cold and flu medicines should people avoid taking together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold and flu medicines that contain the same ingredients or ingredients that belong to the same drug class together shouldn’t be combined. For example, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine shouldn’t be taken together since they’re &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/antihistamines/interactions#other-antihistamines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:both antihistamines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;both antihistamines&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the case for taking multiple NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cold medications work the fastest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which cold medications work the fastest depends on which symptoms are being treated. For congestion, decongestant nasal sprays &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/alpha-1-agonists/afrin-vs-sudafed#active-ingredients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:work the fastest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;work the fastest&lt;/a&gt;. For a fever, there &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/treating-sore-throat-pain-advil-tylenol-aspirin#comparing-pain-meds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t a significant difference;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t a significant difference&lt;/a&gt; between acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. And for a runny nose, nasal spray antihistamines, such as azelastine, usually &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/allergies/taking-allergy-meds-everyday#fast-acting-meds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:start working faster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;start working faster&lt;/a&gt; than oral antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dealing with cold and flu symptoms, over-the-counter (OTC) remedies may help provide some relief. Fever reducers, cough suppressants, and decongestants are common options to consider. They can be found on their own and in combination products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check a product’s ingredients before purchasing, since it’s best to avoid taking unnecessary medications. Also consider generics and store brands over brand-name products to help save money. Pharmacists can help navigate these options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/how-to-choose-the-best-cold-and-flu-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodRx;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoodRx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 20:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB3RS1MZWJtZU1EekdKWXc3Sm83Zm5vLWZpakJKWjNXeFk4WlBfR0J3SXlwRGVORmV3by1CdTBRVW96em1TVnhvQko5RDdmaFVyZV9yVWxXX29Ec2phWENMcjVJazN4emdLSi1jaUJVYUdLVGhWeHQtSS1XbjRXZw</guid></item><item><title>拯救噬菌体？ PITT LAB开发病毒来对抗抗生素耐药性细菌- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/phages-to-the-rescue-pitt-lab-develops-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antibody-like compound known on land to be exclusively to be found in camelids like alpacas, lamas, and dromedaries, could be used to treat human brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s focus were antibody-like proteins, aptly called nanobodies, whose small size allowed the scientists to treat neurological conditions in mice more effectively and with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147%2825%2900228-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, outlines the next steps towards developing nanobody treatments that are safe for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Camelid nanobodies open a new era of biologic therapies for brain disorders and revolutionize our thinking about therapeutics,” said Dr. Philippe Rondard, of &lt;em&gt;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique&lt;/em&gt; (CNRS) in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe they can form a new class of drugs between conventional antibodies and small molecules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanobodies were first discovered in the early 1990s by Belgian scientists studying the immune systems of camelids. They found that as well as making conventional antibodies, which are composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, camelids also produce antibodies with just heavy chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antigen-binding fragments of those antibodies are now known as nanobodies. They’re just one-tenth the size of conventional antibodies, and have not been found in any other mammals, say scientists, although they have been observed recently in some cartilaginous fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic approaches for diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders often centre around antibodies. The treatments that have shown some therapeutic benefits, including a few drugs for Alzheimer’s treatment, are often associated with secondary side effects, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their much smaller size, scientists say nanobodies have the potential to offer better efficacy for brain diseases with fewer side effects. In previous studies, the team has shown that nanobodies can restore behavioral deficits in mouse models of schizophrenia and other neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are highly soluble small proteins that can enter the brain passively,” said co-author Dr. Pierre-André Lafon, also of CNRS. “By contrast, small-molecule drugs that are designed to cross the blood-brain barrier are hydrophobic in nature, which limits their bioavailability, increases the risk of off-target binding, and is linked to side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says nanobodies are also easier than conventional antibodies to produce, purify, and engineer and can be fine-tuned to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers acknowledge that several steps need to be taken before nanobodies can be tested in human clinical trials for brain disorders. They say toxicology and long-term safety testing are essential, and the effect of chronic administration needs to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It will be necessary to obtain clinical-grade nanobodies and stable formulations that maintain activity during long-term storage and transport,” said Dr. Rondard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lafon added that his lab has already started to study these different parameters for a few brain-penetrant nanobodies and has recently shown that conditions of treatment are compatible with chronic treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

You can hear your blood pulsing in your veins. Every time he even looks at you, you feel a burst of energy. &lt;em&gt;Could it be? Am I in love? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies send signals that say, "This one could be a keeper," and it's no big surprise. But how does falling in love work exactly? Is it something we do subconsciously? Do our brains and bodies really tell us when we're in love? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 5 scientific ways to tell you’re falling in love for real:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. You catch yourself staring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/312/lucy-l-brown" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Lucy L. Brown,&lt;/a&gt; a neuroscientist and professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who has studied the neural basis of emotion, says the eyes matter most. When you're in love, you involuntarily cannot keep your eyes off the object of your affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans naturally find &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/secrets-learn-about-someone-looking-them-in-eye"&gt;eye contact rewarding&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that, but we're physically compelled to pursue eye contact with our romantic interests. "One of the involuntary manifestations of being in love is 'mooning around' the person, having your eyes constantly fixed on a person," Dr. Brown says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/secrets-learn-about-someone-looking-them-in-eye"&gt;Psychology Reveals The 5 Secrets You Can Learn About Someone Just By Looking Them In The Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. You feel high&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-11/art-of-human-chemistry-scientific-ways-to-tell-you%E2%80%99re-falling-in-love-for-real-high.png" alt="Person feels the height of love" title="art of human chemistry scientific ways to tell you’re falling in love for real high" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;pics five via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you realize you've been hyperactively talking about your new beau, you might think you've had too much caffeine. It's actually a different drug. "Being in love is like being &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/morethan"&gt;high on cocaine&lt;/a&gt;," says Dr. Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the physical symptoms are the same: increased energy, increased heart rate and blood pressure (especially when you see the person), and the inability to sleep or eat. Feelings of euphoria also appear with cocaine use, as they do when in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms occur because, while the brain produces dopamine on its own, it produces even more when in love. The brain also produces &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc4911849" rel="nofollow"&gt;more of the chemical norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; when we're in love, speeding up the heart when we're nervous, as we might be upon seeing our beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-03875-003" rel="nofollow"&gt;Some psychologist&lt;/a&gt;s actually regard love as an addiction instead of an emotion because it causes these aforementioned behaviors and because it is a "goal-oriented motivational state" like addiction. Love also activates the subcortical and cortical areas of the brain associated with drug cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/falling-love-like-being-on-this-drug-according-research"&gt;Falling In Love Is Like Being On This Drug, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. You can't keep your hands off each other&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won't just be seeking your beau visually. Just as you hunt down food when hungry, you'll actively engage in proximity-seeking behavior &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/someone-genuinely-in-love-with-you-display-these-tender-behaviors-regular-basis"&gt;when you're in love&lt;/a&gt;. This explains why grade-school flirtation often involves pushing or hair-pulling. When in love, we can't resist the urge to touch our beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biancaacevedo.com/uploads/3/4/6/0/34607369/bianca_p_acevedo_cv_feb_8_2021.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Bianca Acevedo&lt;/a&gt;, visiting scientist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, says that when we're in love, our bodies will subconsciously lean toward each other — a physical manifestation of the brain's desire for emotional closeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/love-lust-questions-must-ask-know-for-sure"&gt;Is It Love Or Lust? 2 Questions You Must Ask To Know For Sure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. You can't stop thinking about them&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the increased dopamine levels of romantic love, people think about their romantic interests, on average, 85 percent of the day. This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-naturally-intelligent-people-do-stop-invasive-thoughts-snowballing"&gt;"intrusive thinking."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Brown, "In the early stages of romantic love, most people can't stop thinking about their beloved. The other person becomes an obsession." And this person will occupy their thoughts for what may seem like an extreme amount of time. But it's really quite normal. In fact, "If it is less than 40 percent, then it is not really intense romantic love," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of obsession, while normal if in love, is often compared to that of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/devastating-hell-living-obsessive-compulsive-disorder"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;/a&gt; When patients undergo treatment for OCD, they're provided with serotonin reuptake inhibitors to ease their obsessions. Because of this, scientists figure that the decrease in the brain's normal serotonin levels causes similar behaviors when in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/behaviors-couples-become-more-obsessed-each-other-as-they-age"&gt;4 Behaviors Of Couples Who Become More Obsessed With Each Other As They Age, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. You have strong feelings for only them&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-11/art-of-human-chemistry-scientific-ways-to-tell-you%E2%80%99re-falling-in-love-for-real-feeling.png" alt="Person feeling light of love in their hands" title="art of human chemistry scientific ways to tell you’re falling in love for real feeling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;sakkmesterke via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Dr. Brown, when we seek a mate with romantic love in mind, we'd prefer a long-lasting relationship. This means we have strong feelings of romantic love for just one person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, feelings of lust are less about a specific person than they are for physical intimacy itself. When it comes to lust, the preferred relationship could be significantly shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/12383030" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to a 2002 study&lt;/a&gt;, if a person is really "in love" with their partner, the desire for emotional union will take precedence over the desire for tactile pleasure. The study also concluded that we seek physical intimacy and exclusivity with this one person because we innately hope for uninterrupted courtship and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Love is a survival system, like being hungry or being thirsty," Dr. Brown says. Our bodies seek love (to reproduce) just as they seek out food or water. Therefore, love for one person is more like a reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people won't die without love, as they would without food or water. Dr. Brown says studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-46916-001" rel="nofollow"&gt;people in relationships live longer&lt;/a&gt;; they're also usually healthier and have a greater sense of well-being. The love of friends and family is also important and can even occasionally substitute for romantic love. However, the kind of love we seek depends very much on our hormonal status, what our bodies need at a certain moment in time. But remember, it doesn't last forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the heightened emotions and general euphoria brought on by romantic love eventually fade. "You can't keep it up forever or you'll never get anything done!" laughs Dr. Brown. "It's too intense to last. Even the most intense romantic love doesn't last more than six months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't worry. As feelings of intense romantic love wane, feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/signs-healthiest-attachment-style-out-there"&gt;attachment develop&lt;/a&gt;, and that's what keeps people together for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can have just 'attachment', but it's better for the couple if there's romantic love at the start. People stay together because they remember the warm, positive feelings of having that original, romantic love." This way, couples will stay together for each other. That attachment is then transferred to their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So love itself doesn't necessarily diminish; it just evolves. But despite all the signs and science, if you're in love, you're in love. Even Dr. Brown agrees: "You know when it happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/art-partnership-ways-be-same-team-totally-different-people"&gt;The Art Of Partnership: 6 Ways To Be On The Same Team When You’re Totally Different People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.miss-manhattan.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elyssa Goodman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer, photographer, and stylist who works primarily within the realms of culture, fashion, relationships, and music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 19:04:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNSUVWdGE5clRlRE5pZFY3Sl9MdEtjUk11WXNJTE1zRndyNHNrd2lHek1KazdLQ2p5eVhNNzVEc3BicXhMYjFmRVp1cXdrVUlKd1JRLUI0V0RCb1QxU3lmbjBWVjdocUs4ODF3Z24tcTdjWTVpR3N4Qk1ScHdFSGt4Z1JB</guid></item><item><title>为什么阿尔茨海默氏症患者会忘记心爱的人-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/alzheimers-neural-net-memory-29913/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have discovered that the heartbreaking moment when a person with Alzheimer’s no longer recognizes family may stem from the breakdown of perineuronal nets, protective structures that support social memory. In mice, the loss of these nets erased memory of familiar individuals while sparing object memory, mirroring early human symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using MMP inhibitors successfully protected these nets and preserved social memory, offering a compelling new strategy for treatment. Because this mechanism appears independent of amyloid buildup, it may reshape how Alzheimer’s disease is understood and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Social memory loss in Alzheimer’s is tied to the degradation of perineuronal nets surrounding neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; MMP inhibitors prevented net breakdown in mice and preserved their ability to recognize familiar individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings reveal a therapeutic pathway independent of amyloid pathology, reshaping prevailing Alzheimer’s models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most devastating moments for family members of a patient with Alzheimer’s is when their loved one forgets who they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New University of Virginia School of Medicine research may explain why that happens and could lead to a way to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVA’s Harald Sontheimer, PhD, and graduate student Lata Chaunsali and their colleagues found that the failure to recognize family, friends and caregivers is caused by the breakdown of protective “nets” that surround neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing the loss of these nets in lab mice protected the mice from losing their memories of previous social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer an exciting target for the development of new treatments to benefit Alzheimer’s patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding a structural change that explains a specific memory loss in Alzheimer’s is very exciting,” said Sontheimer, chair of UVA’s Department of Neuroscience and member of the UVA Brain Institute. “It is a completely new target, and we already have suitable drug candidates in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s: A Growing Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s affects 55 million people around the world, and that number is expected to grow by 35% in the next five years alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, UVA has established the Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases as part of its Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. The institute aims to accelerate the development of new treatments and cures for some of the world’s most challenging diseases, including Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sontheimer’s new work sheds important light on the development of the disease. He and his team previously revealed the importance of what are called “perineuronal nets” in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These net-like structures surround nerve cells called neurons and perform a critical barrier function that lets neurons communicate correctly. These communications allow the neurons to form and store new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on those results, Sontheimer and his collaborators suspected that disruptions of the nets could be a critical turning point in Alzheimer’s. Their latest work bears that out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that lab mice that had faulty nets lost their ability to remember other mice – their “social memory” – even as they could still form new memories of objects in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors what is seen in people with Alzheimer’s, where social memory often fails before object memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sontheimer and his team then used “MMP inhibitors” – a class of drugs already being investigated for their potential to treat cancer and arthritis – to see if they could prevent the loss of the perineuronal nets. It worked. The approach staved off the degradation of the nets and preserved the mice’s social memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Alzheimer’s disease, people have trouble remembering their family and friends due to the loss of a memory known as social memory. We found that the net-like coating known as perineuronal nets protects these social memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our research with mice, when we kept these brain structures safe early in life, the mice suffering from this disease were better at remembering their social interactions,” Chaunsali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research will help us get closer to finding a new, non-traditional way to treat or better yet prevent Alzheimer’s disease, something that is much needed today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes the scientists saw in the mice’s brains align with those seen in human patients with Alzheimer’s, suggesting that the targeting the nets in people could provide similar benefits. Developing a treatment based on the findings will require additional research, but Sontheimer and Chaunsali are hopeful about what the future could hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we have drugs that can delay the loss of perineuronal nets, and thereby delay memory loss in disease, more research needs to be done regarding safety and effectiveness of our approach before this can be considered in humans,” Sontheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most interesting aspect of our research is the fact that the loss of perineuronal nets observed in our studies occurred completely independent of amyloid and plaque pathology, adding to the suspicion that those protein aggregates may not be causal of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article is open access, meaning it is free to read.

We investigate the role of perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized coats of extracellular matrix around hippocampal CA2 neurons in AD-associated social memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We utilized 5XFAD mouse model of AD and employed immunohistochemistry, microscopy, bulk RNA-sequencing, animal behavior, gene-knockout, and drug-treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AD mice showed profound disruption of CA2 PNNs with concomitant impairment of social cognition memory. Genetic or enzymatic CA2 PNN disruption in wild-type mice mimicked these impairments. Transcriptomic analysis shows upregulation of PNN-cleaving matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in AD mice causing disequilibrium of PNN synthesis and remodeling. Chronic inhibition of MMPs retains CA2 PNN and delays social memory impairments in 5XFAD mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AD-associated social memory impairments are caused by loss of CA2 PNNs. Inhibition of PNN proteolysis by MMPs preserves social memory, suggesting PNN as a promising therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBmeno2SUJjaW1PMU5rNks4ZHpVVFJYNF9EdzFERE1Ud2xTTFU0cEdZNXVKb3Q4d1ZDYUxrNXpLSWUzRHpJN3NTNVluOGZSWHBJQklCejhzVWxTS1dCb01hOUlwUHdBbEpET1kxZ0MtTFBwZw</guid></item><item><title>专家表示，老年人需要6种维生素和矿物质- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/want-to-age-gracefully-add-these-6-vitamins-and-minerals-to-your-diet-now/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Aging gracefully requires taking care of your body as it begins to change.

Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that an unprocessed diet contains about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet contains less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" target="_self"&gt;400 to 420mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of foods. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in sports and exercise medicine, said that magnesium can be found in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a supplement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084641/" target="_self"&gt;body can't absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins, such as meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, notes that individuals taking medications that block B12 absorption, such as omeprazole or metformin, may also require a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" target="_self"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are recommended to take 1,200mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" target="_self"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often referred to as the "sunshine vitamin" because it is typically absorbed through the skin by simply being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/are-you-getting-enough-sun-heres-what-to-know-about-vitamin-d-supplements/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, making it a crucial nutrient for maintaining bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" target="_self"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." target="_self"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/what-to-know-multivitamins-memory-brain-health-age/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, as the Cleveland Clinic points out, the body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22isn%27t%20able%20to%20produce%20enough%20omega-3s%20on%20its%20own%22}" target="_self"&gt;is unable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_self"&gt; to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/should-take-omega-3-supplements-benefits-drawbacks/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." target="_self"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts, but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" target="_self"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/how-weightlifting-benefits-you-during-the-aging-process/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other healthy habits, obtaining the right minerals and vitamins can improve your overall health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in your diet each day. Consult your doctor before taking any supplements to determine how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many factors that can lead to this, one of the more common reasons is because when you get older your body has a slower metabolism and less stomach acid, meaning absorbing nutrients is harder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you may experience if you're not getting enough of the vitamins listed here include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle cramps or weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry and brittle hair and nails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more symptoms you could experience as a result of vitamin deficiency and any concerns should be brought up with your doctor before taking any supplements or changing your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPcnU0TVVKN09rcHRkMWJpZTJ5ci1jTWtXM0NhRlMxVmRGblVIdHdEb1IyN3ltb2M4NlhLc2VhUDc2TElqdDNENW1yV1o0dmltb0JoYWVJQS00UWF0VUZDQUthUWRkaVJzTXR2bUtFTEd1MUZLZTJPbExMNFplYmpqQ2tTS2NmV1ViQ2JiSnNZdVd4ZFFwYV90aU5hdFZaM3ZsYURuUVhRdm41Yng4a1NTdl9n</guid></item><item><title>正如最近的一项研究所表明的那样，大脑训练真的可以减少大脑衰老十年吗？ - The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/can-brain-training-really-shave-ten-years-off-brain-ageing-as-a-recent-study-suggests-268904</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ten-week online brain training programme helped older adults’ brains act as though they were a decade younger, a recent study has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like exercise for the body, regular &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/brain-training-7463"&gt;mental workouts&lt;/a&gt; can help keep the brain in shape. As we age, brain processes that support memory, attention and decision-making can become less efficient. Keeping the mind active is thought to build a reserve that helps people cope better with these age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that people who stay mentally, physically and socially active have a lower risk of developing dementia. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21282661/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 older adults, those who engaged in regular aerobic exercise had larger brain volumes and better cognitive performance than those who were less active, reversing age-related loss in brain volume over a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163714000208"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that brain training can improve older adults’ cognitive performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; adds to what we know by testing whether brain training programmes – BrainHQ, in this instance – can change the brain’s chemistry, offering biological clues about how brain training might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrainHQ is a brain training app that offers short, game-like exercises that train cognitive skills such as attention, memory and brain speed. As users improve, the challenges get harder, pushing the brain to adapt – much like increasing the weights during a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-two healthy adults from Canada, 65 and older, took part. Half of them completed brain training exercises using BrainHQ for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, over ten weeks. The other half, a comparison group, spent the same amount of time playing games designed just for entertainment, such as solitaire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see whether the programme made a difference to the brain, all participants had specialised scans before and after the ten weeks of training. These scans can detect tiny chemical changes in brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which plays an important role in attention, learning and memory. Those who completed the speed-based exercises showed stronger activity in this area compared to those in the comparison group. The change in brain chemicals seen is described by the researchers as equivalent to shaving ten years off their biological age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ageing and cognitive decline (including Alzheimer’s disease) are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1913629/"&gt;often linked to reduced activity&lt;/a&gt; in this part of the brain. Strengthening it may therefore help delay or reduce cognitive decline and lower the risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the results look promising, we should be careful about how we interpret them. The study measured many different outcomes. Although the brain training group showed increased activity compared with their own baseline, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the study looked at so many outcomes and involved only a small number of people, some of these changes may simply be due to chance rather than real effects of the training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;With ageing, there is often a decline in part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/retired-couple-holding-hands-looking-each-1272275779"&gt;LightField Studios/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a small study involving healthy, mostly white older adults, and it looked at one specific brain training app. The findings may not apply to people with memory problems or to other types of brain-training programmes, or to longer-term outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intervention is relatively short. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534025/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that most interventions aiming to improve cognitive performance that are successful typically last at least four to six months. Longer-term participation is almost certainly key to achieving lasting improvement in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies like this rely on brain scans as early indicators of benefit, but it remains to be seen whether these biological changes translate into lasting improvements in functioning. Researchers are testing whether similar brain-training programmes can help people who show early signs of dementia. These studies will reveal whether boosting brain activity this way can slow cognitive decline in those already showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interventions – such as the one tested that required two and a half hours of training per week – may not suit everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, people with existing cognitive concerns who want to improve their cognitive wellbeing may struggle to access digital programmes. They may need more &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(25)00096-0/fulltext?rss=yes"&gt;community-based, supportive and lower-intensity interventions&lt;/a&gt;. To be an effective dementia programme, recruitment needs to be inclusive, especially reaching people from underserved groups who are at the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive ageing is shaped by many factors – including physical activity, social connection, healthy diet and mental wellbeing – so brain training is likely to be just one part of a broader approach to supporting brain health and dementia prevention. Keeping the mind active may not stop ageing, but it could help the brain stay younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Researchers at the University of Nottingham say they’ve come up with a new type of gel that can repair and rebuild tooth enamel — a potentially game-changing treatment, since dentistry today is largely limited to preventative care and halting the progress of decay, rather than reversing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64982-y" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the protein-based gel uses the human body’s natural growth processes from early in life to form a durable coating and fill in small cavities in teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;After being coated on a target tooth’s surface, it extracts calcium and phosphate ions from saliva to encourage new growth of minerals. These minerals then merge with the existing tooth, effectively allowing it to regrow lost enamel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While the gel has yet to be tested in human mouths, it has shown promise on extracted human teeth in a lab. That’s huge, since enamel can’t naturally regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The gel could also be used to cover dentine, the bony material beneath the enamel that can be exposed due to enamel degradation, leading to infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel,” explained lead author and University of Nottingham postdoctoral fellow Abshar Hasan in a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/goodbye-cavities-scientists-just-found-a-way-to-regrow-tooth-enamel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Lab experiments showed that a thin, protective layer formed within just weeks of applying the gel to extracted human molar teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating ‘real-life situations’ such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel,” Hasan added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The growth actually happens within a week,” University of Nottingham biomedical engineering professor Alvaro Mata &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2502731-cavities-could-be-prevented-by-a-gel-that-restores-tooth-enamel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Mata and his colleagues are looking to commercialize the product as part of a new startup called Mintech-Bio. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, plenty of work will still be required until we can determine whether it’s safe and effective for humans. Clinical trials are scheduled for early next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our findings demonstrate a capacity to grow enamel-like structures under conditions that closely imitate various mechanical and chemical challenges found in the mouth,” the researchers wrote in their paper. “However, these tests do not fully recreate the complexity of the in vivo oral environment and, consequently, to fully confirm the capacity to regenerate natural enamel would require in vivo validation, which we envision to pursue in future work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Nonetheless, the team hopes that their “technology could potentially provide a one-pot solution for the regeneration of dental enamel independently of the level of tooth erosion.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers have found that toothpaste made from keratin, a protein naturally present in hair, skin, and wool, could both protect and repair damaged teeth while offering a sustainable alternative to traditional dental treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from King's College London discovered that keratin can rebuild tooth enamel and halt the early stages of decay. When keratin interacts with the minerals found in saliva, it forms a coating that closely replicates the composition and protective function of natural enamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sherif Elsharkawy, senior author and consultant in prosthodontics at King's College London, explained: "Unlike bones and hair, enamel does not regenerate, once it is lost, it's gone forever."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting Teeth from Erosion and Cavities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday habits, from drinking acidic beverages to poor brushing routines, wear away enamel over time. This erosion can lead to sensitivity, discomfort, and eventually tooth loss. While fluoride toothpaste helps slow this process, the keratin-based formulation in the new study went further, completely preventing it in laboratory tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keratin creates a dense, mineralized barrier over the tooth's surface, blocking the nerve channels responsible for sensitivity. This not only protects against further damage but also provides immediate relief from discomfort, addressing both cause and symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision the treatment being available in two forms: a daily-use toothpaste or a professional gel applied by dentists, similar to nail varnish. According to the team, keratin-based enamel repair products could be accessible to the public within two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Keratin Helps Teeth Heal Themselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;, scientists extracted keratin from wool and applied it to tooth surfaces. When exposed to the natural minerals present in saliva, the protein organized itself into a crystal-like structure that mimicked real enamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this microscopic framework continued to attract calcium and phosphate ions, gradually forming a durable, enamel-like layer. The finding marks an important milestone in regenerative dentistry and brings researchers closer to treatments that can rebuild the tooth's protective shell rather than just patching damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable, Natural, and Clinically Effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara Gamea, PhD researcher at King's College London and the study's first author, said: "Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments. Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the color of the original tooth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research addresses growing concerns about the environmental impact of dental materials and the long-term use of fluoride. By using recycled biological materials, this approach could make dental care more eco-friendly while reducing dependence on synthetic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Era of Biotech Dentistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This technology bridges the gap between biology and dentistry, providing an eco-friendly biomaterial that mirrors natural processes," said Gamea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elsharkawy added: "We are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body's own materials. With further development and the right industry partnerships, we may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work received support from the Wellcome Trust Seed Award, King's College London, the Academy of Medical Sciences 'Starter Grants for Clinical Lecturers', and the National Institute of Health Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado toast didn’t become famous just for its good looks; it delivers real nutritional benefits that make it a breakfast worth considering. This simple meal offers healthy fats, fiber and key vitamins that help keep you full and energized.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The star of avocado toast is, of course, the avocado. This creamy fruit is celebrated for its “good” fat content. “Avocado toast offers heart-healthy monounsaturated fats,” says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These fats play many important roles in the body. They support brain function, help reduce inflammation and assist with the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Avocados can also help support healthy cholesterol levels,” Young adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Source of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feeling full &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; supporting healthy digestion often comes down to one key nutrient: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados are a natural source of fiber, and when you spread them on whole-grain bread, you get even more of this important carbohydrate. As Young notes, “Pairing avocado with whole-grain bread adds additional fiber for a balanced meal or snack.” This balanced breakfast offers two types of fiber—soluble and insoluble—that make it a digestive dream team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soluble fiber, found in avocados, does more than just support digestion. This type of fiber binds to cholesterol in your digestive system, helping to lower LDL (the “bad” cholesterol). Insoluble fiber, abundant in whole-grain bread, adds bulk to your stool and keeps things moving smoothly through your digestive system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond fats and fiber, avocados deliver a wide array of essential micronutrients. They are an excellent source of potassium, a mineral crucial for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. They also contain vitamins K, C, E and several B vitamins, all of which play vital roles in everything from bone health to energy production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While avocado toast has been stealing the spotlight, peanut butter toast has been quietly holding its own as a reliable, nutritious and cost-effective option. It’s a classic for a reason and offers a different, yet equally compelling, set of health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Source of Plant-Based Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most significant advantages of peanut butter toast is its protein content. “Peanut butter toast is higher in protein (about 6 grams per 2 tablespoons), while avocado toast provides an edge on fiber content and is lower in protein,” explains &lt;a href="https://nicoleibarrard.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Ibarra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nicoleibarrard.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Protein is key for building and repairing tissues, and it also contributes to feeling full.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Peanut butter can be an easy way to add some protein and healthy fats to your morning meal. It can help you stay satisfied for longer and helps keep blood sugar more balanced when compared to toast alone or with jam on top,” adds &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Source of Healthy Fats and Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to avocados, peanuts are a source of healthy fats. “Peanut butter toast provides plant-based protein, healthy fats and nutrients like vitamin E, magnesium and niacin,” says Young. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage, while magnesium is involved in many biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle function and energy creation. Niacin (vitamin B3) also helps convert food into energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Convenient &amp;amp; Cost-Effective  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Health and wellness don”t have to be complicated or expensive, and peanut butter toast is a great example of this. A jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread are staples in many households because they’re shelf-stable and tend to be lower-cost ingredients. Its simplicity is part of its genius: you get a balanced mix of protein, fats and carbs with minimal effort.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-do-you-need-to-choose"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Do You Need to Choose? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, which toast should you be eating? The short answer is: You don’t have to pick a side. Both avocado toast and peanut butter toast can fit perfectly into a healthy eating pattern. The “better” choice really depends on what your body needs at that moment and what your personal health goals are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of seeing it as a competition, think of them as two great options you can customize to be even more nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To level up your avocado toast:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a source of protein&lt;/strong&gt;. Since avocado toast is lower in protein, give it a lift. Young suggests, “You can add protein to your avocado toast by adding an egg.” A sprinkle of hemp seeds, chickpeas or a side of black beans also works well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on some seeds&lt;/strong&gt;. Chia seeds or flaxseed can add a bit more fiber, protein and healthy omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add some veggies. &lt;/strong&gt;Top it with sliced tomatoes, radish or spinach for extra vitamins and a satisfying crunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To elevate your peanut butter toast:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase the fiber content&lt;/strong&gt;. Add sliced bananas, berries or a sprinkle of seeds on top of the peanut butter to increase the fiber content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the labels.&lt;/strong&gt; Opt for peanut butter made with no added sugars and minimal sodium when possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spice it up&lt;/strong&gt;. A dash of cinnamon can add flavor and antioxidants without added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, both avocado toast and peanut butter toast are excellent choices. They offer a fantastic combination of carbohydrates for energy, healthy fats for satiety, and a host of valuable nutrients. The best option for you depends on your needs and goals. If you’re heading out for a workout and need lasting energy and protein, peanut butter toast might be the way to go. If you’re looking for a meal that packs a fiber and micronutrient punch, avocado toast could be the better pick. As Young puts it, “Both avocado toast and peanut butter toast can be healthy choices—it depends on what you’re looking for nutritionally.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no need to declare a single winner in this breakfast battle. Enjoy the one you love, or better yet, enjoy both by rotating them throughout your week. By making small additions and choosing high-quality ingredients, you can ensure your favorite toast is a delicious and powerful part of your healthy eating plan.&lt;br&gt;

He emphasised that if someone frequently experiences sleep disruptions, it should not be taken lightly. A proper evaluation should be scheduled, as he noted that sleep is closely tied to heart health, and any unresolved sleep problems may lead to serious cardiac issues in the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signs you need to pay attention to&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matta revealed that sleep-related problems can show up in various ways: some occur during sleep, some appear immediately after waking up, and others affect your health more gradually over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as you wake up, your own body gives clues that sleep wasn't as restorative as it should have been. Dr Matta urged that everyone should pay attention to how they feel after waking up in the morning, as some signs of poor sleep may also indicate heart-related concerns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pay attention to morning symptoms. If you're waking up with headaches, feeling unrested despite adequate time in bed, or experiencing a racing heart or palpitations, these could be red flags," The cardiologist explained. "Excessive daytime fatigue that interferes with daily activities isn't normal; it often indicates poor sleep quality that's stressing your cardiovascular system.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While post-sleep signs are usually more subtle and sometimes may be confused with tiredness, there are some sleep problems which show up as major disturbances during the night. The cardiologist shared, “Loud snoring, gasping, or choking during sleep are warning signs of sleep apnea, which dramatically increases risk for hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other warning signs include difficulty controlling blood pressure despite medication, unexplained weight gain, or increased anxiety and irritability, as per Dr Matta. These are more long-term in nature, in contrast to the immediate signs mentioned earlier. But they all affect metabolic and cardiovascular health, and the cardiologist warned against ignoring them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to improve sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/10/original/sleep_on_timeee_1762789811147.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Follow these habits to improve your sleep quality.

(Picture credit: Made with Chat GPT )&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Matta recommended these 4 habits, which help to improve your sleep quality. Try adding them to your daily routine: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Establish a fixed wake time: This is more important than a fixed bedtime because it anchors your circadian rhythm. Within a week or two, one will naturally start to feel sleepy at an appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Sunlight exposure: Get morning sunlight exposure within 30 minutes of waking; it sets your internal clock and improves sleep quality that night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Do physical activity: Incorporate 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days, but finish at least three hours before bedtime. Exercise is one of the most powerful sleep aids, and it directly benefits the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Create wind-down routine: 15 minutes of light reading or gentle stretching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

                The Food and Drug Administration is lifting stringent warnings on hormone therapy products prescribed for symptoms of menopause.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration says it is removing the black box safety warnings from all hormone therapy creams, pills and other treatments prescribed to ease the symptoms of menopause and perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The prominent warnings said these therapies could raise the risks for some cancers, dementia, heart attacks and strokes. That, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CBS News' Norah O'Donnell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scared women from using drugs that could in fact improve their health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits," Makary said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA convened an expert panel in July to discuss removing them from at least low-dose vaginal estrogen. The agency then &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2025-N-2589-0001/comment" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;opened a docket &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to solicit comments from the public and received nearly 3,000 by the Sept. 24 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its formal comment, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or ACOG, wrote that it has "long encouraged" the agency to reevaluate warning labels on low-dose estrogen products administered vaginally, but it considers those separate from systemic estrogen products that deliver the hormone throughout the body, such as pills and patches.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Doctors had gone back and forth about the risks versus benefits of hormone replacement therapy for years. In 2002, researchers rang the alarm about them because a long-term study called &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Women's Health Initiative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of cancer and stroke. Since then, additional research has shown those risks were overstated, and the therapy can instead reduce heart disease when prescribed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although doctors have pushed to have the black box warnings removed, they say the special panel the FDA convened in July deviated from the usual process for making such changes and lacked the rigor of the usual approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While we appreciate the FDA Expert Panel's interest in reevaluating the label warnings on hormone therapy, a brief panel such as the two-hour July 17th Expert Panel should not be considered an adequate substitute for an advisory committee meeting," ACOG wrote in its formal comment to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FDA advisory committees are made up of independent experts who evaluate scientific presentations, discuss and debate the evidence on a given topic and then vote on recommendations for the FDA. The agency doesn't always follow its committees' recommendations, but it usually does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Forgoing the advisory committee process runs counter to the Agency's stated goal to increase transparency." ACOG writes. "Therefore, ACOG urges the FDA to delve deeper into the benefits of low-dose vaginal estrogen for [genitourinary syndrome of menopause] GSM and systemic estrogen therapy for vasomotor symptoms by convening separate advisory committee meetings, including opportunities for public engagement, before making decisions on possible labeling changes for these distinct menopausal hormone therapy options."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In an email to NPR, the agency shared several studies in support of its decision. The studies showed that these hormone therapies reduced the risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8885820/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2005736/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198011203032102" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hip fracture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The findings aren't new, however, and were published between 1980 and 1996. The agency also cited an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15209595/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;analysis of 30 studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1966 through 2003 that showed starting hormone replacement therapy earlier could save lives. It was published in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

This transformation is made possible by an internal mechanism sensitive to pressure and changes in weight. Each piece is uniquely defined by its function and material composition. Imagine a piece with an upholstered top and metal base that shifts effortlessly between two forms, like a pouf or side table that blossoms into a lounge chair.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7102d6_406" data-ic-marker="319649_397"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775616_81_139276_0N7ZML8KN.jpg"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad_wrap induced_ad" data-ad-type="4" id="rx2OpknLKU6DneXeIggug_0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote id="4ed7d_375_c"&gt;The concept was born from an exploration of mechanics, inspired by a deep fascination with movement and the natural ability of plants and trees to grow, bloom, and evolve. In these designs, the technical elements that enable transformation are not hidden, they are celebrated. The mechanism becomes part of the visual language and is leading for the aesthetic and form.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="726960_5924" data-ic-marker="da1c3e_259"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775626_81_139276_nWKHCNsSg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5c7bab_1327" data-ic-marker="659a9a_301"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775621_81_139276_lOHyTMk5O.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ade923_5459" data-ic-marker="7bc722_470"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775627_81_139276_cUOoySafI.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7e1217_1869" data-ic-marker="276f07_393"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775619_81_139276_qlaSbOU2M.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7cb63e_4192" data-ic-marker="2fc440_447"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1775622_81_139276_lOHyTMk5O.jpg"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad_wrap induced_ad" data-ad-type="6" id="RlXPaRey3kWIM5bGPA6DQg_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote id="c76576_991_c"&gt;This innovative chair effortlessly transforms from an upholstered table or ottoman into a comfortable armchair.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)&lt;/em&gt;, was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology. Their findings highlight two enzymes, PDIA1 and PDIA5, that play a key role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enzymes That Protect Cancer Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, PDIA1 and PDIA5 act like molecular bodyguards for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that drives prostate cancer growth. When these enzymes are blocked, the AR loses stability and breaks apart, causing cancer cells to die and tumors to shrink in both lab cultures and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered that combining drugs that inhibit PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a standard medication for prostate cancer, made the treatment significantly more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that prostate cancer cells use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease," explains senior author Professor Luke Selth, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumors more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Promising Combination Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Professor Jianling Xie, who began the research at Flinders University, said the combination therapy worked well in both patient-derived tumor samples and mouse models, showing strong potential for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting step forward," says Dr. Xie, now based at South China University of Technology. "Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupting Cancer's Energy Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that PDIA1 and PDIA5 do more than just protect the AR. They help cancer cells manage stress and maintain their energy production systems. When the enzymes are blocked, the mitochondria -- the cell's power generators -- become damaged, leading to oxidative stress that further weakens the cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets," adds Dr. Xie. "It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps Toward Safer Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Selth notes that while current PDIA1 and PDIA5 inhibitors are promising, they still need to be refined for patient use. Some existing compounds can affect healthy cells, so future studies will focus on designing safer and more selective versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments such as hormone therapy and AR-targeting drugs have greatly improved survival rates, resistance to these therapies remains a major challenge. This new discovery may help overcome that resistance and improve treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research received support from Cancer Council SA, Cancer Council NSW, the Flinders Foundation, the Movember Foundation, the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, The Hospital Research Foundation, Cancer Australia, Masonic Charities Trust, the Australian Research Council, and several international funding organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

Even so, specialists say the country is dangerously underprepared for what’s ahead, a crisis that will only intensify as the U.S. population grows older. About half a million Americans develop &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/10/15/alcohol-dementia-risk/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; each year, a number projected to roughly double by 2060, according to research published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03340-9?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="EOWVGWNPVBFQJFXQ5J7MEWON2U" data-contentid="EOWVGWNPVBFQJFXQ5J7MEWON2U" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;The situation is especially concerning in the nation’s capital, where an estimated 16 percent of D.C.’s 84,000 or so&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;seniors are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease  — a rate that is higher than any U.S. county or state, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. The rate is driven in part by the city’s majority Black senior population, a group that is twice as likely as their White counterparts to develop dementia and more &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/27/us/living-alone-aging.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;likely to live alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-hKGRld PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-iunXNr PJLV-ibtxKyY-css"&gt;&lt;h4 class="wpds-c-eTZSFW"&gt;How is dementia detected?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-iqJNYu"&gt;Health care professionals use tests to help detect signs of thinking, memory or cognitive impairments.

He told the story of a man who spent his final years in the village savoring those&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cigars. Smoking wasn’t healthy, van Hal admitted, but it brought comfort. He urged others in the room to rethink dementia not as the end of personhood but as a stage of life. What might appear to be aimless wandering, he said, could simply reflect a resident’s wish to take a walk or go outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-hKGRld PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-iunXNr PJLV-ibtxKyY-css"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-dlVQnp"&gt;Example 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wpds-c-eTZSFW"&gt;Copy this picture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="var(--wpds-colors-gray20)" fill="none" stroke-width="1" role="img" aria-labelledby="title desc"&gt;&lt;rect x="20" y="80"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;line x1="20" y1="80" x2="70" y2="30"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="120" y1="80" x2="170" y2="30"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="70" y1="30" x2="170" y2="30"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="120" y1="80" x2="170" y2="30"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="120" y1="180" x2="170" y2="130"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="170" y1="30" x2="170" y2="130"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="120" y1="80" x2="120" y2="180"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="20" y1="80" x2="20" y2="180"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line x1="20" y1="180" x2="120" y2="180"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-eFOdFN"&gt;MOCA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="GXO6CEC3T5HG7EK6YM2RZO4IMM" data-contentid="GXO6CEC3T5HG7EK6YM2RZO4IMM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;“People are not stupid.

They cook meals together, tend gardens and shop at the on-site grocery store. Each household includes a small team of caregivers, nurses and activity staff who support residents throughout the day. Most remain for about two years, with the aim of living comfortably until death rather than undergoing intensive medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="MM4H5CMFD5CPNJKTDYMRWLEQ5A" data-contentid="MM4H5CMFD5CPNJKTDYMRWLEQ5A" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;Van Hal acknowledged that the model doesn’t always translate easily across borders; in the Netherlands, the Hogeweyk is covered by national health insurance.

He suspects his father, whose medical practice he took over, began to develop the condition in his 80s. He recalled encouraging his father to come into the office every day so that he could maintain a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="THNSOSH2WJAWZGZMUQMOOCKRUE" data-contentid="THNSOSH2WJAWZGZMUQMOOCKRUE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;“He would sit and he would greet people,” he said. “He wasn’t involved in medical care anymore, but he would say hi to people, and it took him back 30 or 40 years in his brain. And that’s often the part of the brain that’s working beautifully. He might not remember what he had for breakfast, but he could do a great job talking about a patient that he took care of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-hKGRld PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV wpds-c-iunXNr PJLV-ibtxKyY-css"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-dlVQnp"&gt;Example 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wpds-c-eTZSFW"&gt;Name these animals&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src="./img/animals.png" class="wpds-c-eQbFhr"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-eFOdFN"&gt;MOCA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="UIDCKM2GYBCDJFR7ZGPMUDIZAI" data-contentid="UIDCKM2GYBCDJFR7ZGPMUDIZAI" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;To create a dementia village in D.C.,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;van Hal said, leaders shouldn’t attempt to copy the Hogeweyk brick by brick but instead rethink elderly care entirely — treating residents as individuals first and tailoring the model to local systems, resources and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="PGLWFONZVRFXNC6WYCKCTSRUAY" data-contentid="PGLWFONZVRFXNC6WYCKCTSRUAY" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;“Yes, you can do this in the United States,” he said. “Will it be easy?

They’ll stay out of a more acute setting and cost the public health system less. That’s the vision there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="Q25TSVFIYNCCPAXOBGHBBCGV4Q" data-contentid="Q25TSVFIYNCCPAXOBGHBBCGV4Q" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;Iona, founded 50 years ago in Ward 3, has made a national case for housing inspired by dementia villages. In 2023, CEO Joon Bang asked Congress for $3 million to launch a hybrid version in D.C. for older adults living alone with dementia and no familial support. The plan would let residents  spend their days at Iona’s adult day health centers and return in the evenings to a group home staffed with trained caregivers. Bang, 45, said the goal was to expand housing options while linking seniors to Iona’s existing programs offering meals, activities and skilled care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="QSUWGI5WD5FRDOVV72RXVEA6OU" data-contentid="QSUWGI5WD5FRDOVV72RXVEA6OU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;The request took on added resonance months later, when it was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/24/kay-granger-texas-congresswoman-age-facility/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that former U.S. representative Kay Granger (R-Texas), then the appropriations committee chair, was living in an independent senior facility and experiencing dementia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-bTCZLY wpds-c-bTCZLY-idZwvW-type-default wpds-c-bTCZLY-ibtxKyY-css"&gt;&lt;figure id="image-FB3YYJI3V73W6VNPZXYWWL46XY" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-XgEPk-type-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MZekd5nyD_lnP8-0yBf6nzYi57c=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/FB3YYJI3V73W6VNPZXYWWL46XY.jpg&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048 1x" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MZekd5nyD_lnP8-0yBf6nzYi57c=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/FB3YYJI3V73W6VNPZXYWWL46XY.jpg&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wpds-c-kaVXjn wpds-c-kaVXjn-fTrHqK-type-large"&gt;Iona CEO Joon Bang.

Christina Prather, the clinical director of the GWU’s Institute for Brain Health and Dementia, cautioned that without follow-up care, a tool like the MoCA can lead to false alarms, especially for people with less formal education or for whom English is not a first language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="FML73GDD6VB75LCCNGF55P4CTE" data-contentid="FML73GDD6VB75LCCNGF55P4CTE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;“That’s one of the reasons to bring this forward to your clinician, to understand, ‘Is this something I need to be concerned about or not?’” she said. “But it opens the door to conversations that allow us to all understand how to meet the needs of this aging population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="WLVLIICVRZDTBLNWTTEALOGZPA" data-contentid="WLVLIICVRZDTBLNWTTEALOGZPA" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;Meeting those needs, she added, requires building “an age-friendly community integrated with health care” rather than siloed services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5I4EHCQRCRE5ZOMI4CTXHBEJXY" data-contentid="5I4EHCQRCRE5ZOMI4CTXHBEJXY" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-iiIsQwS-css"&gt;“The structures we have in place will not be able to accommodate what’s coming,” she said.

And they’re mostly occurring in women, Baiu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Overall, the number of lung cancer incidences is slowly decreasing but it’s not decreasing nearly as fast in women as men,” she said. “We’re seeing a shift in trends now and seeing patients who are younger and patients who are never smokers, who we never used to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cancer experts say radon levels in the home, air pollution and genetic mutations &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/not-just-smoking-heres-causes-090126684.html" data-ylk="slk:are mainly driving this trend.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;are mainly driving this trend.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Radon is odorless, colorless radioactive gas that forms when radioactive metals – such as uranium, thorium and radium – break down in rocks, soil and groundwater, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radon/what-radon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/a&gt; People are typically exposed to radon through cracks and gaps in buildings and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christy Houvouras, 37, reads to her son before bedtime in Huntington, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Houvouras suspects she was exposed to radon in her childhood home in Greenville, South Carolina, which the EPA has designated as having &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radon/epa-map-radon-zones-0#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,implement%20radon%2Dresistant%20building%20codes." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the highest potential for elevated indoor radon levels.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the highest potential for elevated indoor radon levels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The crazy thing about lung cancer is that you can be exposed at a young age and then you won’t have a developing tumor until decades later,” she said. Her diagnosis led Houvouras to install a radon mitigation system in her home to protect her 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite being a lung cancer patient, Houvouras still considers herself lucky. Her cancer was caught as stage 1, which meant she only needed surgery to remove the tumor and 20% of her lung without further treatments like chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within three weeks of her diagnosis, she was recovering at home from surgery, cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At stage 1, lung cancer can be surgically removed, usually without the need for further treatment like chemotherapy,” said Baiu, who is also an assistant professor at Ohio State College of Medicine. “At stage 2, the lung cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and patients will need systemic therapy in addition to surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christy Houvouras plays doctors with her 3-year-old daughter at her home in Huntington, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to catch lung cancer early &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/lung-cancer-screening" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:but annual screening recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;but annual screening recommendations&lt;/a&gt; only target patients who smoke or have a smoking history. That’s why cancer experts say knowing the signs and symptoms of lung cancer could make all the difference for nonsmoking patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the most common symptoms of lung cancer include a persistent cough, chest pain, unexplained weight loss, shortness of breath and new onset wheezing, among others, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Houvouras, it was a swollen area on her chest. She brought it up to her obstetrician during an annual wellness visit, which kicked off multiple tests and scans that ultimately confirmed her cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These “accidental” cancer diagnoses among young, nonsmoker patients are more common than people might think, Baiu said. She urges patients to advocate for themselves and their health, as Houvouras did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Christy is the perfect example of health. She exercises, she eats healthy, she never smokes, never drinks, she does everything by the book, and she was 36. Nobody would have expected lung cancer in her," she said. “She advocated for herself, which I think is really important and I encourage patients to do as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/10/lung-cancer-young-women/87107857007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lung cancer is becoming more common for young, healthy women.

Leonardo da Vinci &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/leonardo-da-vincis-codex-flight-birds"&gt;dreamed&lt;/a&gt; of gliding machines that would mimic birds. Today, the close study of animals and plants is leading to inventions such as soft batteries and water-walking robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Cassandra Donatelli, a biologist at the University of Washington, Tacoma and an author of a recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/icb/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/icb/icaf128/8196179?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the burgeoning field of “bioinspiration,” credits the trend to sophisticated new tools as well as a new spirit of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;“It’s huge,” she said. “We have a biomechanics lab here where we have six or seven engineers and 10 biologists. We’re all physically in the same building, together doing work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Despite its promise, the future of bioinspiration is cloudy. The Trump administration has proposed cutting the research budget of the National Science Foundation by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/science/trump-science-budget-cuts.html"&gt;55 percent&lt;/a&gt;, directing remaining funds to a few fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Bioinspiration, which has thrived on this funding, may lose out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;“That work will suffer with N.S.F.’s new priorities,” said Duncan Irschick, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts. “I sincerely worry about handing the mantle of bioinspired research to China.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Here are some inventions, both new and historical, that have drawn inspiration from nature’s creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt; &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In 1941, the Swiss inventor &lt;a href="https://www.invent.org/blog/inventors/walk-in-the-woods-velcro"&gt;George de Mestral&lt;/a&gt; went on a hunting trip. Along the way, burdock burrs stuck to his pants and to the fur of his dog. Curious about their power to cling, de Mestral put the burrs under a microscope. He saw &lt;a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.17396"&gt;thousands of tiny hooks&lt;/a&gt;. The sight led him to imagine a new kind of fastener, one that wouldn’t rely on knots or glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;A few years later, de Mestral discovered a substance that could make that idea real: nylon. The synthetic fiber could be permanently bent into a hook. De Mestral found that nylon hooks readily attached to fabric and could be peeled away. In 1955, he filed a patent for his invention, which he called Velcro, a combination of the French words “velour” (“velvet”) and “crochet” (“hooks”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;When engineers in Japan created a fleet of high-speed trains in the 1980s and 1990s, they also created some unexpected problems. A train traveling through a tunnel faster than 220 miles an hour compressed the air ahead of it. When the pressure wave reached the tunnel exit, it created a sonic boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;An engineer named Eiji Nakatsu cast about for a way to make the trains quiet. “The question then occurred to me — is there some living thing that manages sudden changes in air resistance as a part of daily life?” Mr. Nakatsu &lt;a href="https://www.japanfs.org/en/news/archives/news_id027795.html"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; in a 2005 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Mr. Nakatsu was not just an engineer, but also an avid birder. As he pondered the question, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/laban.351"&gt;the kingfisher&lt;/a&gt; came to mind. When the bird dives at high speed to catch fish, its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6544885/"&gt;beak slips into the water&lt;/a&gt; without a splash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;So Mr. Nakatsu and his colleagues built train engines with rounded, tapered front ends. Their kingfisher-beak shape reduced the air pressure in tunnels by 30 percent, making the trains quieter and more efficient, even as they traveled more rapidly through tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In the 1990s, Frank Fish took a close look at the massive knobs that stud the leading edge of humpback whale fins. Dr. Fish, a biologist at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23792-9_1"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that these tubercles significantly improve the whales’ performance by keeping water flowing smoothly over their fins, generating extra lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Dr. Fish and his colleagues patented their discovery, which has since been adopted by engineers to improve a long list of devices. Tubercles extend the life span of wind turbine blades, for example, and make industrial ceiling fans more efficient. They can even be found on surfboard fins and truck mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;A gecko’s foot is covered by a half-million tiny hairs, each of which splits into hundreds of branches. When a gecko slaps its foot on a wall, many of the branches push tightly against the surface. Each branch creates a weak molecular attraction to the wall, and together they generate a powerful force, yet the gecko can easily pull its foot away in a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Dr. Irschick and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201306259"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; a fabric that mimics these forces, which they called &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/news/geckskin"&gt;Geckskin&lt;/a&gt;. A piece the size of an index card can hold 700 pounds to a glass surface and be moved without leaving a trace behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Pitcher plants are carnivorous, feeding on insects that crawl onto the rim of their pitcher-shaped leaves. The rim is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC521129/"&gt;exquisitely slippery&lt;/a&gt;, causing prey to lose their footing and fall into a pool of digestive enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Researchers discovered that when rain and dew collect on the plant, microscopic bumps and ridges pull the water into a film that sticks to the legs of insects. The bugs struggle for traction and end up swimming — and falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In 2011, Joanna Aizenberg, an engineer at Harvard, and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10447"&gt;created materials&lt;/a&gt; with pitcher-plant patterns on their surface, and these turned out to be slippery as well. A company co-founded by Dr. Aizenberg sells &lt;a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/slips-slippery-liquid-infused-porous-surfaces/"&gt;coatings&lt;/a&gt; that keep sticky fluids from clogging pipes and paints that repel barnacles from ship hulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The mantis shrimp has a pair of odd limbs called dactyl clubs that look a bit like boxing gloves. It uses the clubs to deliver staggering punches with a force equal to that of a .22 caliber bullet — enough to crack open shells. Scientists have long wondered why those impacts don’t crack the dactyl club itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Through evolution, the mantis shrimp gained an exoskeleton of astonishing complexity. Its dactyl clubs are composed of layers of fibers; some form herringbone patterns, while others are made of corkscrew-like bundles. These layers &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv3100"&gt;deflect the energy&lt;/a&gt; from a punch, preventing it from spreading and causing damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In May, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425191122"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the creation of an artificial version of these shock-absorbing layers. When microscopic beads of silica were fired at the material at 1,000 miles an hour, it dented but did not crack. The researchers foresee using the material to make lightweight shields for spacecraft, to protect them from tiny meteoroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Ripple bugs are about the size of a grain of rice. They float on the surface of streams by spreading out their legs across the water — but they can also move with astonishing speed, roughly 120 body lengths each second. At a human scale, that would translate to 400 miles an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The secret lies at the end of the middle pair of legs. When a ripple bug dips them into the water, surface tension causes stiff fronds at the ends to fan out in just 10 milliseconds, and the fans become oars. At the end of each stroke, when the insect lifts these oars from the water, the fans snap shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In August, Victor Ortega-Jiménez, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his team &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv2792"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that, following these principles, it had built tiny robots that walk on water, make rapid turns and brake sharply. And because the water forces the fans open and closed, the Rhagabots — after Rhagovelia, the Latin name for ripple bugs — require little energy from their onboard batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="example-contents svelte-u87v75"&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The paralyzing blasts of electricity that an electric eel delivers arise from a sleeve of tissue that wraps around the animal’s body. The tissue contains thousands of layers of cells, which are sandwiched in turn between layers of fluid. The cells pump charged atoms into the fluid, creating a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/gc/d4gc00638k"&gt;biological battery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Michael Mayer, a biophysicist at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, and his colleagues are working to mimic the electric organs in electric eels and other fish. A biologically inspired battery could offer big advantages over conventional ones. They could be safer sources of power for medical implants, for instance, because they would run on organic compounds rather than toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The team has built contact-lens-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24670"&gt;prototypes&lt;/a&gt; from soft, bendable gels. Dr. Mayer hopes one day to implant the batteries with the same proteins that electric eels use to move charged atoms around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;“Building all this so that it really does the same thing as in the fish is right now beyond our reach,” Dr. Mayer said. “I think this is far in the future, but the project has already gone much further I thought it would.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

From gut health to hydration, we asked leading dermatologists to share the foods and habits that keep their skin balanced, their energy steady, and their collagen thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For dermatologist Rashmi Shetty, MD, author and international speaker, healthy skin begins in the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/simple-rules-for-a-healthy-gut" target="_blank"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;. “Everything starts in the gut, so keeping it calm and well-fed is key,” she says. Her advice is simple: Remove what doesn’t serve you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means no unnecessary sweets, snacks, ice cream, or dairy. “If you look at my fridge, there’s no butter at all,” she reveals. Instead, it’s stocked with berries, nuts, cucumbers, and baby carrots for when she needs to munch. Her three main meals are balanced between vegetables, protein (usually fish or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/ive-been-eating-2-eggs-for-breakfast-for-2-weeks-here-are-all-the-benefits-ive-observed" target="_blank"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;), and carbs—always rice, “since I'm South Indian.” “I have rice at both meals, even breakfast,” Dr. Shetty adds. For cravings, she allows herself a spoonful of whatever she loves. “That’s usually enough to make me happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaishree Sharad, medical director of Skinfinitii Aesthetic &amp;amp; Laser Clinic, sees daily proof that what you eat shows up on your face. “Premature aging, inflammation, dullness, slow healing–it all starts from within,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharad avoids processed foods and refined carbs and relies on &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/10-vitamin-c-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C–rich fruits&lt;/a&gt; for bright, even skin. Breakfast is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chia-seed-water" target="_blank"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; with nuts in almond milk. A &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-protein-shakes" target="_blank"&gt;vegan protein shake&lt;/a&gt; mid-morning keeps collagen synthesis on track. Lunch is starch-free rice, seasonal vegetables, with lentils or sprouts. Dinner is light, usually soup or salad with berries to end the day on an antioxidant-rich note. Her kitchen staples for optimal skin health include berries, soaked almonds, chia seeds, and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/magnesium-in-spinach-2025" target="_blank"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIIMS-trained dermatologist Dr. Geetika Srivastava, founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, believes glowing skin comes from clean eating, not costly treatments. “I’ve seen patients who avoid junk, drink enough water, and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/too-much-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;cut down sugar,&lt;/a&gt; and their skin literally glows. They age more slowly and need fewer procedures,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s cut salt, sugar, refined flour, and milk from her diet. Her day starts before sunrise with chia seed water. Supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/calcium-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, and spirulina round out her morning. Pre-workout, she snacks on soaked almonds, walnuts, figs, and seeds. At tea time, she allows herself one teaspoon of sugar—her only indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vogue.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:51:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SYjgwbHF4UTM3WWdHOVN6YTlxTnpPWUhQN0RpdThPSnJtZlk5NzlJVnRQalZEdnVPM3pPLTB6LXpSa1JfeDdTam5uQ21rRS1nbzN2YVdNbTFWQ04wT2xQNHFBNlJvckhmS3F6VzB6QVcwN0Rl</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，为改善睡眠而吃的头号食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/number-1-food-eat-better-125300957.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;9 Foods That Will Help You Sleep Better&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your age or your biggest health concerns, you may fill your plate with the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a66053539/best-foods-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:best foods for heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;best foods for heart health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a67992652/foods-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:best foods for gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;best foods for gut health&lt;/a&gt;, or those that will &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a66127718/foods-for-skin-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support your skin health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;support your skin health&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482512/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, during sleep is when your body initiates muscle repair, tissue growth, protein synthesis, and hormone release, ensuring that you'll be physically ready to attack the day when you awake. So adding the best foods for sleep to your evening meal or snack can go far towards supporting these processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.newhaven.edu/faculty-staff-profiles/maggie-lyon.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie G.

Here, dietitians share the best foods to enjoy before you hit the hay, plus those that could hurt your sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods to eat for better sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Cherries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A la the viral &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sleepy-girl-mocktail" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleepy girl mocktail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleepy girl mocktail&lt;/a&gt; (and, you know, science), tart cherry juice provides “a natural source of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a69209840/best-time-to-take-melatonin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:melatonin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles,” said Coe. If you take melatonin in supplement form already, try switching to a glass of tart cherry juice and see if it helps you slip into slumber, she suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nuts and seeds like almonds, cashews, and pumpkin seeds all contain magnesium,” said Coe. Magnesium &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883514/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is thought to benefit sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;is thought to benefit sleep&lt;/a&gt; by promoting muscle relaxation and therefore improving sleep quality. Nuts and seeds also contain healthy fats, Coe added, which can keep blood sugar balanced throughout the night and prevent a wakeup call from a growling stomach. Pumpkin seeds also contain &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002332.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tryptophan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tryptophan&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid that converts to serotonin, a feel-good neurotransmitter that imbues calmness, explained &lt;a href="https://www.newhaven.edu/faculty-staff-profiles/maggie-lyon.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie G. Lyon, R.D., C.D.N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maggie G. Lyon, R.D., C.D.N&lt;/a&gt;., a clinical dietitian and adjunct faculty member at the University of New Haven. Lyon added that serotonin is also converted to melatonin at night, further promoting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re probably not surprised to see turkey on this list, as it gets blamed for Thanksgiving afternoon naps annually. It is true that the bird contains tryptophan, said Lyon, but not enough to knock you out on its own. At the very least, a plate of turkey at dinner may help you relax, plus provide tryptophan that the body can use to make sleep-promoting neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dairy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warm glass of milk may really help you sleep after all. Dairy also contains tryptophan, said Coe, which can increase serotonin levels in the brain and promote relaxation. Dairy also contains a type of protein, casein, that digests more slowly than others. “Casein protein provides a steady supply of amino acids over several hours, which can support muscle recovery and growth overnight,” she added. “This can help promote deep, consistent sleep by not allowing blood sugar levels to dip, which can impact sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Chamomile tea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chamomile contains apigenin, an antioxidant that binds to receptors in the brain, promoting sleepiness, said Coe. A 2024 review in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229924000591" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Complementary Therapies in Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that chamomile may help people fall asleep faster and wake up fewer times during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eggs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are high in tryptophan, explained Coe. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/748967/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Department of Agriculture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), one egg contains 83 milligrams (mg) of tryptophan, or about 25% of the recommended daily intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa is nutritionally similar to milk—it has tryptophan and is high in protein, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168917/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you’re dairy-free or don’t really fancy drinking milk, a grain bowl for dinner may suffice for supporting sleep, said Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Fish&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish like tuna, mackerel, and salmon are high in omega-3s, an essential fatty acid that may support the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin, aiding in sleep, Coe said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12013145/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have also linked fatty fish with improved sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like fish, dark chocolate also contains omega-3 fatty acids, Coe said. Per research in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9370573/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;when chocolate is consumed in the morning, its antioxidants are also thought to support a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a32145639/what-is-circadian-rhythm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:circadian rhythm;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other cardio-metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to avoid before bed that could hinder sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you definitely want to avoid going to bed hungry, there are a few foods that could disrupt your rest, or even keep you from falling asleep, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine and alcohol: &lt;/strong&gt;“Stimulants like caffeine can disrupt sleep patterns and make it harder to fall asleep,” said Coe. “While alcohol may make you feel sleepy initially, it can disrupt sleep in the later stages, leading to poor-quality sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicy and acidic foods: &lt;/strong&gt;“Eating heavy, rich, spicy, or acidic foods before bed can cause discomfort such as heartburn, or acid reflux, which can interfere with sleep,” said Coe. “This is especially important if you are someone who struggles with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20496948/6-weird-signs-you-have-acid-reflux/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acid reflux;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt; regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imbalanced or high-sugar meals: &lt;/strong&gt;“Consuming imbalanced meals that lack protein and healthy fats or foods and drinks high in sugar before bed can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels,” explained Coe. This could keep you from falling asleep or crashing blood sugar levels could wake you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5JRnJVY2xLUHZ0aUdJSWNBZFgtbFNMdTVaWHVuU2VEX0ZTOFRER0lXX1dYSHRyUmFsLW5TaldUeTd3aHg2cWFxY3JqNFA4c2UxZ0xDZEVqZzhpZTI5TVU5RFh2eHRaMWJKQ1FZbUtJZFNNamRzanQ4</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，肌肉恢复的头号食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/number-1-food-eat-muscle-125000866.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Experts Share the Best Foods for Muscle Recovery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Stanton j Stephens - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the first thing you do when you finish a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/a45786965/perfect-workout-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:workout;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;workout&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?

Sweet potatoes also contain copper, which can help maintain healthy muscle tissue and replenish energy levels, and vitamin C, which helps to prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168917/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quinoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quinoa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similar to sweet potatoes and whole grains, is another complex carbohydrate that can restock your glycogen stores, said Agyeman. And for those who are following a vegan or vegetarian diet and looking to increase their protein post-workout, this tiny but mighty grain is a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a34692204/plant-based-protein-sources/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:great source of plant protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;great source of plant protein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Salmon&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon is another excellent protein source that’s also packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation, said White. &lt;a href="https://lewis.gsu.edu/2022/01/06/new-study-finds-omega-3-fatty-acids-can-reduce-muscle-soreness-from-exercise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have shown that omega-3s can play a big role in reducing muscle soreness after exercise. While some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124001219" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is natural after exercise (and plays a role in the muscle-building process), it's still important to make sure you don't experience prolonged inflammation, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7031348/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; says could slow recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Chocolate milk&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk offers both high-quality protein and carbohydrates which help support muscle protein synthesis and replenish glycogen stores, said White. “&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170881/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chocolate milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chocolate milk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically offers the 3:1 carb to protein ratio that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29921963/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:benefits recovery;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;benefits recovery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after tough workouts. Milk is also nutrient-dense, providing &lt;a href="https://www.usdairy.com/getmedia/0caf28ce-c6ce-4be0-adfd-dbc208f942a3/13-nutrients-in-milk-infographic-2021.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 essential nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;13 essential nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in just one 8-ounce serving that can help our body function at its best,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason this cheese is trending on social media. Just &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/328841/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:½ cup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;½ cup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of cottage cheese packs 12 grams of protein, including leucine—a branched-chain amino acid that’s important for &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1186/1550-2783-9-54" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:repairing muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;repairing muscle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said White. “Cottage cheese also contains casein, a slow-release protein that can fuel muscle protein synthesis.” If you work out in the evening, cottage cheese is also a great pick. “Because it’s slowly absorbed, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451833/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that consuming casein before bed can support overnight muscle recovery and future performance,” said White. For a recovery treat, White suggested whipping cottage cheese with dark cocoa powder and topping with berries for the added benefit of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eggs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/748967/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eggs&lt;/a&gt; are high-quality protein that’s easily digestible and also contains choline, an essential nutrient for brain and muscle function, said White. Some eggs are also fortified with omega-3s—which can be helpful for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bananas&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bananas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bananas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are rich in carbohydrates and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/nutrition-and-fitness/sports-and-hydration-for-athletes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, two essential nutrients for muscle recovery. Bonus: This fruit is very portable, which means you can pack one in your gym bag so it’s ready to eat after your sweat-sesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Spinach&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, as well as other cruciferous vegetables, are rich in &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168462/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, to prevent excess inflammation that could hinder recovery. Spinach also contains protein and antioxidant compounds known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7697716/#:~:text=Flavonoids%20are%20phytochemical%20compounds%20present,%2Dinflammatory%2C%20and%20antiviral%20properties." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;flavonoids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are also potent anti-inflammatory compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Berries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you prefer blueberries or raspberries, all berries are rich in antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation and promote overall recovery, said Agyeman. And while blueberries contain one of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747047/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highest amounts of antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highest amounts of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; among all fruits, both blueberries and raspberries are excellent sources of carbohydrates and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41392-022-01257-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa69300370%2Ffoods-for-muscle-recovery%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sirtuins;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sirtuins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sirtuins are a type of protein involved in the regulation of cell death and longevity, metabolism, and inflammation—and therefore play a big role in muscle recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to avoid after exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a workout, it’s essential to choose your foods and drinks carefully to ensure your body recovers properly. According to our nutrition experts, here are some foods you should avoid post-workout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; should be avoided at all costs because it has a dehydrating effect on the body and hinders protein synthesis, leading to slower muscle recovery, per White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salty foods&lt;/strong&gt; can impede the recovery process and cause swelling, said White, making it challenging to get back to your workout routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugary foods&lt;/strong&gt;, if consumed after a workout, can cause energy crashes due to a sudden spike in blood sugar levels, said White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a42790639/what-are-ultra-processed-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should also be avoided after workouts, White said. They contain additives that can cause inflammation in the body, which slows down muscle recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicy foods&lt;/strong&gt; may be hard for some people to digest after a hard workout, noted Mroz-Planells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veggies alone&lt;/strong&gt; don’t contain enough of the macronutrients, such as carbohydrates and protein, helpful for recovery. While not a bad snack by any means, they just may not be enough immediately following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nutrition is certainly important for muscle recovery, White clarified that eating something is always better than eating nothing, especially after a tough workout. “Appetite, time constraints and personal preferences can vary, so identifying foods and drinks that are well-tolerated, convenient and offer carbs and protein can go a long way,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other strategies to support muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of fueling your body with food, there are many other things you can do to aid in your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a36867702/post-workout-recovery-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post-workout revival;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-workout revival&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some expert tips on what you should include in your muscle recovery routine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/a44373861/full-body-stretches/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stretching;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stretching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can aid in loosening up muscle to reduce pain, improve circulation, eliminate lactic acid, and support relaxation, said White. Static stretching is better post-workout once your muscles are warmed up, noted Mroz-Planells, as opposed to before you start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking water &lt;/strong&gt;after a workout helps to support your muscles as they recover, said Mroz-Planells. “Plain water is preferred over a sports drink unless you engage in moderate to high-intensity exercise,” she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/strong&gt; supports muscle recovery through muscle repair, growth, and getting important nutrients to your muscles all while you sleep, said Mroz-Planells. It is recommended to aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to allow your body to fully recover, so you can perform at your best, advised White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workout-clothes-gear/g44375420/best-compression-boots/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Leg air compression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leg air compression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; devices can help improve blood circulation, leading to faster muscle recovery, said White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active recovery&lt;/strong&gt; can help your body recover faster after a difficult workout by improving circulation, reducing soreness, improving mobility, and reducing stiffness, said White. “Examples are swimming, walking, jogging, yoga, and foam rolling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workout-clothes-gear/g36161873/best-massage-guns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Massage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Massage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can help by improving blood flow, loosening muscles, improving range of motion, improving sleep, and decreasing inflammation, said White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a46165202/ice-bath-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ice bath;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ice bath&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is often used to reduce muscle pain, soreness, and swelling, said White. “Ice baths are known to help flush out lactic acid to aid in reducing soreness after workouts,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:00:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBPSUpqNDFqVTRVWUgxSUo0Z1NPRFk3OUN0Rm5kd0RRRmNaTDYtZEpaN1NBN0drQm1vMzMwMFo0Z2htaGxPWktqd1I1ZU85aUx2am5ubmNWeXZEeFZnT21UUTM0emhfc1pUbmdRZHhMNXZIaVFRYWxv</guid></item><item><title>没有希格斯玻色子，质量会产生吗？ - Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-11-mass-higgs-boson.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geometry of space, where physical laws unfold, may also hold answers to some of the deepest questions in fundamental physics. The very structure of spacetime might underlie every interaction in nature.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																					&lt;p&gt;A paper &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0550321325001683" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nuclear Physics B&lt;/i&gt;, led by Richard Pincak, explores the idea that all &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fundamental+forces/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fundamental forces&lt;/a&gt; and particle properties could emerge from the geometry of hidden &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/extra+dimensions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;extra dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the universe may contain invisible dimensions folded into intricate seven-dimensional shapes known as G₂-manifolds. Traditionally, these structures have been studied as static. But Pincak and colleagues consider them as dynamic: evolving under a process called the G₂–Ricci flow, where the internal geometry changes with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/organic+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;organic systems&lt;/a&gt;, such as the twisting of DNA or the handedness of amino acids, these extra-dimensional structures can possess torsion, a kind of intrinsic twist," explains Pincak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we let them evolve in time, we find that they can settle into stable configurations called solitons. These solitons could provide a purely geometric explanation of phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field gives mass to the W and Z bosons. But the authors suggest that mass could instead arise from geometric torsion in extra dimensions, without introducing an additional Higgs field. "In our picture," Pincak says, "matter emerges from the resistance of geometry itself, not from an external field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory also links torsion to the curvature of spacetime, offering a possible explanation of the positive cosmological constant that drives cosmic expansion. The authors even speculate about a new particle, the "Torstone," that might be observable in future experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to extend Einstein's vision: if gravity is geometry, perhaps all interactions are geometry. As Pincak notes, "Nature often prefers simple solutions. Perhaps the masses of the W and Z bosons come not from the famous Higgs field, but directly from the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/geometry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; of seven-dimensional space."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The term “neurodiversity” is still &lt;a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/neurodiversity_n?tl=true"&gt;relatively new&lt;/a&gt;. Even now, there’s no firm agreement among experts about what it should include. Does it refer only to neurodevelopmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia? Or should it stretch further, to include &lt;a href="https://uk.jkp.com/products/were-all-neurodiverse"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, no one had asked neurodivergent people themselves what they thought about the language used to describe them. So, we decided to do just that. Our &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/27546330251390590"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; found a mixture of positive and negative views about words like “neurodiversity” and “neurodivergent”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurodiversity refers to the different ways in which people think and behave. Just as everyone has an ethnicity, everyone has a neurotype. &lt;a href="https://rightdecisions.scot.nhs.uk/autism-meeting-the-needs-of-autistic-people-and-people-with-other-types-of-neurodivergence/what-is-neurodiversity/"&gt;Around 15%&lt;/a&gt; of people are thought to be neurodivergent, meaning their brains function differently from what society considers “typical”. The remaining 85% are neurotypical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our survey of more than 900 neurodivergent adults across the UK, almost everyone had heard of the word “neurodiversity”. Also, 74% said they used related language, such as “neurodivergent”, to describe themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One finding stood out in particular: how often the language of neurodiversity is used incorrectly. The word “neurodiverse” refers to a group that includes both neurotypical and neurodivergent people. In other words, it’s a mix of different brain types. But it’s often used to describe individuals or groups of neurodivergent people, when the correct term would be “neurodivergent”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;‘Neurodiverse’ describes groups that include both neurodivergent and neurotypical people.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/neurodiversity-concept-multicolored-figures-brain-on-2195079195"&gt;Vitalii Vodolazskyi/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many participants, this mistake was more than a harmless slip of the tongue. Some described it as deeply irritating, while others saw it as a warning sign. When an expert or organisation got it wrong, especially one claiming to be inclusive, it could be seen as a “red flag”. Some participants thought this was a sign that they used fashionable inclusive language while failing to change exclusionary practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also felt differently about how useful the term “neurodivergent” actually is. Some described it as a “safe umbrella” – a simple, inclusive way to talk about their identity without listing multiple diagnoses. One person explained that it saved them from reeling off a “laundry list” of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others said it felt safer than naming specific conditions such as autism or ADHD, which can still &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2021.0005"&gt;carry stigma&lt;/a&gt;. Saying “I’m neurodivergent” offered a way to share something about themselves while reducing the risk of a negative reaction. It also helped people who were waiting for a diagnosis or who self-identified as neurodivergent but didn’t yet have formal recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But not everyone found the word helpful. Some said it was too broad to mean anything and didn’t communicate their day-to-day challenges or support needs. Others pointed out that many people still don’t understand what “neurodivergent” means, making it ineffective as a way to explain who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also concerns that broadening the language could unintentionally increase stigma towards specific conditions, such as ADHD, by lumping everyone together under one label. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hsc.12973"&gt;Language&lt;/a&gt; shapes how we see the world but also how the world sees us. Our research shows that while umbrella terms like neurodivergent can create community and belonging, they shouldn’t replace more specific identities such as autism or ADHD. Both have an important place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of replacing those words, we should focus on reducing prejudice and discrimination against neurodivergent people, and also on using language that reflects respect and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting it right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As language choices are deeply personal, when you are talking to a neurodivergent person, it may be appropriate to mirror their language choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, a general rule is if you’re going to use language around neurodiversity, it’s important to use it correctly. Many neurodivergent people find misuse frustrating, especially when it comes from people or organisations who claim to champion inclusion. To keep it simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Neurodiverse” describes groups that include both neurodivergent and neurotypical people - you may find it helpful to think that “neurodiverse” includes everybody in the universe. “Neurodivergent” refers to individuals or groups of people whose brains work differently, for example, autistic people or those with ADHD or dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one participant put it, getting it wrong might just make a neurodivergent person want to hit you with a dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, doctors have advised people with AFib and other heart issues to stay away from caffeine, fearing it could worsen symptoms. But a new study from UC San Francisco and the University of Adelaide has found the opposite: participants who drank one cup of caffeinated coffee a day had a 39% lower risk of developing AFib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Coffee May Help the Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Coffee increases physical activity which is known to reduce atrial fibrillation," explained Gregory M. Marcus, MD, MAS, an electrophysiologist at UCSF Health and the senior author of the study, published November 9 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;. Marcus added that "caffeine is also a diuretic, which could potentially reduce blood pressure and in turn lessen AFib risk. Several other ingredients in coffee also have anti-inflammatory properties that could have positive effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of AFib have been climbing in recent years, largely due to aging populations and increasing obesity. More than 10 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed, and experts estimate that as many as one in three people may experience the condition at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Coffee's Effect on Heart Rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether coffee helps or harms, researchers designed the DECAF study (Does Eliminating Coffee Avoid Fibrillation?), the first randomized clinical trial to test the relationship between caffeinated coffee and AFib. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 200 patients who were regular coffee drinkers and had persistent AFib or a related condition known as atrial flutter, along with a history of AFib. All were scheduled to undergo electrical cardioversion, a procedure that uses a controlled electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm. Participants were randomly assigned to either drink at least one cup of caffeinated coffee or an espresso shot each day, or to completely avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Drinkers Had Lower Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, the group that drank coffee experienced a 39% lower risk of recurring AFib episodes. In addition to coffee's potential anti-inflammatory effects, the researchers proposed that those who drank coffee may have naturally replaced less healthy drinks, such as sugary sodas, with coffee instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results were astounding," said first author Christopher X. Wong, PhD, of UCSF, the University of Adelaide, and the Royal Adelaide Hospital. "Doctors have always recommended that patients with problematic AFib minimize their coffee intake, but this trial suggests that coffee is not only safe but likely to be protective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium glycinate supplements have become a popular aid for improving sleep. However, some people online claim they've become addicted to the dietary supplement and find themselves unable to sleep well without it.

There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that people develop a physical dependence on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-magnesium-supplements-improve-health-8789288" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium isn’t addictive in the way caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or certain medications can be, said &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillsprimarydoctor.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ehsan Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internal medicine doctor, staff member at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and clinical instructor at UCLA.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Your body doesn’t develop a physical dependence on it, meaning if you stop taking it, you won’t go through withdrawal or experience real physiological cravings," Ali said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's unlikely to develop a physical addiction to magnesium supplements, Ali said a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/behavioral-addiction-5221865" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psychological or behavioral dependence&lt;/a&gt; is possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you take magnesium supplements every night and notice you sleep better when taking them, your brain may start to associate them with rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you then try to sleep without it, he said, you might feel anxious about sleeping or assume you won’t be able to sleep at all. This makes it harder to relax and, inevitably, harder to sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although it is possible to develop this type of dependence, it's more likely that you feel dependent on the supplement because you had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-deficiency-5200347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; before taking it, said &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/overviewcoph/faculty/hlgray" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Heewon L. Gray, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of South Florida.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium deficiency, also called hypomagnesemia, is relatively common among US adults, especially those with chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Symptoms of hypomagnesemia include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-insomnia-the-features-symptoms-and-causes-3014805" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep disturbances and insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, so individuals who do not consume adequate amounts of daily magnesium in their diet and take supplements to improve sleep may feel dependent when they stop taking them," Gray said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is an essential mineral with a wide range of roles in the human body. The recommended daily intake for adults is 310-420mg, depending on age and sex.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because magnesium plays a crucial role in calming the nervous system, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-does-melatonin-work-11702694" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regulating melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/supplements-to-take-with-magnesium-for-sleep-11816373" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;promoting muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt;, taking it when you're deficient can significantly improve sleep quality, Ali added. So, abruptly stopping it can negatively impact your sleep quality.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people do not regularly eat &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-magnesium-7970911" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and seafood, Gray said. But the best way to get enough essential nutrients, including magnesium, is by including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrient-dense-foods-8735811" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrient-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; in your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gray said supplements are recommended if you find it challenging to get magnesium through your diet alone. If you plan to try a magnesium supplement, consider magnesium glycinate, as it’s easily absorbed by the body and gentle on the stomach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those who already take magnesium and may be worried they can't sleep without it, Ali said it's also a good idea to examine your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sleep-hygiene-8717173" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overall sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, including your wind-down routine, caffeine timing, blue light exposure, and stress levels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While magnesium can be a helpful tool, he said it shouldn’t be the only thing holding your sleep together.&lt;br&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large randomized clinical trial, researchers found that managing patients' vitamin D levels through a "target-to-treat" approach -- where blood levels were monitored and dosages were adjusted to reach an optimal range -- cut the likelihood of a second heart attack by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were presented on Nov. 9 at the 2025 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Early Results from Intermountain Researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are very encouraging, said Heidi May, PhD, cardiovascular epidemiologist at Intermountain Health and the study's principal investigator. "We observed no adverse outcomes when giving patients higher doses of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation, and to significantly reduce the risk of another heart attack, which are exciting results," said Dr. May. "We're excited with these results but know we have further work to do to validate these findings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, the results carry global importance, as between one-half and two-thirds of people worldwide have low levels of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, most individuals received sufficient vitamin D through sunlight exposure. Today, with lifestyle changes and medical advice aimed at reducing skin cancer risk, people spend less time in the sun and must rely more on dietary supplements such as vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Observation to Precision Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D levels have long been linked to poor cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies. However, earlier clinical trials that provided standard supplementation doses failed to show measurable reductions in heart disease risk. Intermountain scientists wanted to test a different idea: rather than giving everyone the same dose, what if supplementation was adjusted to reach a specific, healthy vitamin D level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies just gave patients supplementation without regularly checking blood levels of vitamin D to determine what supplementation achieved," said Dr. May. "With more targeted treatment, when we checked exactly how supplementation was working and made adjustments, we found that patients had their risk of another heart attack cut in half."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the TARGET-D Clinical Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intermountain study, called the TARGET-D trial, ran from April 2017 to May 2023 and included 630 patients who had suffered a heart attack within a month of enrolling. Participants were followed until March 2025 to monitor cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received no vitamin D management, and the other underwent active, targeted vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the treatment group was to raise blood vitamin D levels to above 40 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). At the start, 85% of participants had vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; levels below that threshold (&amp;lt;40 ng/mL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dosing, Monitoring, and Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the patients receiving targeted therapy required an initial dose of 5,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, compared to typical supplement recommendations of 600-800 IU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D blood levels were checked annually for those maintaining healthy levels. Patients with lower levels were tested every three months and had their dosage adjusted until reaching the 40 ng/mL target. Afterward, their levels were monitored once a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked major cardiac events (MACE), including heart attacks, strokes, heart failure hospitalizations, or deaths. Out of 630 participants, 107 experienced such events. While there was no significant difference in the overall risk of MACE between the two groups, the chance of having a second heart attack was cut in half among those receiving targeted vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps for Heart and Vitamin D Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to expand their work with a larger clinical trial to confirm and build upon these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger study group will allow us to more fully evaluate whether targeted vitamin D management can reduce not only repeat heart attacks but also other forms of cardiovascular disease, said Dr. May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the "black box" warning labels on many &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hrt-for-menopause-risks-benefits-fda-black-box-warnings/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hormone therapy drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms — a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long "fear machine," and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), "an American tragedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy," Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "black box" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits," Makary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more — with some experiencing more intense effects than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What studies say now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine," Makary said, denouncing the "groupthink" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, he told CBS News, "50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those millions, he said, included his own mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy," even though she was a good candidate for it. "Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. … And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60," Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything," Makary said. "But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non-hormonal therapy treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the FDA approved a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menopause-drug-without-hormones-lynkuet-elinzanetant-approved-fda/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;new, non-hormonal option&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-approves-veozah-to-treat-hot-flashes-astellas-pharma/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;was approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it," he said. "Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide," Markary said. "And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If your dog is suddenly less active, refuses to play or seems weak, it could be due to pain, infection or metabolic disorders,” Dulake said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dog who is more tired than usual might be exhibiting subtle signs of joint pain due to osteoarthritis. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-pierce-dvm-mba-a18075b8/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7967638" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Courtney Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, a canine pain medical lead with animal health company Zoetis, recommended being on the lookout for early indicators like difficulty going up or down stairs, lagging on walks, hesitation to jump up or down and limping after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, my clients will say to me, ‘He’s doing OK, he’s just slowing down a little,’” she said. “And while I certainly don’t want my older dog acting like a puppy when it comes to things like chewing up my shoes or forgetting his manners, ‘slowing down’ is not a change I welcome or ignore. Almost 40% of dogs suffer from pain associated with [osteoarthritis] but it often goes undiagnosed until the condition is very advanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although osteoarthritis is often considered a disease of old age, Pierce emphasized that this is not accurate and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10838335/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7967638" data-affiliate="true"&gt;pointed to research&lt;/a&gt; finding that about 39% of dogs between 9 months and 4 years of age showed radiographic signs of the condition in at least one joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My own dog was diagnosed with osteoarthritis when he was just 4 years old when I noticed he didn’t want to run and play with my children like he used to,” she explained. “Thankfully, because I didn’t ignore the signs, we were able to get him started on pain relief and a weight management program right away. Now we can look forward to many more happy and active years with him!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring GI Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An occasional upset stomach in an otherwise healthy dog is usually not a cause for concern,” Myers said. “Most cases of vomiting or diarrhea from eating something unusual resolve on their own within a day or so. However, when a dog shows intermittent appetite loss, vomiting or diarrhea over time, it raises a red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if each episode seemingly resolves on its own, recurring GI issues over weeks or months can signal a bigger underlying issue, which could include pancreatitis, a food intolerance or allergy, gastrointestinal obstruction or kidney and liver disease. Bloodwork and abdominal imaging can help vets identify the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any time blood is noted, that’s not something to be ignored,” Krebs said. “If there is blood in vomit or diarrhea, the dog or cat should probably be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood could indicate an infection, poisoning or other gastrointestinal problems. Be similarly mindful of abdominal distension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially relevant for large and giant breed dogs, but abdominal distension, or an outward appearance of bloating, can be a life-threatening medical condition,” Krebs said. “When I see dogs with bloated abdomens, that’s something I would take them to the vet right away to determine if more significant interventions are required. This becomes even more significant when accompanied by vomiting and abdominal pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

It could also help the neurons in your brain to rest and maybe even help the neurotransmitters involved in complex circuits in your brain to keep you awake, focused, and active, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It could also be your brain trying to play catch-up from a bad night’s sleep, says Alex Dimitriu, M.D., a psychiatrist and sleep medicine physician, and founder of &lt;a href="https://siliconpsych.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://siliconpsych.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp;amp; Sleep Medicine." data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp;amp; Sleep Medicine.&lt;/a&gt; When you’re in a deep sleep at night, your brain’s glymphatic system “washes out” leftover byproducts from a day of activity, he explains. “When people get insufficient sleep at night, it is possible that episodes of zoning out during the day may be the brain trying to catch up on processes that were not finished during the night,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-it-mean-if-you-zone-out-a-lot" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;What does it mean if you zone out a lot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, scientists don’t know anything for sure, but there are a few theories. One is that you probably could use more sleep, Dr. Winter says. But that’s likely not the only thing going on here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Zoning out “may indicate your need more food or nutrition,” Dr. Segil says. “Sleep and nutrition are both equally important to maintain a good focus,” he adds. This could also be a way of consolidating memories, being sleepy, or feeling overwhelmed by the things surrounding you, Dr. Segil says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;On a more serious note, zoning out can also be a sign of brief seizures and complicated migraines, Dr. Winter says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-zoning-out-bad-for-you" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Is zoning out bad for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s not ideal to keep zoning out when you’re trying to tackle a complicated work issue or problem-solve. Zoning out is also concerning when you’re doing things like driving or other potentially hazardous activities, Dr. Winter points out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Segil says these little lapses in attention generally aren’t harmful. “Zoning out in isolation may be healthy and is unlikely in isolation to herald any new medical diagnosis,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But zoning out can be a sign of an underlying health condition. It can be a sign of dementia in older adults, and may signal thyroid disease when it’s paired with weight gain or loss, Dr. Segil says. “Zoning out all of a sudden with new onset thirst and increased urinary frequency cause concern for a new metabolic disorder like diabetes,” he adds. Zoning out regularly can also be a sign of ADHD, Dr. Dimitriu points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But if you zone out here and there, Dr. Segil says there’s no need to worry. In fact, you may be doing this more than you realize. “In my experience, this is often happening much more often that you are aware of,” Dr. Winter says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxObnUyNXFVR3piY2lueGwyUkVPaGM3aGN3ZlQ5TE9fRnpOMHYtWXJobS1lbzh6ZnhGemk0VTByaFJ4UGQ5LVhPZWZjLWRta2x1ZFNLcXUtR0dIOHprSDRmZGw2MWdtT3pZZTNxLXQ1aWlTMWtOWHF3S2FYdXYzVUNWV2xSMlFUQnA0ZkVlcjFrNkdCUEV5dm1FdWxPMTZxVXlSdmlXbXZWLUZBZFhG</guid></item><item><title>根据《科学》杂志的报道，这就是当你被排除在外时，大脑会发生什么- Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</title><link>https://ca.style.yahoo.com/happens-brain-zone-according-science-123000418.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New research finds you’re more likely to zone out when you’re tired. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists tracked exactly what happens in the brain during these attention lapses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The finding suggest this is a way for the brain to recharge and reset. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It can be jarring when you suddenly find yourself staring into space when you were supposed to be doing something. But zoning out happens to everybody, even though the exact reason why has been a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, new research breaks down exactly what’s happening in your brain when you zone out—and it’s fascinating.

But that’s likely not the only thing going on here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Zoning out “may indicate your need more food or nutrition,” Dr. Segil says. “Sleep and nutrition are both equally important to maintain a good focus,” he adds. This could also be a way of consolidating memories, being sleepy, or feeling overwhelmed by the things surrounding you, Dr. Segil says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On a more serious note, zoning out can also be a sign of brief seizures and complicated migraines, Dr. Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is zoning out bad for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s not ideal to keep zoning out when you’re trying to tackle a complicated work issue or problem-solve. Zoning out is also concerning when you’re doing things like driving or other potentially hazardous activities, Dr. Winter points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Dr. Segil says these little lapses in attention generally aren’t harmful. “Zoning out in isolation may be healthy and is unlikely in isolation to herald any new medical diagnosis,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But zoning out can be a sign of an underlying health condition. It can be a sign of dementia in older adults, and may signal thyroid disease when it’s paired with weight gain or loss, Dr. Segil says. “Zoning out all of a sudden with new onset thirst and increased urinary frequency cause concern for a new metabolic disorder like diabetes,” he adds. Zoning out regularly can also be a sign of ADHD, Dr. Dimitriu points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you zone out here and there, Dr. Segil says there’s no need to worry. In fact, you may be doing this more than you realize. “In my experience, this is often happening much more often that you are aware of,” Dr. Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNWXFnZTFmY2t5b2kwb2Z6Sy01MTlhVmhpa012YW5HZGxabVdVUkU1ajY2SVpGby05TmY1cXFKQzliRlljUGpLeUZOMS1WSW85ZDBqcTRjMTBOQ29wTThhLWEtNVN1WUZmSTdOVzVBSURPZlMxeVpjdmZCOTlDT3BWSHdtV1c</guid></item><item><title>专家揭示模仿Ozempic效果的无药物方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-glp-1-triggers-ozempic-alternatives</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

However, the synthetic version lasts longer in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-discovered-a-natural-alternative-to-ozempic?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists May Have Discovered a Natural Alternative to Ozempic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No natural compound tested so far can exactly replicate the effects of these long-lasting injections, but early research indicates that certain foods, and the timing of their consumption, could still be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Heliopolis University in Cairo, led by microbiologist Tohada AL-Noshokaty, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2025.101895"&gt;wants to&lt;/a&gt; "usher in a new age of GLP-1 regulation by tapping into nature's resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patient compliance and quality of life could be greatly enhanced by using natural GLP-1 modulators, which may be easier on the body," the authors suggest in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2025.101895"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxicology Reports&lt;/em&gt; published in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For populations with limited financial or other resources," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2025.101895"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;, "natural remedies may provide a more accessible and less expensive alternative to conventional medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their review, AL-Noshokaty and colleagues combed through the literature and found several examples of natural products that may have some of the same characteristics as GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is still preliminary, but the natural resources &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;scientists are investigating&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiktok-says-cinnamon-in-coffee-helps-you-burn-fat-heres-the-truth"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, wheat, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-ginger-is-good-for-your-health-according-to-science"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, fermented green tea, and a bitter plant compound called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberine"&gt;berberine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176490" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176490" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/1-s2.0-S2214750025000137-gr8-642x593.jpg" alt="Natural Foods" class="size-medium wp-image-176490" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/1-s2.0-S2214750025000137-gr8-642x593.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/1-s2.0-S2214750025000137-gr8-449x415.jpg 449w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/1-s2.0-S2214750025000137-gr8-600x554.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/1-s2.0-S2214750025000137-gr8.jpg 678w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176490" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exploring natural products that modulate GLP-1.

A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2025.08.003"&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in September 2025 found that dietary fiber supplements benefit individuals who are overweight or obese by improving their blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not yet clear how fibers achieve this, but the authors of the review suspect that they increase the release of gut hormones, like GLP-1, thereby stimulating insulin and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vigorous-workouts-may-be-the-key-to-suppressing-appetite-study-says"&gt;suppressing appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-guts-methane-making-microbes-could-secretly-turn-fiber-into-extra-calories"&gt;Your Gut's Methane-Making Microbes Could Secretly Turn Fiber Into Extra Calories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more research is needed to understand how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-kimchi-actually-promote-weight-loss-a-new-study-reveals-the-truth"&gt;different foods&lt;/a&gt; impact gut hormones, but together, these experiments suggest that there are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ricezempic-is-the-latest-tiktok-hack-for-weight-loss-but-does-it-work"&gt;natural and subtle ways&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the same mechanisms as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/volunteers-lose-up-to-25-body-weight-in-high-dose-wegovy-trials"&gt;GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves open the possibility that eating some types of natural foods at certain times of day can possibly protect against the development of type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-study-finds-semaglutide-effectively-treats-serious-liver-disease"&gt;other metabolic issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-literally-came-from-a-monster-and-its-not-alone"&gt;only in the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt; that researchers first &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-025-01127-7"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; GLP-1 intravenously in a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="176488" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, we are still teasing apart the details of this crucial physiological mechanism, now responsible for some of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/popular-anti-obesity-drug-could-have-yet-another-potential-health-benefit"&gt;most popular drugs in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review from AL-Noshokaty and colleagues was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2025.101895"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxicology Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Letting the mixture stand for 10 minutes before baking softens the oats a little and distributes the liquid so they bake up tender rather than dry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can swap in 2% or nonfat milk for the whole milk if you prefer, but the texture may be slightly less rich and creamy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serve with toasted chopped walnuts or pecans, a drizzle of maple syrup or a dollop of vanilla strained Greek-style yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;

Oats contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan, which is particularly effective at lowering cholesterol. The oats along with fiber-rich raisins will give you sustained energy as you start your day. Oats are naturally gluten-free though they can be contaminated with gluten during processing. If you're following a gluten-free routine, be sure to purchased oats that are certified gluten-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051448/different-types-of-cinnamon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is not just a tasty spice, but also contains significant health benefits. Cinnamon contains a flavonoid called cinnamaldehyde, which is a potent antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation. It can also support healthy blood sugar levels and increase insulin sensitivity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044166/are-raisins-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Raisins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are dehydrated grapes and provide a good source of fiber. The fiber found in raisins can help to support a healthy gut and also help stabilize blood sugars. You’ll even find antioxidants for heart health as well as antibacterial properties in raisins. Just be aware that since raisins are a dried fruit, they will have a higher concentration of natural sugars, so be mindful of portion sizes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
