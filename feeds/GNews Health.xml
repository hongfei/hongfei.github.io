&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some social media users have recommended the use of a diversity jar as an easy way to improve gut health through at-home cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diversity jar aims to add a wider array of plants to your diet, which can boost gut health by fostering a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better gut health can improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and support better nervous system function through the gut-brain axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with an emphasis on anything packed full of protein, there’s one health consideration that nutrition-focused individuals and content creators have been heavily tuned into over the past few years: gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The term might sound nebulous at first, but as the American Medical Association explains, gut health “refers to the well-being of the digestive system, which is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste from the body.” A crucial part of this system is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, or the collection of microorganisms that aids digestion, supports your immune system, and even influences your nervous system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering the far-reaching impacts of the gut microbiome throughout the body, it’s understandable that conscious consumers want to keep theirs balanced, diverse, and healthy. One strategy that several home cooks have suggested online for easily improving gut health is to create a diversity jar. Here’s everything you need to know about this simple nutrition tool and what experts think about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-a-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is a diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/tim-spector" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, MD — a professor of epidemiology at King’s College London, the scientific co-founder of personalized nutrition service &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-gb" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, and the person credited with popularizing the diversity jar — explains that the concept “is essentially a homemade mix of plant ingredients — think nuts, seeds, spices, dried herbs, grains, and even pulses — that you can sprinkle onto meals to boost the diversity of plants in your diet.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The name of the diversity jar gives a clear hint as to what it is. It is a jar filled with various shelf-stable ingredients stored in the kitchen to add a greater variety of plants to each meal. With just a small sprinkle of ingredients from a diversity jar, you can — ideally — incorporate several plants into a single dish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tool is meant to supplement your diet, not replace anything else, and Spector recommends “starting with a spoonful a day, and you can use that spoonful however you wish. Sprinkle it on your morning yogurt, add it to soups or salads, or stir it into a stew or curry. You can always build from there. The beauty is that how you use it is entirely up to you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-benefits-does-a-diversity-jar-provide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What benefits does a diversity jar provide? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Lisa Moskovitz, RD, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Healthy-Eating-Plan-Sustainable/dp/1507216106" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest benefit of a diversity jar is “introducing more gut-friendly fiber and antioxidants.” She also notes that many nuts and seeds — ingredients you’ll typically find in a diversity jar — “pack in plenty of other great nutrients like magnesium, iron, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The diversity part of the diversity jar is key to boosting your gut health and microbiome. Consuming a wider variety of plants introduces more microbes to your gut, resulting in a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system. (Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/apr/04/30-plants-week-gut-health" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating more plants improves gut health, and Spector has recommended aiming to include at least 30 different plants into your diet each week.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chicago.dietitian?lang=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samar Kullab&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, explains that a more diverse gut microbiome can provide benefits like “a stronger immune system (less inflammation and lower risk of allergies and autoimmune conditions), a more resilient gut that bounces back faster after antibiotics or diet changes, and even better mental well-being, since your gut and brain are so deeply connected.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suffer from chronic gut issues like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome, trying a diversity jar might be an easy way to support your digestive health. (Of course, if you have any serious medical concerns, always check with your doctor to find the best course of action.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-do-you-make-your-own-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How do you make your own diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When building a diversity jar, dry goods are your friend. This jar will sit on a counter or in the pantry, so use only shelf-stable ingredients. You don’t need to be exact about the number of ingredients, but aiming for about 10–15 different components is a good target.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector notes that it’s best to aim for variety “both in flavor and in nutritional value.” This is why you should add in more than just two or three ingredients. Kullab suggests starting “with a base of seeds or grains like flax, hemp, black sesame, pumpkin seeds, rolled oats, or even quinoa flakes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next, incorporate a few nuts — any kind will do. (If you're using larger nuts like pecans or cashews, chopping or blending them will make it easier to sprinkle the mixture on your dishes.) Dried herbs, spices like turmeric, and adaptogens such as ashwagandha or maca are just a few examples of the many optional ingredients you can include.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector advises avoiding “anything highly processed or sweetened… The key is to keep it plant-based and well-balanced, with textures and flavors that enhance your meals rather than overpower them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diversity jar is meant to be playful. You may find that some combinations of ingredients don’t taste great on every dish you add them to, while other diversity jar recipes might be so delicious you'd want to sprinkle them on every meal, even if they weren't boosting your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

It can lead to long COVID, hospitalization and even death,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID is dangerous, and particularly dangerous for folks who have immunosuppression, other chronic medical illnesses, or people who are older, and these medications can help reduce those risks,” Coles added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections, which makes testing important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with every new variant, there is this narrative that suggests that we could tell if someone has COVID based on their symptoms, and that the symptoms are significantly different or unique, but all in all, they appear to be undistinguishable from any other upper respiratory infection,” Harmony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, congestion can happen whether it’s COVID or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage everyone to test if you’re symptomatic,” added Coles.

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles. Updated COVID shots for 2025-2026 are expected to be available soon, although it’s unclear &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-shot-recommendation-changes-medical-experts-concerns_l_682e1bfde4b0c2f07d8c81cb" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="who will be eligible for these shots" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a77b1ce4b0ab862cb1a364" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="682e1bfde4b0c2f07d8c81cb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;who will be eligible for these shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

That’s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one controlled study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;one controlled study&lt;/a&gt; by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person’s blood type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes’ potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cues let them know they are going to a blood source,” Day said. “Perhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates ― genetic, other factors ― increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls “secondary cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid — the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise — is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,” Day said. “They are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you’re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won’t as much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mosquito also takes in “tactile cues” once it has landed on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body heat is a really important tactile cue,” Day said. “That comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer — when they land, they’re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.” That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If body temperature is higher, you’re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you’re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,” Piliang said. “Being pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn’t.

Sunrise and sunset are when you’ll see peak activity.” Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this tip won’t help you if you’re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are most likely to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,” Day said. “A repellent that has a good protection time ― defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite ― is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do, then more histamine is released and it gets itchier,” she said. “If you scratch it, you’re also more likely to break skin. You can get bleeding, scabs and put yourself at risk for infection and scarring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are a few simple things you can do to alleviate the itch, like putting an ice cube on it. “The sensation of cold travels on the same nerve as itch, so you cannot feel both at the same time,” Piliang said. “Even a drink with ice on it will help relieve itch immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve received several bites after a morning or evening outside, she also recommended over-the-counter anti-itch creams with a mild topical steroid like hydrocortisone. “You can apply that two to three times a day to reduce itch,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And the last thing you can do if you’re really bit up is take an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="antihistamine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;antihistamine&lt;/a&gt;,” she added. “It can counteract the reaction a bit.” While OTC types that make you drowsy — like Benadryl — are more common, you can take non-drowsy antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra for daytime relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What you put on your plate every day plays a huge role in how your skin ages. In fact, some foods we casually snack on or sip with friends are secretly speeding up fine lines, dullness, and sagging. They don’t scream “bad for your skin” the way greasy fast food might, but they’re quietly working against you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important to know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intake of added sugar is increasing these days. For example, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;report, on average, Americans consume about 17 teaspoons (roughly 68 grams) of added sugar every day. This equates to approximately 270 calories from added sugars daily—much higher than the recommended limits set by experts. Leading sources of this added sugar are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edson Brandao, a 58 year old biohacker took to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNQUsuLoHo1/?igsh=NHV3YXgxc204bG4w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;to share 7 foods that silently damages our skin and pushes it towards early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch out some everyday treats might be working against you. Sneaky skin agers like sugar, soda, and ice cream don’t just taste sweet… they can accelerate wrinkles and steal your radiance," he warns his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ice cream breaks down collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice cream may be comforting, but it’s secretly rough on your skin. All that sugar creates something called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which break down collagen and elastin—the proteins that keep your skin firm and bouncy. Without them, skin gets saggy and fine lines pop up faster. Plus, the dairy can trigger inflammation or acne for some people, leaving skin looking less clear. The combo of sugar and dairy is like a double hit to your glow, making ice cream more of a wrinkle-creator than a beauty booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cola dehydrates your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cola feels refreshing, but it’s actually dehydrating your skin. The high caffeine content acts like a diuretic, meaning it makes your body lose water faster. Dehydrated skin looks dull, tired, and more prone to fine lines. On top of that, cola is loaded with sugar, which damages collagen, speeding up wrinkles and sagging. The acidity can also weaken your teeth, taking away from your overall youthful look. Basically, every sip gives you a quick energy rush but quietly steals your skin’s bounce and brightness. Swap it out with sparkling water if you want glow instead of dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit juices have added sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though fruit juice sounds healthy, most store-bought versions are loaded with sugar—sometimes as much as soda! That sugar spikes your blood glucose, leading to glycation, which weakens collagen and elastin. Over time, skin loses firmness and elasticity, showing wrinkles sooner. To make things worse, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so you’re just getting a big sugar dump without the benefits. This sugar rush also creates inflammation, which can worsen acne or redness. While fresh juice in moderation is fine, guzzling it daily can definitely fast-track dullness, sagging, and premature skin aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Margarine reduce skin hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margarine used to be marketed as the “healthy” butter swap, but it’s actually loaded with trans fats. These fats can stiffen cell membranes and reduce skin hydration, leaving you with dry, rough-looking skin. Even worse, they may damage collagen, which is your skin’s natural scaffolding. Without strong collagen, fine lines and sagging show up faster. Some studies even connect trans fats with increased inflammation, which makes skin more vulnerable to breakouts and redness. So, while margarine might spread smoothly on toast, it’s not doing your face any favors—it’s more like spreading wrinkles over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Artificial sweeteners can cause inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners might seem like a smart sugar hack, but they can mess with your skin in sneaky ways. They confuse your body, triggering insulin responses even without actual sugar, which can lead to inflammation. That inflammation shows up on your skin as dullness, breakouts, or redness. Some studies also suggest sweeteners can mess with gut health, and since your gut is tied to your skin, that imbalance may speed up aging. While they don’t directly cause glycation like real sugar, they still mess with your skin’s natural balance, making your complexion look less smooth and youthful over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muffins weaken collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muffins might look innocent (especially the blueberry ones that scream “healthy”), but they’re really little sugar bombs. The refined flour and sugar combo spikes blood sugar, leading to glycation that weakens collagen. That means skin starts sagging earlier, with wrinkles creeping in faster. Plus, most muffins are made with unhealthy oils that add to inflammation, making skin dull and puffy. What feels like a cozy morning treat is really a hit to your skin’s glow. Eat them often enough, and your skin will show it—trading radiance for tiredness. Basically, muffins are dessert in disguise, and your face knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol dehydrates the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol might make you feel relaxed, but your skin pays the price. It’s a powerful dehydrator, which leaves your skin looking dry, flat, and more lined. Dehydrated skin shows wrinkles more easily and loses that fresh glow. Alcohol also inflames your skin, which can worsen redness, puffiness, or conditions like rosacea. Over time, it messes with vitamin A levels too—an essential nutrient for skin repair. Without enough of it, your skin struggles to renew itself, so signs of aging show up faster. A glass here and there is fine, but too much drinking leaves your face looking older, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give your skin the love it deserves by ditching these culprits and choosing nourishment that works for you—not against you.

A few weeks ago, I threw up at work with such force that I peed myself. My first thought was: the treatment pamphlets tell you to sip peppermint tea and keep a fan at your desk for nausea, but nowhere did they mention you might find yourself in the staff bathroom vomiting so hard you become incontinent. If they had, I’d have popped a spare pair of undies in my work bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was diagnosed just before Christmas last year. It was a complete shock: I was 44 and the healthiest I’d been in years. At first, I was given an excellent prognosis, and after the initial shock, I rallied like never before. I decided I was going to face this head-on, full of positive energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"australia-news","tags":[{"id":"australia-news/series/the-rural-network","type":"Series","title":"The rural network"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"australia-news/rural-australia","type":"Keyword","title":"Rural Australia"},{"id":"australia-news/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","type":"Keyword","title":"Australia news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/the-rural-network","type":"Tracking","title":"The rural network"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"australia-news/2025/aug/24/ive-been-diagnosed-with-cancer-twice-in-the-past-12-months-heres-what-the-pamphlets-dont-tell-you","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But after surgery and pathology, the language shifted. They started using the word “good” instead of “excellent&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;, and we realised this was going to be more of a fight. I gathered as much information as I could, along with every resource available, determined to be prepared. But nobody told me about the messy parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f6b42809-9208-453d-acfe-4c1fe2d9ca4b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sweaty and flustered, my breast cancer patient was experiencing hot flushes.

You don’t have to follow the advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At one of your initial appointments, you will be handed a tonne of information from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Council, and most of it is solid gold. But you don’t have to do everything that’s recommended. This is a shock, and I’m sorry it’s happened to you, and it’s OK to do this your way. I started by sharing everything publicly and was overwhelmed with wonderful support. Nine months in and I’ve retreated into myself and don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Both are OK. My oncology counsellor told me to stick to my normal schedule as much as possible and not to give cancer more power than it already has. This was fine until recently when I had to cut back hours at work. I’m not giving cancer power, however – I’m giving my body the rest it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-give-your-body-what-it-needs" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;2. Give your body what it needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Right now I need rest,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;nutritious meals when I can handle them, sunlight and movement. There’s new research that suggests &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/01/exercise-better-than-drugs-after-cancer-treatment-international-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;exercise plays a vital role &lt;/a&gt;in cancer treatment, and it’s encouraged where possible. Personally, I find it improves my mood, gets me outside and helps me feel I’m taking a proactive step towards health. Likewise, I spoke to a fellow cancer warrior who explained that she loves juicing – each day she will head to the fruit market and carefully choose her fruits and vegetables. She explained she understands that juice is probably doing nothing for her cancer, but it’s not bad for her and helps her feel proactive. I’m not into juice, but after speaking with her, I now have salad for lunch every day. My daily bowl of rainbow veggies isn’t a cure, but it is a ritual that feels as though I’m telling cancer to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-your-body-will-change-in-unexpected-ways" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;3. Your body will change in unexpected ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You might pee yourself when you spew – look, it happens. Chemotherapy in particular will mess with your digestive system and you will immediately map out the toilets of any public space you are in. You might lose your hair – everywhere. Losing your nasal hair means your nose will run constantly. Losing your pubic hair makes you fart really loudly. Steroids make you pack on weight; other medications will strip it off frighteningly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-cancer-hurts-and-some-of-that-pain-is-financial" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;4. Cancer hurts, and some of that pain is financial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have stopped working full-time and we are so very broke right now. My diagnosis coincided with the cost-of-living crisis, so we’ve never needed a second income more. And cancer is expensive. It’s not as bulk billed as you would expect – the fine needle biopsy used to diagnose my cancer cost $380 after the Medicare rebate. The medical costs add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-you-will-become-your-own-best-advocate" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;5. You will become your own best advocate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sure, you should find a knowledgable medical team who has your best interests at heart, but you know your body best. If something doesn’t feel right, keep pushing until it’s paid attention to. It’s OK to demand that scan, try a different medication and to discuss treatment options. You are not difficult. You deserve solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6-you-will-lose-friends-and-gain-unexpected-ones" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;6. You will lose friends and gain unexpected ones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s this idea that challenging times “show us who our real friends are” but that’s not the case at all. Cancer is a lot, and not everyone can take this journey with you. It doesn’t make them bad people, it’s just that life is heavy for everyone and they don’t currently have space for you. But the people who stay with you will hold you up in ways you never knew you’d need, and you’ll make new friends too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7-cancer-is-a-rollercoaster" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;7. Cancer is a rollercoaster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lots of metaphors work, but this one is the best. The sudden jolting start, the highs, the lows, the speed increase and decrease and the twist you didn’t see coming. All of this is geared to get you to the exit: remission or NED – no evidence of disease. But here’s what you didn’t know: if you’re lucky you can get off the rollercoaster, but you can’t ever leave the amusement park. Every three, six, 12 months you have your scans and blood tests and see if you’re being dragged back on for another spin. I was thrown back on this year after a scan revealed new tumours, this time in my lung. I have lost the positivity that powered me through the first round. I’m not sharing as much because there’s nothing to say. It isn’t fair the first time, but the second time hits you where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="98544d55-ff73-41f3-8bff-0706ba12368e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘It’s some sort of cosmic joke’: Tracy Sorensen wrote a book about surviving cancer.

You aren’t alone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is so much help available. My family and friends, once they knew what was going on, cooked meals, grocery shopped, took care of our youngest and supported our eldest. I live in regional New South Wales and the charity &lt;a href="https://canassist.org.au/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Can Assist&lt;/a&gt; has been a lifeline. They pay for all of my cancer medications, including my radiation meds, and will cover transport and accommodation costs when I have to travel to Sydney for treatment. Your local hospital should be able to point you in the direction of a social worker who will find all of these helpful options for you. There’s probably a support group near you – make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9-you-dont-have-to-stay-positive" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;9. You don’t have to stay positive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You don’t have to be brave. You don’t have to be the best cancer patient and be liked and be an example to others. It’s OK to cry. Just make sure you reach out for help if it feels as if you are drowning in your tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="10-you-wont-be-the-same" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;10. You won’t be the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You will experience a loss of autonomy like never before. One moment my husband and I were discussing trying for a third baby, and the next I’m signing forms promising to not get pregnant for at least 12 months post radiation. But I’m stronger and surer of myself now, and I understand the fragility of life. I take fewer things for granted and prioritise my family over my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The pamphlets can’t tell you all this. But those of us who’ve been on the ride can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And if you’ve just found yourself holding that ticket – pack the spare undies. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

What you eat and drink shapes that microbial community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy sits in the middle of the conversation because it provides nutrients and, sometimes, live cultures, yet researchers don’t always agree on its effects. A careful study that sampled the colon lining directly adds useful clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet studies often rely on stool samples. That’s helpful, but it doesn’t always reflect the bacteria that stick to the gut wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project looked at those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;wall-attached microbes&lt;/a&gt;, which sit directly against our tissues. The goal was straightforward: see whether everyday dairy habits show up in that community of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome"&gt;Understanding the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your gut microbiome as a bustling neighborhood of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-fingerprints/"&gt;trillions of microbes&lt;/a&gt; – mostly bacteria, plus some fungi and viruses – that live mainly in your large intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help break down parts of food you can’t digest on your own, especially fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that feed your colon cells and help keep inflammation in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes also train your immune system, make certain vitamins, and interact with your nervous system through chemical signals. That’s where we get the term “gut feeling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s microbiome is a little different, shaped by birth, diet, environment, sleep, stress, and medicines like antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversity tends to be a good sign: a wider variety of species usually means a more stable, resilient community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no single “perfect” microbiome, but you can nudge yours in a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-find-link-between-obesity-anxiety-and-gut-microbiome-changes/"&gt;healthy direction&lt;/a&gt; with balanced meals, regular movement, enough sleep, and cautious antibiotic use when medically needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-how-dairy-shapes-gut-bacteria"&gt;Learning how dairy shapes gut bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults undergoing routine colonoscopies at a veterans’ hospital in Houston participated. Their colons appeared normal, and none had &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-helps-fight-cancer-by-changing-gut-microbes/"&gt;major conditions&lt;/a&gt; that could confound the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the procedure, doctors collected pinhead-sized biopsies from the colon lining for lab analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the team analyzed 97 biopsies from 34 people. Beforehand, participants completed a food questionnaire that covered the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;milk, cheese, yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, and total dairy intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the group used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify which bacteria were present and in what amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two basic yardsticks apply. “Alpha diversity” refers to how many kinds of bacteria are in a single sample. “Beta diversity” compares how different two people’s communities are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis adjusted for age, body size, smoking, alcohol use, health conditions, overall diet quality, and which part of the colon the sample came from. That helps separate signals that are likely true associations from those created by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-scientists-learned"&gt;What the scientists learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drank more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/extreme-heat-makes-dairy-cows-produce-less-milk/"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; – and those who consumed more total dairy – tended to have higher alpha diversity in the bacteria attached to the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta diversity also differed between higher and lower consumers of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt, indicating that intake patterns were associated with broader shifts in community structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two familiar bacteria stood out. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/faecalibacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt; is often considered beneficial because it makes butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that fuels colon cells and can calm inflammation. People who consumed more total dairy and more milk had more Faecalibacterium on the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00631-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, frequently linked to a strong gut barrier and better metabolic markers, also appeared at higher levels with milk intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-products-and-bacteria"&gt;Dairy products and bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team accounted for dietary lactose, the milk-microbe links weakened. That points to lactose as a possible &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/boost-your-gut-health-top-five-prebiotic-rich-foods-revealed/"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; – food for specific bacteria – that may help certain microbes grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fits a simple nutrition fact: milk contains lactose, while many hard cheeses have very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese didn’t follow milk’s pattern. Higher cheese intake was associated with lower amounts of certain bacteria in adjusted models, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2176045/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/a&gt; and Subdoligranulum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t treat Bacteroides as purely good or bad; it depends on the species and context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt; can produce butyrate, which is usually beneficial, so seeing lower levels with higher cheese intake raises questions about which cheese components might shift the balance. Turning milk into cheese changes nutrients in ways that could matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt intake here was very low on average – approximately a few sips per day – so the study couldn’t draw firm conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t see clear links between yogurt and diversity, and classic yogurt cultures like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/worlds-oldest-cheese-discovered-alongside-ancient-mummies/"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-gut-health-shapes-the-brain-development-of-her-baby/"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; appeared at very low levels on the colon lining in these samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-lining-yields-clues"&gt;Colon lining yields clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most data we see come from stool samples, which reflect what exits the body. The mucosa – the gut’s surface – can look different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the wall-attached community gives a closer view of the microbes that interact with the gut barrier and immune cells. It reflects the mucosal surface rather than only what is present in stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-bacteria-dairy-and-health"&gt;Gut bacteria, dairy, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tolerate dairy and already drink milk, your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/move-over-microbiome-its-time-for-the-human-guts-virome-to-shine/"&gt;gut’s surface community&lt;/a&gt; may be more diverse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cheese is your main dairy, the effects likely depend on the type of cheese, your overall diet – especially fiber – and your individual microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t tolerate lactose well, prebiotic fibers from beans, oats, bananas, onions, and asparagus can nourish beneficial bacteria by another route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different dairy foods appear to influence the gut’s wall-attached community in distinct ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger, longer studies in more diverse groups will help test which dairy components do what, and for whom. For now, what goes in your glass and on your plate shows up in your gut in measurable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPWTdQUWQ0SE9BNV80eE5FMWxxMkd0dFZKRU1fRkJPQk1jUzY5RkFoOFFKMVdnVmdxbkU0T0FqUEx1cmRjNWxvcUFyYmFHeTNLUjhrTW1HckJIeW9IQkpKN2RYSDBpVlNSazZwNTVFa3FCZ1RTaDN4MTFyZmhaYVBaYTl0VGRUYXJHd3c0dWV2VGROSXQwMnhzYkJodXJiNTUtSzBzdlVnZU8</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，最好的肠道健康晚餐- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-dinner-for-gut-health-dietitian-approved-11796229</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut-healthy dinner should combine probiotics, prebiotic fiber and anti-inflammatory foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roasted salmon with chickpeas, kale and a whole grain provides protein, omega-3s and gut-supporting fiber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi or miso boosts probiotics that help balance the gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we talk about “gut health,” we’re really talking about the gut microbiome—the trillions of microorganisms in your digestive tract. This community doesn’t just affect digestion, it also influences your metabolism, immune system, hormones and even brain function. “Recent research shows that a balanced microbiome supports nutrient absorption, hormone and neurotransmitter production and more,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists/tami-best" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tami Best, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in nutrition and gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what does that mean for dinner? We recommend our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262763/roasted-salmon-with-smoky-chickpeas-greens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Salmon with Smoky Chickpeas &amp;amp; Greens&lt;/a&gt; as one of the best meals you can make for gut health. Each serving provides nearly one-quarter of the Daily Value for fiber (6 grams) from plant foods that feed beneficial gut bacteria. Salmon adds high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids to help lower inflammation. If you want to round it out with a grain, choose &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8038825/high-fiber-whole-grain-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quinoa, wild rice or barley&lt;/a&gt; for added prebiotics—or start with white rice if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;easing into more fiber&lt;/a&gt; to avoid bloating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-dish-is-so-great-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why This Dish Is So Great for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prebiotic Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dianamesa.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diana Mesa, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt; says legumes are one of her favorite prebiotic sources—and this recipe puts chickpeas to work. They’re tossed with oil, paprika and salt, then roasted until crispy to pair with salmon and kale. Have extras? &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259418/crunchy-roasted-chickpeas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; make a tasty snack on their own or a crunchy salad topping the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This dish also incorporates kale, which also helps to support your gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The recipe calls for cooking it on the stovetop for a warm side, but you can serve it chilled if you’d prefer something more refreshing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Offer Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe includes a creamy green dressing to top the salmon and greens. One source of the dressing’s creaminess is buttermilk, an ingredient that sometimes (but not always) contains probiotics. (Check the label for live and active cultures.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sure if your buttermilk contains probiotics, it’s also easy to add probiotics by using plain yogurt instead of buttermilk or mayonnaise in the recipe. Or, you can swap the dressing and make this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7917202/creamy-yogurt-dill-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Yogurt-Dill Sauce&lt;/a&gt; instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anti-Inflammatory Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe incorporates a few anti-inflammatory ingredients that Best recommends, including green leafy veggies, fatty fish and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8003928/regular-vs-extra-virgin-olive-oil-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt;. “Anti-inflammatory foods help keep intestinal cells healthy,” says Best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the chickpeas are seasoned with paprika, a spice that may have anti-inflammatory benefits due to its capsaicin content. Capsaicin is responsible for the spicy flavor of foods like paprika and chile peppers. Research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;capsaicin may help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stimulate mucin production in the colon, which supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-gut-health-friendly-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Gut-Health-Friendly Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A gut-healthy dinner includes more than just one superstar ingredient—it’s about combining the right foods and habits. Here are the key things to keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotic-Rich Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are good-for-you live bacteria that help populate your gut for a healthy microbiome. We still need more research to learn if or when &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt; are beneficial, so getting probiotics from food sources is especially important.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find probiotics in foods such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, miso, kefir&lt;/a&gt; and some brands of cottage cheese. Yogurt is another great probiotic-rich food that can be incorporated into dinner—Mesa recommends that it can be used as a base for a dressing or marinade or dolloped onto a bowl of soup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prebiotic Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is great for gut health—especially if it’s a specific type called prebiotic fiber, which acts as food for the healthy bacteria in your gut, allowing them to thrive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The bacteria in your gut ferment prebiotic fiber, releasing byproducts such as gases and short-chain fatty acids,” says Mesa. “Short-chain fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, which are not only beneficial to gut health but to overall health, too,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;The prebiotic foods&lt;/a&gt; that Best recommends include whole grains, peas, legumes, artichokes, garlic, honey, asparagus, banana, dandelion greens and onions. Mesa says she loves incorporating potatoes, legumes or plantains in her dinners for prebiotic fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Plant Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a gut-friendly dinner, make sure you’re packing in the plants. One study ifound that people who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; rich in plant foods had significantly more diverse gut microbiomes than those who ate a typical Western diet low in fiber and high in added sugars and animal products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The researchers believe antioxidants—found in abundance in plant foods—may have something to do with this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Low-Stress Environment &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health is about more than just the nutrients you eat. It’s also about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you eat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; can promote nervous system regulation and help your body enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921263/can-stress-cause-diarrhea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;“rest and digest” mode&lt;/a&gt; for optimal digestion. In fact, research on mindfulness-based stress reduction has shown robust improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms among people with IBS, with benefits linked to the ability to stay present and eat with awareness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try eating dinner in a low-stress environment. Set aside enough time so you’re not rushed, and aim to eat regularly during the day so you don’t arrive at dinner overly hungry. This gives you the chance to chew your food well. “Digestion begins in the mouth, and in the hustle and bustle of daily life, you might find yourself eating quickly,” says Mesa. Slowing down and chewing thoroughly can support digestion and make meals more enjoyable, she adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a healthy gut, it’s important to eat prebiotics, probiotics and anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish and leafy greens.

To see how Banting's diet holds up in the 21st century, fitness YouTuber William Tennyson (pictured) decided to give it a go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, ideally, you'd want your immune system to just be absolutely 100 percent. I don't think this [drink] would do it. I think this is just an excuse to have sugar and alcohol in the morning. Dare I say an energy drink is healthier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving on to breakfast, Tennyson rustles up a feast in line with what Banting would have eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his diet book, Banting wrote: 'For breakfast, I take four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys, broiled fish, bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork; a large cup of tea (without milk or sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce of dry toast.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This restriction of pork stemmed from a belief at the time that it contained starch and saccharine matter, which Banting and his medical adviser, William Harvey, believed contributed to the creation of fat and hindered weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that it is easy to understand why Banting lost weight with such a 'sad looking' breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the mutton (aged lamb) tastes 'very earthy' and 'like I'm licking a barn door.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he noted he was happy to see some protein on his plate to kick off the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies consistently show that increasing your protein intake is one of the most effective strategies for promoting satiety and helping with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, some carbohydrates such as pastries and pasta, don't keep you full because they are refined or processed, causing rapid blood sugar spikes and crashes that lead to hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 19th century, what is now called lunch was generally known as dinner, and it was the largest meal of the day, served in the early afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his food diary, Banting said for 'dinner' he enjoyed: 'Five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira - champagne, port and beer forbidden.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Banting excluded salmon as it is considered one of the fattiest fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mirroring this medley, Tennyson made a meal with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dessert, he interpreted 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most modern-day diets generally recommend limiting or avoiding alcohol, Tennyson was surprised to see that alcohol is a running theme with the Banting diet, with up to seven glasses permitted per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The calorie count of wine varies significantly based on its alcohol content and sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a standard five ounce (150ml) glass of dry table wine typically ranges from 120 to 130 calories, while dessert wines and fortified wines like sherry can have a much higher calorie density. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dry sherries are low in sugar and calories, while sweet or cream sherries are much higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As he sipped the sherry, Tennyson mused: 'Dude has the priorities of a seasoned pirate. Or you want to know what? Maybe this was safer to drink than water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For breakfast, Tennyson dined on mutton, a biscuit and tea without milk and sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Banting, who was an funeral director living in London during the mid-19th century, claimed to have lost 52 pounds by adhering to a low-carb diet. Astounded by the results, he printed his weight loss secrets in a booklet titled Letter On Corpulence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his midday meal, Tennyson went for a 'gentle walk' before returning home for  'tea' which comprised 'two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk (a light, dry biscuit) or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Banting diet was mainly concerned with food intake, with meals every three to four hours, and there is little focus on working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Considering he ate less calories than he usually would, Tennyson said he was surprised how satisfied felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For his final meal of the day, 'supper,'  Tennyson opts for chicken in line with Banting's meal plan ('three or four ounces of meat or fish') and this is paired with a 'glass or two' of sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The YouTuber said he likes the light protein before bed but the alcohol leaves him feeling a little light headed, as it did so earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before bed, Banting recommended a 'tumbler of grog (gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar) or a glass or two of claret or sherry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson opted to have a glass of gin, which made him feel even more woozy. He said: '[Banting] may have lost waist size, but man, that liver. So he says that this [alcohol] attributes to the perfect night's sleep. I mean, yeah, probably because I'm going to be unconscious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol creates an illusion of restful sleep by initially acting as a sedative, but it disrupts the natural sleep cycle, leading to less REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and more light sleep, causing fragmented rest and frequent awakenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day and alcohol aside, the YouTuber said he can see why the Banting diet can be effective when it comes to shedding weight as it is very low carb and it is less than the recommended calorie intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Other than the alcohol, I will say it's actually kind of debatable that this diet is better than a lot of current diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[This is] because there's just a lot of single ingredient foods. No additives, no chemicals, just the food for what it is, which we need more of in today's day and age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tennyson makes a lunch with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. For dessert, he interprets 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, while there's a lot of things that we should stay away from today, there's a lot of things that we should probably bring back and adopt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson used a food tracking app while on the Banting diet and in one day, it came out to &lt;span&gt;1,714 calories, 115g of protein, 31g of fat, &lt;/span&gt;and 68g of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, the recommended calorie intake per day is 2,500 calories and when it comes to macronutrients, the USDA recommends consuming 10 percent to 35 percent of calories from protein, 45 percent to 65 percent from carbohydrates, and 20 percent to 35 percent from fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that the Banting diet is so low in carbs, 'most people are going to lose &lt;span&gt;some weight.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York-based nutritionist Laura Cipullo told DailyMail.com that the Banting diet is a precursor to today's keto diet, which involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-5919c3d0-7eb0-11f0-8976-bb5db4900e1d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15019255/banting-diet-weight-loss-low-carb.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;THE BANTING DIET &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For dinner, five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira—champagne, port and beer forbidden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For tea, two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For supper, three or four ounces of meat or fish, similar to dinner, with a glass or two of claret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog—(gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar)—or a glass or two of claret or sherry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says: '&lt;/span&gt;The Banting or keto diet macronutrient distribution typically ranges from approximately 55 percent to 60 percent fat, 30 percent to 35 percent protein, and five percent to 10 percent carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While you will dehydrate and lose all water related to glycogen stores immediately, you will then start to utilize fat and protein for energy. The goal is to use fat as the primary source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One should exercise when attempting a low-carb diet to preserve muscle mass and hypertrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, personal trainer and fitness expert Natalya &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://trainer-nyc.com/"&gt;Alexeyenko&lt;/a&gt; says she is not a fan of such restrictive approaches to dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because from her observations, she believes strict approaches usually bring 'only temporary results, and eventually, most people end up rebounding'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her preferred approach, she says: 'What works much better long-term is having a clear understanding of how to manage your calories, protein, fats, and carbs according to your current goals without feeling like you have to cut things out completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbs in particular, play an important role in building and maintaining muscle. With diets that cut them too low, someone might see the number on the scale go down, but in reality they’re often losing muscle instead of fat leading to that “skinny fat” look or simply not having a toned body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at the future of dieting, the personal trainer thinks there will be 'less focus on rigid plans and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone’s lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 23:18:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOSTJ3Xzg5RFQ3cElLUEJDcmVGRlVmLUpSZkU1cVE2NmtzTk9ldER4SXNGVW1mOHZ1djJBUFJtZWRfS0ZZR0w3UWlCNm5mWkdZY083aGNVQVc1cldrSms0ZEpRcVIzX3VzNk9nazcxUUxna1A2R3lNdUktRVB4SDZSbkJDLS1lc29SaGNoOFZ3RnVFWjZa0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBaanFUd1VPX3RtZFdEZ3hhSTBNaFpXTGhhX0tSRExKclkzbWtDVnhTdUxPXzRINkRUdy1YaDltSmMyVFRERldrb21Hb3UwV1ZQdXV3RjVuZTY4Rk5MWEg1QzJwUkFnQzkwTXI1dmVGWk5SREFVR1lweEdGOV9RdFdzeGdOYlFSa3NWSVVhYVVQcTBLWjh3aGR0S0E</guid></item><item><title>44个很酷的人体东西，在这个在线线程中被人们分享-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/coolest-things-human-body-does/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/human-body/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;The human body&lt;/a&gt; is truly amazing.

What's more, human bones are incredibly strong. You may have heard that they're stronger than steel, but did you know a block of bone the size of a matchbox can support up to 18,000 pounds of weight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you knew these facts; perhaps you didn't. That doesn't change the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/creepy-fact-human-body/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;our bodies can do stuff&lt;/a&gt; that is pretty darn impressive.

We're relatively tall and top-heavy and our feet aren't very big. The amount of brain processing required to keep that shape upright, let alone do something like dancing or ice skating, just seems insane to me. Your brain is doing countless little micro-adjustments constantly whenever you're standing, and yet it feels completely effortless.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mnad6q/what_is_the_coolest_thing_that_the_human_body_does/n83ll13/" target="_blank"&gt; paraworldblue &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/backview-of-stylish-man-overlooking-the-view-9910900/" target="_blank"&gt; cottonbro studio &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10081-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9188795"&gt;  &lt;p id="9188795" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Creating life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Breast milk** is also mind blowing.

Breast milk from two moms who have babies of the same age will also not have the same composition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a baby catches a cold or gets sick, the mom's body will produce milk that helps the baby heal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breast milk is the most personalized food that exists. 😁.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mnad6q/what_is_the_coolest_thing_that_the_human_body_does/n83pwxq/" target="_blank"&gt; opal_23 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10081-20/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9188783"&gt;  &lt;p id="9188783" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-tamar-willoughby-346256-951886-68a320110e0b9__700.jpg" alt="Person walking on a nature trail wearing a blue jacket, illustrating cool facts about the human body and fascination with it." title="Person walking on a nature trail wearing a blue jacket, illustrating cool facts about the human body and fascination with it."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I havent seen a single comment about the uniquely high endurance humans have compared to other animals, we survived as endurance hunters chasing animals, not with our speed, but by walking them to death by following them until they were too tired to continue walking.

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large study found that animal protein is not linked to higher mortality and may even help lower cancer-related deaths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating foods that contain animal protein is not connected to a higher chance of death and may even provide some protection against cancer-related mortality, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, are based on an analysis of data from nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAMES III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at how much animal and plant protein participants consumed and compared those patterns with their risk of dying from cancer, heart disease, or any cause. The results revealed no elevated risk of death linked to greater animal protein intake. Instead, the data pointed to a small but meaningful decrease in cancer-related deaths among people who consumed more animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of confusion around protein – how much to eat, what kind and what it means for long-term health. This study adds clarity, which is important for anyone trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions about what they eat,” explains Stuart Phillips, Professor and Chair of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University, who supervised the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ensuring Reliable Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure reliable results, the team employed advanced statistical methods, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method and multivariate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling, to estimate long-term dietary intake and minimize measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was imperative that our analysis used the most rigorous, gold standard methods to assess usual intake and mortality risk. These methods allowed us to account for fluctuations in daily protein intake and provide a more accurate picture of long-term eating habits,” says Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no associations between total protein, animal protein, or plant protein and risk of death from any cause, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;, or cancer. When both plant and animal protein were included in the analysis, the results remained consistent, suggesting that plant protein has a minimal impact on cancer mortality, while animal protein may offer a small protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader Implications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect; however, they are valuable for identifying patterns and associations in large populations. Combined with decades of clinical trial evidence, the findings support the inclusion of animal proteins as part of a healthy dietary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When both observational data like this and clinical research are considered, it’s clear both animal and plant protein foods promote health and longevity,” says lead researcher Yanni Papanikolaou, MPH, president, Nutritional Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

And that's never a great sign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I just remember her going, "I don't want you to &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/google/index.html" id="mol-e1b4c410-7d3e-11f0-8502-f924d9a911ce" class=""&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; this, but you have something called PSC".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd, a clinical social worker and professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, followed her advice for some time before finally researching the condition and coming to terms with the inevitable reality: one day she would need a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Courtney Kidd, a 38-year-old clinical social worker and professor, was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis nearly two decades ago. Now she needs a liver transplant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It was terrifying, but I didn't have a lot of choices. There's no real medication for it. There's no treatment for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And so I kind of decided, have to do things when you feel good, because I have no idea what's going to happen with this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 100 million Americans have some form of liver disease, and most don't know it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver disease, the most common type, often develops silently, causing few or no symptoms at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over time, the liver gradually becomes inflamed and eventually scarred, a condition called cirrhosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cirrhosis is irreversible, meaning the only treatment is either a partial or full liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes primary sclerosing cholangitis, but it's thought that immune reactions to toxins or infections, as well as conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, may raise the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About nine in 10 PSC patients also have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the lowest parts of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd now is one of 9,000 Americans awaiting a liver transplant. This makes it the second most sought after organ behind kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most organs come from deceased donors, more and more patients with liver disease are seeking live donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living donors provide up to 70 percent of their liver to a recipient. Unlike other transplanted organs, the liver regenerates. In fact, it only takes about three months for both the donor and recipient livers to regrow to their full size and capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver is an incredible organ,' Kidd said. 'A lot of people don't realize you can donate part of your liver and be totally fine without any change to their lifestyle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most living liver donors are close family members or friends, but everyone in Kidd's inner circle has not been a match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living donors need to be the same blood type as the recipient or type O negative, the universal donor blood type. They also need to be free of any form of liver disease, be under 50 and have a relatively healthy lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd, pictured second from the right, once traveled the world and lived abroad. Her condition has now progressed and forced her to stay stateside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd is pictured above with her family. Family and friends have been tested, but none have been a match to donate to her yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd spent nearly a decade 'fairly asymptomatic' after her diagnosis, allowing her to travel to 12 countries, including living in Scotland for three years before moving back home to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because PSC progresses slowly and is usually diagnosed via routine blood test or x-ray before symptoms like fatigue, yellow eyes, itching and abdominal pain set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, it can cause fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss and an enlarged liver and spleen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd told this website: 'The only symptom I really had was that my lab work was getting worse, the liver enzymes were getting worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally did develop minor symptoms in her late 20s, they started with what she calls 'the itch.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver normally processes and excretes bile acids, but as it failures, those acids build up in the bloodstream and skin, causing an unbearable itch.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd said: 'I knew at that point I had kind of crossed over the mark of being symptom free to symptomatic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her condition deteriorated in her 30s, forcing her to cut down on travel and be placed on the transplant list for a new partial liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A patient's need for a new liver is measured by a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which ranges from six to 40. A higher score indicates a greater risk of death within three months or a more urgent need for a liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with high MELD scores are prioritized for getting an entire liver from a deceased donor, which means patients like Kidd have to rely on living donors. Kidd's MELD score is around 10 to 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'My MELD score has, fortunately and, yet, unfortunately, remained very low, so I have no hope of a deceased donor call coming in. I will not get a call at this point saying, "Hey, we've got a liver for you. Come in for surgery."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So my only viable option without getting really sick is a living donor.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in later stages, conditions like PSC can progress rapidly while Kidd waits for a donor, leaving her with less time to get a new liver than her MELD score may suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd said if she gets a transplant, she will take her mother (pictured here with Kidd) to Ireland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Kidd awaits a transplant, her treatment plan 'is to try to stay out of the hospital as much as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I fail pretty drastically at that,' she added. 'I've landed myself there twice this summer alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PSC can put pressure on the portal vein, a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. This causes blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach to enlarge and become prone to rupture and bleeding, which requires urgent attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease has also weakened Kidd's immune system, landing her in the hospital with infections several times a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, she has maintained her private therapy practice, though she has had to cope with less freedom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I try to live as normally as possible. I had to stop a lot of the things I love. I used to be a huge traveler. I would kind of just drop the hat and go to Europe for a weekend and see my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would fly back and forth, I would go see friends, I would travel. I would do a lot of things, even making plans, seeing shows. It's always with the kind of asterisk now of if I can. So I'm homebound a lot more, more New York-based.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd's donor would need to have either type A or O blood and be able to locate to the Long Island, New York, area for surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing prior to surgery can be done remotely, and Kidd's insurance covers all costs for the donor's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who are interested in getting tested can visit &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://courtneysliver.com/"&gt;Kidd's website&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If Kidd gets the call that there's a donor ready for her, she's most looking forward to hopping on a plane again and jetsetting around Europe. For her first trip with a new liver, she plans to take her mother to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also hopes to start a national liver donation registry to help other patients get matched with a donor more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd told this website: 'I'd really like to get back to my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowering systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg may prevent more cardiovascular problems than higher treatment goals, according to new research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the stricter target carried a higher risk of side effects and greater medical costs, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. The study also showed that the lower goal was cost-effective, even when accounting for typical errors in readings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggressive Blood Pressure Control Shows Promise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from Mass General Brigham reports that the potential health benefits of stricter blood pressure management appear to outweigh the risks of overtreatment. Their findings come from a simulation study recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To carry out the analysis, researchers drew on information from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and other scientific sources. They modeled long-term health outcomes, such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, for patients treated to three different systolic blood pressure goals: &amp;lt;120 mm Hg, &amp;lt;130 mm Hg, and &amp;lt;140 mm Hg. Because blood pressure medications can cause side effects, the study also examined the likelihood of serious complications linked to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model further incorporated the types of reading errors that commonly occur during everyday clinical measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits and Risks of Lower Targets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for these errors, the results showed that aiming for a systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg prevented more cardiovascular events than the 130 mm Hg goal. However, this more aggressive target also came with added risks, including falls, kidney injury, low blood pressure (hypotension), and a slow heart rate (bradycardia). In addition, the intensive target increased overall healthcare costs because of greater medication use and more frequent medical visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the three targets were compared for cost-effectiveness under typical measurement conditions, the &amp;lt;120 mm Hg goal was still favorable. The researchers estimated it provided good value, with an associated cost of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert Perspective on Intensive Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study should give patients at high cardiovascular risk and their clinicians more confidence in pursuing an intensive blood pressure goal,” said lead author Karen Smith, PhD, an investigator at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. “Our findings suggest the intensive &amp;lt;120 mm Hg target prevents more cardiovascular events and provides good value, and this holds true even when measurements aren’t perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith also cautioned, “Our results examine the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment at the population level. However, given the additional risk of adverse events related to antihypertensives, intensive treatment will not be optimal for all patients. Patients and clinicians should work together to determine the appropriate medication intensity based on patient preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people carry a rare mutation that makes them resistant to viruses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now scientists have copied that effect with an experimental mRNA therapy that stopped both flu and COVID in animal trials — raising hopes for a universal antiviral.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rare Mutation Unlocks Viral Immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For only a few dozen people worldwide, living with a rare immune disorder comes with an unexpected advantage: the ability to resist every &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;virus&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that can replicate only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Structurally, viruses consist of genetic material—either DNA or RNA—enclosed in a protective protein coat called a capsid, and sometimes a lipid envelope. They are uniquely distinguished by their simple, acellular organization and mode of reproduction, which involves hijacking the host cell&amp;amp;#039;s machinery to produce new virus particles. This process often results in disease in the host organism. Viruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases, including the common cold, influenza, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. Despite their pathogenic nature, viruses also play roles in ecological and evolutionary processes, influencing gene transfer and genetic diversity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt; that comes their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago, Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic first uncovered this remarkable protection shortly after identifying the genetic mutation behind the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the disorder appeared to simply make people more susceptible to certain bacterial infections. But as more cases were studied, a surprising benefit became clear. Bogunovic, now a professor of pediatric immunology at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is an Ivy League institution based in New York City, recognized for its excellence in medicine, law, and scientific research.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt;’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, found that everyone with the mutation, which leads to a shortage of an immune regulator known as ISG15, experiences mild but persistent whole-body inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hidden Antiviral Clues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The type of inflammation they had was antiviral, and that’s when it dawned on me that these individuals could be hiding something,” Bogunovic recalls. When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals’ immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses—flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any virus,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after years of research, he is developing a potential therapy that could replicate this unusual form of protection and serve as a powerful safeguard in the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough Experiment Shows Promise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest study, published on August 13 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Bogunovic and his team report that an experimental therapy they’ve developed temporarily gives recipients (hamsters and mice, so far) the same antiviral superpower as people with ISG15 deficiency. When administered prophylactically into the animals’ lungs via a nasal drip, the therapy prevented viral replication of influenza and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and has infected hundreds of millions worldwide. The virus has undergone multiple mutations, resulting in variants with differing transmission and immune escape characteristics.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/span&gt; viruses and lessened disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cell culture, “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Therapy Works&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s therapy is designed to mimic what happens in people with ISG15 deficiency, but only for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of turning off ISG15 directly—which leads to the production of more than 60 proteins—Bogunovic’s therapeutic turns on the production of 10 proteins that are primarily responsible for the broad antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current design resembles COVID mRNA vaccines but with a twist: Ten mRNAs encoding the 10 proteins are packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticles are absorbed by the recipient’s cells, the cells generate the ten host proteins to produce the antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only generate a small amount of these ten proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals,” Bogunovic says. “But that inflammation is enough to prevent antiviral diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next-Gen Pandemic Preparedness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s team views their technology as a weapon against the next pandemic, providing protection for first responders, individuals in nursing homes, and family members of infected individuals, regardless of the responsible virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe the technology will work even if we don’t know the identity of the virus,” Bogunovic says. Importantly, the antiviral protection provided by the technology will not prevent people from developing their own immunological memory to the virus for longer-term protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the technology’s drug delivery and absorption properties still need optimization. When delivered to animals via nanoparticles, the 10 proteins were produced in the lungs, “but probably not at high enough levels that makes us comfortable going into people immediately,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fine-Tuning for Human Use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field.” The researchers also need to determine how long the therapy’s antiviral protection will last, currently estimated at three to four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reinforce the power of research driven by curiosity without preconceived notions,” Bogunovic says. “We were not looking for an antiviral when we began studying our rare patients, but the studies have inspired the potential development of a universal antiviral for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cow’s Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Koszyk, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that. A 1-cup serving of skim milk delivers 8 grams of protein for just 90 calories. Whether you enjoy it on its own for a quick and nutrient-rich snack, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein shake with fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein shake with fruit&lt;/a&gt; for an on-the-go meal, or in a bowl of cereal, there’s no shame in adding dairy milk into your meal plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fortified Soy Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein. The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories. Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Naturally Sweetened Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled. But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:your coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;100% Pomegranate Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pomegranate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; consumption has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and other markers of cardiovascular health. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, good-for-you antioxidant compounds that help rid your body of free radicals and help decrease inflammation. For a nice twist on iced tea, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249903/hibiscus-pomegranate-iced-tea/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low-Calorie, Lower-Sugar Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest first &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290448/is-drinking-soda-bad-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to diet soda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to diet soda&lt;/a&gt; if you typically drink regular, then, over time, phase soda out completely (other than on occasion). Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Can Drinks Help with Weight Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term. Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Know If a Drink Is Good for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-drinks-you-shouldnt-avoid-for-weight-loss-11796212" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 20:09:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1aMUhIeEFwUzZpandxZjMxWlFicGZWZmN0TFd2b2tKdExXZ1ZIZXpabFY3TVdHaDFLTDFINFB4QnNhZjlaRktxUFJnYWJpR2JQaE1mVy1fT2VnendkM2ZFaGJJNE1LNGxwSkFWeE1KNA</guid></item><item><title>在“僵尸”兔子和松鼠的照片病毒式传播之后，鹿疣图像现在成为趋势- WPFO</title><link>https://fox23maine.com/news/offbeat/deer-wart-images-now-trending-after-photos-of-zombie-rabbits-and-squirrels-went-viral-animals-wildlife-experts-rabbits-squirrels-diseases-growths-fibroma-caseous-lymphadenitis-papillomas-virus-hemorrhagic-disease-bluetongue-virus-hunters-meat-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;***WARNING: This story contains graphic content. Viewer discretion is advised.***&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of "Frankenstein" or "zombie" rabbits and squirrels with unusual growths recently started circulating on social media -- and now photos of deer with warts seem to be joining the bizarre trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images may appear alarming, but wildlife experts said the lumps or abscesses on deer and other wildlife are not uncommon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; said two main causes of the growths include &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Caseous Lymphadenitis &lt;/a&gt;(CL) and &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#papillomas-warts" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#papillomas-warts" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Papillomas&lt;/a&gt;, also known as warts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it routinely monitors wildlife for disease, such as sample testing from potentially sick animals reported by hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While concern about CL or papillomas passing to humans through contact with an affected animal is small, as with all potential wildlife diseases, hunters should use standard game meat handling hygiene," the agency noted online. "Use protective gloves, avoid cutting into lumps and abscesses but cut away and discard them, clean equipment, and thoroughly cook meat."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas" target="_blank" title="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The Cornell University Wildlife Health Lab&lt;/a&gt; described the growths as fibromas, or fleshy, wart-like nodules, noting that they tend to vary in texture, size, and color. They can occur on any part of an animal's body, but are typically found their heads and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fibromas can affect an animal’s vision, feeding, breathing, and movement, depending on their size and location," Cornell University Wildlife Health Lab wrote on its website." In addition, abrasions on fibromas can lead to secondary bacterial infections. The growths are generally self-limiting and regress on their own as infected animals mount an immune response. However, in immunocompromised animals, fibromas may progress and invade internal organs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibroma viruses are typically transmitted by insect vectors, such as fleas and mosquitoes, and direct contact with injured skin, according to experts. There is no treatment for fibromas in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White-tailed deer are susceptible to several diseases and are hosts to numerous parasites, the &lt;a href="https://www.msudeer.msstate.edu/diseases-and-parasites.php" target="_blank" title="https://www.msudeer.msstate.edu/diseases-and-parasites.php" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mississippi State University Deer Ecology and Management Lab&lt;/a&gt;. It said "a major exception" is hemorrhagic disease, which is caused by the epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or bluetongue virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states, including Maine, Missouri, and Idaho have reported recent cases of EHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EHD is a virus that spreads among white-tailed deer, causing them to appear weak or disoriented. Infected animals are often found near water as they seek relief from fever. There is currently no cure for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Most wildlife disease researchers believe that [the disease] has negatively impacted deer populations for most of the 20th century," according to &lt;a href="https://www.mdwfp.com/wildlife-hunting/wildlife-species-program/deer-program/deer-diseases-abnormalities" target="_blank" title="https://www.mdwfp.com/wildlife-hunting/wildlife-species-program/deer-program/deer-diseases-abnormalities" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;We're learning more and more about how parts of our bodies are linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-remarkable-connection-discovered-between-our-heart-and-brain"&gt;and working together&lt;/a&gt; – and now a new study reveals connections between gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, from scientists in China and the US, suggests that being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cognitive-shuffling-really-could-help-insomniacs-get-to-sleep"&gt;unable to sleep at night&lt;/a&gt; could be at least partly down to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;mix of microbes&lt;/a&gt; in our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the relationship appears to go both ways: poor sleep can disrupt the gut's microbial balance, creating a feedback loop that could make insomnia harder to shake. With further investigation, we may be able to develop treatments based on these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;Screen Time In Bed May Increase Insomnia Odds, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are commonly noted in patients with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, their causal connections to insomnia phenotypes are far from being clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by psychiatrist Shangyun Shi of Nanjing Medical University, used a statistical approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt;. This method looks at genetic variations – which are set at birth and unaffected by lifestyle and other factors – to help determine whether one factor is truly influencing another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing genetic and health data from more than 400,000 people, the researchers found several clear matches. Certain types of bacteria were associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;increased insomnia risk&lt;/a&gt;, while others seemed to lower the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest evidence pointed to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_innocuum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium innocuum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; group of bacteria being linked to a greater risk of insomnia. It's not normally a dangerous kind of bacteria, but it appears to be contributing to sleepless nights for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We identified a total of 14 and 8 bacterial taxa, respectively, as positively and negatively correlated with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers. "In addition, there were reverse effects of insomnia correlated with 19 identified microbial taxa."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171453" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171453" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria.jpg" alt="Insomnia and bacteria" class="wp-image-171453 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria-477x415.jpg 477w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria-600x522.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171453" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team found signs of gut bacteria affecting insomnia, as well as insomnia affecting gut bacteria. (Shi et al., &lt;em&gt;Gen. Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already know the gut-brain axis works in two directions, and previous research has linked it to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-lower-your-stress-it-may-just-take-4-weeks-of-eating-these-kinds-of-food"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-gut-bacteria-link-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-identifies-gut-microbe-imbalances-that-predict-autism-and-adhd"&gt;conditions such as autism and ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this study think that some of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fasting-style-diet-seems-to-result-in-dynamic-changes-in-human-brains"&gt;the chemical reactions&lt;/a&gt; that certain bacteria start or stop might explain the new findings. We're still at the early stages here, and further studies are going to be required in diverse populations – all the participants in this study were of European descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that gut microbes are only one piece of the insomnia puzzle. Other factors can contribute, from stress at work to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-and-insomnia-often-go-together-and-this-could-be-why"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowing what to eat and drink when trying to lose weight can be confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks that you might think are "off-limits" can absolutely fit into a weight loss plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy milk, soy milk and 100% pomegranate juice are a few drinks that can fit into your plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Figuring out the best beverages for weight loss can be exhausting. With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cows-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Cow’s Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that. A 1-cup serving of skim milk delivers 8 grams of protein for just 90 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether you enjoy it on its own for a quick and nutrient-rich snack, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shake with fruit&lt;/a&gt; for an on-the-go meal, or in a bowl of cereal, there’s no shame in adding dairy milk into your meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fortified-soy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Fortified Soy Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-naturally-sweetened-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Naturally Sweetened Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-100-pomegranate-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 100% Pomegranate Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; consumption has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and other markers of cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fruit is rich in polyphenols, good-for-you antioxidant compounds that help rid your body of free radicals and help decrease inflammation. For a nice twist on iced tea, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249903/hibiscus-pomegranate-iced-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-low-calorie-lower-sugar-sodas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Low-Calorie, Lower-Sugar Sodas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest first &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290448/is-drinking-soda-bad-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;switching to diet soda&lt;/a&gt; if you typically drink regular, then, over time, phase soda out completely (other than on occasion). Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-can-drinks-help-with-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Can Drinks Help with Weight Loss? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-know-if-a-drink-is-good-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Know If a Drink Is Good for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Healthy Drink Recipes for Weight Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.

&lt;p&gt;Most sleep advice feels made for someone with no anxiety and a perfect blackout curtain. You’ve probably already tried the magnesium, the screen limits, the warm baths. But a new study suggests something far more physical (and zen-ful) may actually help: high-intensity yoga.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harbin Sport University &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analyzed 30 randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; across more than a dozen countries. They looked at over 2,500 people dealing with sleep disturbances, and found that yoga—especially the kind that makes you sweat—led to the most significant improvement. About 30 minutes twice a week was enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-84377964" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-84377964" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Walking came next. Resistance training followed. Traditional cardio and blended routines didn’t have quite the same effect. Even though past studies have championed aerobic workouts for better sleep, this new meta-analysis gives yoga the edge, especially when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-simple-exercise-may-be-the-closest-thing-to-natural-ambien"&gt;This Simple Exercise May Be the Closest Thing to Natural Ambien&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one’s totally sure why, but breathwork might be the key. The kind used in yoga has been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps pull the body out of high-alert mode. Some research also suggests yoga affects brainwaves, nudging the mind into deeper rest. It works on the body and the nervous system at the same time, in a way that’s hard to replicate with weights or treadmills. There’s also the added benefit of structure—having something to physically do, rather than trying to think your way into calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-66036402" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-66036402" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There are caveats. The researchers note that yoga varies widely in intensity and style, so results can be inconsistent. Plus, sleep disturbances don’t look the same for everyone. What knocks one person out might do nothing for someone else. And not everyone has access to in-person classes or a space at home to stretch out in peace.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, the pattern is clear. Regular movement matters. And when that movement involves your breath and your muscles working together, the payoff might be a longer, better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-74204598" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-74204598" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been trying to nap your way out of insomnia or chew your way through the supplement aisle, maybe it’s time to move instead. You don’t need to become a yoga person. Just pick a flow that pushes you a bit and see what happens. Personally, an intense vinyasa flow in a 95-degree room seems to do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worst case, you get stronger. Best case, you finally sleep through the night without rehashing everything you said or didn’t say that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-79751674" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-79751674" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s easy to blame lack of discipline, too much screen time, or even dull lessons. But often, the missing piece is simpler: food. The brain is the hungriest organ in the body, using up to 20% of a child’s energy. During the school years, when the brain is rapidly forming connections for memory, reasoning, and focus, the fuel it receives can make all the difference. The good news? Brain-friendly foods don’t need to be exotic or expensive. Most are everyday staples that, with a little creativity, can slip easily into meals. Here are six foods every child should eat more often and smart ways to serve them without a battle at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，进化不是随机的，可以预测： “无非是革命性的” - Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/discovery-evolution-not-random-can-be-predicted-pangenome-genetic-history/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the story of evolution has centered on chance – mutations arrive without a plan, and natural selection keeps the winners. That view isn’t wrong, but it’s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study shows that parts of evolution look orderly. Not every genetic outcome is a coin toss. Some genes tend to show up together while others stay separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those tendencies add structure to how genomes change over time, making evolution predictable to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deciphering-the-pangenome"&gt;Deciphering the pangenome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial species carry two kinds of genes: a core set shared by all members and an accessory set that changes from strain to strain. The full collection is called a pangenome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessory genes matter because bacteria can exchange them through horizontal gene transfer. That process spreads useful traits quickly, including resistance to antibiotics, new ways to use nutrients, and tools to handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nottingham Trent University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of this research are nothing short of revolutionary,” enthused Professor McInerney, the lead author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By demonstrating that evolution is not as random as we once thought, we’ve opened the door to an array of possibilities in synthetic biology, medicine, and environmental science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-ai-to-make-gene-predictions"&gt;Using AI to make gene predictions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compiled thousands of E. coli genomes and recorded which accessory genes each strain carries. They turned this into a large presence-absence matrix, with rows for strains and columns for genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trained a machine-learning method called a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-forest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;random forest&lt;/a&gt; to predict whether a gene is present based on the rest of a genome’s accessory gene profile. They trained and tested the model many times to guard against chance splits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model succeeded for a substantial portion of the accessory genome. It could reliably predict the presence or absence of many genes based on the broader gene pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some genes tend to co-occur, likely because they work on connected steps of the same task. Others seldom appear together, often because they overlap in function or interfere with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that some gene families never turned up in a genome when a particular other gene family was already there, and on other occasions, some genes were very much dependent on a different gene family being present,” explained Dr. Domingo-Sananes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-interactions-and-evolution"&gt;Gene interactions and evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not claim that every gene is predictable. Many accessory genes still look erratic, either because local history matters or because there isn’t yet enough data to capture their rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correct forecast does not imply fate. It points to structure – constraints and tendencies – inside which change still happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns held across different parts of the species’ family tree, supporting the idea that selection and gene-gene interactions – not just shared ancestry – shape these outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These interactions between genes make aspects of evolution somewhat predictable, and furthermore, we now have a tool that allows us to make those predictions,” added Dr. Domingo-Sananes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolution-genes-and-healthcare"&gt;Evolution, genes, and healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health teams track antibiotic resistance genes to stay ahead of infections. If certain accessory genes tend to accompany a resistance gene, tests can scan for that supporting set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach can flag trouble earlier, because partner genes may appear before the main gene becomes common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/applied-microbiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;applied microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, teams build strains that make medicines, recycle waste, or capture pollutants. Knowing which gene combinations tend to work well together – and which combinations tend to clash – saves time and money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this work, we can begin to explore which genes ‘support’ an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-is-fueling-antibiotic-resistance-in-our-soils/"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; gene, for example. If we are trying to eliminate antibiotic resistance, we can target not just the focal gene but also its supporting genes,” Dr. Beaven concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach can help synthesize new genetic constructs that may lead to new drugs or vaccines. Knowing what we now know has opened the door to many other discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-read-results"&gt;How to read results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across many genomes, some genes keep showing up together. That’s co-occurrence, and it usually means the genes work on the same job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other pairs almost never share a genome. That’s mutual exclusion. They likely clash or do duplicate work. These patterns leave a fingerprint across the whole pangenome, and a computer model can learn that fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods matter. Scientists group related genes into families and adjust for how closely strains are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also test distant branches of the E. coli family tree. When the patterns still hold, it points to selection and real gene interactions – not just inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-evolution-and-future-studies"&gt;Genes, evolution, and future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practical tools can build on this framework. Diagnostic panels can add partner genes that often travel with targets of concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance can watch for early warning signs in hospital isolates and wastewater. Engineering teams can map friendly and unfriendly gene pairings before they build strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader takeaway remains consistent. In bacteria, a significant slice of the accessory genome behaves in patterned ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those patterns reflect how genes interact and how selection keeps useful partnerships while avoiding costly overlaps. Evolution still surprises, but it also leaves tracks that careful analysis can read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304934120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNRTZoRUhicU9Gd2xpOC1QV1R5MDhhNVlWR0hiVlljYkpjbmtYVGxIcHBZclBTX3JsbGZhN2R2bkJvdnlOXzNMXzJpUEZBUEZzWm85SjdfeGEtazVlNHFZZ2RybS0yYmh3VjJjdHI0N0lxTVRRUXd6OF93ZmNHeG4tWE13UGdndWpKaXk1MklFdHVoU1dUZWtDQUYyalB3VFQzT2hZ</guid></item><item><title>定义他的破折号：当地人的遗产，他太谦虚了，看不到- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51364706/the-dash-that-defined-him-local-mans-legacy-that-he-was-too-humble-to-see</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLACKFOOT, Idaho – When Scott Hancock died of cancer in May, his wife Colleen knew his story was much more than a date of birth and a date of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Scott had written his own obituary, it would have been simple: Born November 18, 1946 – Died May 18, 2025," said Colleen. "I asked him, 'What about the dash?' His real story lies in the dash between those two dates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Hancock never believed he made much of a difference in his life. However, now that he's gone, his wife has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the youngest of five children," Colleen Hancock said. "He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother's shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren't sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. His mother fought for her son's right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School's very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads, but it was something that gave him much pleasure in life. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments, according to Colleen Hancock. He helped write Idaho's Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight," said Colleen. "He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. "There are so many others who do a much better job," he would say. "These are just silly little stories anyone could write."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Author and Island Park News columnist Scott Hancock at a book signing in Island Park with his friend and fellow author EC Stilson of Pocatello. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, "Nobody would believe I really did those things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, he reluctantly "retired." That's when he began writing the "little stories" about his life that grew into two volumes of "Tales from the High Lonesome." They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleen Hancock has since published Volume 3, now available on Amazon, fulfilling the promise she made to her husband to publish it. She plans to combine his remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott's books are available through Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler's Market in Blackfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she emphasizes that writing was just a small part of his accomplishments and who he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Colleen Hancock, sharing his legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Balance relies on the cerebellum and basal ganglia, areas also affected in dementia. A Japanese &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25523051/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people who couldn’t balance well were more likely to have small-vessel disease in the brain and lower cognition. This doesn’t mean failing once predicts dementia, but if balance is consistently poor, it may reflect early neural decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Difficulty rising from a chair or squatting&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple “sit-to-stand” test, where you rise from a chair without using your hands, reflects lower body strength and mobility. Poor performance here has been linked to dementia risk. A UK Biobank &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667032122000361#:~:text=The%20five%2Dtimes%20chair%2Dstand%20test%20greater%20than%2010%20s,with%20advancing%20age%20%5B9%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that slower chair-stand times were tied to a higher chance of future dementia. Experts note that weak legs may signal reduced blood flow and brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since physical strength and cognition share brain pathways, this decline can be an early warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acting out dreams at night&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently kicking, shouting, or punching during sleep may suggest REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), where people act out their dreams. Normally, muscles stay paralyzed during REM sleep, but in RBD, this safety system fails due to early brainstem degeneration. Long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9363360/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that up to 80% of people with idiopathic RBD later develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, often within 10–12 years. If symptoms are present, a sleep study is essential, as early diagnosis allows doctors to manage risks and improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Persistent feelings of loneliness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is more than just being alone—it reflects feeling socially disconnected. Studies show it is linked to higher dementia risk.

Brain scans reveal reduced grey matter in memory regions like the hippocampus, and loneliness is also associated with changes in BDNF, a protein crucial for brain health. Chronic loneliness triggers inflammation and stress pathways that speed up neural decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weak hand grip&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is an easy measure of overall health and frailty. Struggling to open jars or carry groceries can signal weakness that is linked to brain decline.

Weaker grip may relate to inflammation, reduced activity, and early frailty. The good news is strength can be improved—resistance training, protein-rich diets, and targeted hand exercises have been shown to boost grip and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>如果您超过60岁，心脏病专家恳求您多吃这种高纤维食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/cardiologists-begging-eat-more-high-122500730.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foods you eat can have a big impact on specific areas of your wellbeing, including your &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-you-should-never-do-if-you-want-to-lower-heart-attack-risk-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.

Uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to blood vessel damage, ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/health-threats-from-high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raising the odds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;raising the odds&lt;/a&gt; of having a heart attack, congestive heart failure and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting in enough fiber also helps with weight management and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-sugar-naturally" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, “all of which can help reduce the risk of heart disease,” Dr. Chen says. Having chronically high blood sugar levels can contribute to type 2 diabetes, a condition that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/diabetes-complications/diabetes-and-your-heart.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:doubles the risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;doubles the risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing heart disease. But the fiber in oatmeal can actively work against this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-to-your-blood-pressure-when-you-skip-breakfast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here’s Exactly What Happens to Your Blood Pressure if You Skip Breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here’s Exactly What Happens to Your Blood Pressure if You Skip Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is typically categorized into two groups: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1172611/ericasweeney/foods-high-in-soluble-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber interacts with water to create a gel-like substance in the gut, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002136.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Soluble fiber is typically found in foods like oats and oatmeal, peas, apples, citrus fruits, and many vegetables. Soluble fiber is especially known for its &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol-lowering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol-lowering&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Some forms may lower the risk of heart disease, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insoluble fiber is a type of fiber that doesn’t dissolve in water. It’s found in foods like wheat bran, vegetables and whole grains, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool and seems to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/high-fiber-smoothie-recipes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:It’s Hot Out!

But it can be especially helpful to have them with other things, according to Dr. Behuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When eating oats, pair them with a source of protein and healthy fat, such as &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1352061/alexandramallon/types-of-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1371009/emily-laurence/pumpkin-seeds-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happened-when-i-ate-yogurt-every-day-for-a-week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, to help keep blood sugar levels steady,” she says. This can also help to keep you feeling fuller, longer, Dr. Behuria adds. Adding in fellow fiber-rich foods like berries or apples can also increase your intake of the macronutrient, Dr. Chen points out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while Dr. Chen agrees that oatmeal is a great source of fiber when you’re over 60, he says it shouldn’t be the only source of the macronutrient that you eat. “It is important to get your fiber from a variety of sources, ideally through whole unprocessed foods or minimally processed foods,” he adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re not currently eating a lot of oatmeal or having much fiber, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/health/essential-nutrients/carbohydrates/fiber" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Academy of Dietetics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Academy of Dietetics&lt;/a&gt; suggests ramping it up slowly in order to give your body time to adjust.
