  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzmy00183b79jxunhd9p@published"&gt;I’m a 59-year-old gay man who had a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostatectomy/about/pac-20385198"&gt;prostatectomy&lt;/a&gt; last year. I often receive aggressive, in-person flirtation from nice guys who obviously want to hook up casually. I owe them a warning, though.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69usp6002p3b794seao9jb@published"&gt;I desperately want to say yes (with precautions), but when do I tell them that I won’t get hard? I’m a passionate guy who enjoys a lot of things, and can still have wild, dry orgasms. Rejecting a blowjob comes off as rejecting the person. Mentioning my prostate cancer is a mood killer for a casual flirtation, but guys take it personally if we make out and I don’t get hard (even though I’m totally into it). I have a BiMix prescription, but even then, it’s not very portable, and I have to excuse myself awkwardly. What explanation do I owe them, and when? If it’s a dealbreaker, I’m wasting their time. Nobody seems to understand the sad side effects of this surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzz4001c3b79d1cvklos@published"&gt;I feel for you and agree—the effects of a prostatectomy are not discussed very often in mainstream forums. Especially lacking is how they impact gay sex. It sounds like you’re handling yours well, though. I don’t know for sure if your sign-off is a true reflection of how you’ve modified your sexual practices to your current abilities/interests, but if so: Bravo. You’re finding your way despite unfair limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o02j001d3b79au1uvheh@published"&gt;If you are identifying as a bottom, it is completely reasonable to say upfront to potential partners that your dick is off limits, especially in casual encounters. Plenty of bottoms don’t get hard and/or put no focus on their penises during sex. This may disappoint some vers/top guys, but it won’t turn them all off. The negative reactions you’ve received about your lack of erection won’t necessarily be the norm—you may just have encountered a less-than-ideal sample. You’re nearly 60 years old, and it’s not uncommon for guys to have erectile issues as they get older. You don’t have to explain yourself or talk about your surgery. They can take it or leave it. This may result in rejection, but so might identifying as a total top in the event that one encounters another total top. It’s OK to not be for everyone, as exciting as it is to be pursued on a mass scale. Let people take their disappointment and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o05u001e3b79p4vz3trx@published"&gt;So for hookups, I’d say you owe little to no explanation. You’re doing what you’re doing, it doesn’t involve your dick being hard, and that is that. If you were to embark on regular sex with someone, whether a sex bud or a boyfriend, that’s when you might want to say something. You’d want to do it sometime around when you notice things getting less anonymous. At that point, your partner will have already liked what you’ve offered so far, and hopefully, will be happy just keeping things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o0bx001f3b79rhxkev2t@published"&gt;Familiarity might make the BiMix injection process a bit less awkward, too. Regarding that medication, it’s worth trying to break down the awkwardness you feel about that. It’s not ideal, but look at how amazing medical technology is! If someone really wants to play with your hard dick, there is a good chance that he will be accepting of whatever method you use to achieve it. Having to use drugs to achieve and maintain an erection can be humbling, but if you try to focus on the practicality, it may make it easier. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69qjso001q3b79nw31snsd@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for almost 11 years and have been together for 15. I have tried to have many conversations about sex and they are hardly productive. I have tried many of the common suggestions for improving sexual frequency, having a set day/time for it, asking her what I can do to turn her on, etc. But every suggestion is brushed off, she wants our sex life to be spontaneous, or she just has to be in the right mood to do it, and while I respect her answers to these questions they don’t help me figure out what I can do to help. Over the past year, I know she has made an effort to increase frequency for me, and I GREATLY appreciate it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/wife-requests-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, there is a hitch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3742439f-b630-44f6-a55f-6a8b01b29fe8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 35-year-old woman in Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The woman was referred to a hospital following a miscarriage at seven weeks of pregnancy. Leading up to the hospital visit, the woman's gynecologist had decided to check the patient's chromosomes to see if there was an underlying genetic reason for the pregnancy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="3742439f-b630-44f6-a55f-6a8b01b29fe8-2"&gt;The most common karyotype, or chromosomal profile, for a woman is 46,XX. The 46 indicates 23 pairs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in each cell. Two of these are sex chromosomes, which are usually XX for women and XY for men. However, the tests revealed that the patient's karyotype for her blood cells was 46,XY — the typical karyotype for a male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="93f18359-d078-4d4a-b8bd-691da082f3d2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; At the hospital, doctors performed two additional blood tests and ordered more tests to examine other chromosomes in the woman's body. Her skin cell karyotype was 46,XX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors then conducted a physical examination of the patient. Her visible traits were female, and they found no abnormalities in her genitals or reproductive system. Her hormone production was also within the normal range. As an adolescent, her sexual development had been normal, she told the doctors, with regular menstruation that began when she was 13 years old. There were no unusual health incidents in her medical history, and she was the first person in her family to be tested for a potential genetic disorder, the physicians wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452014425001554" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452014425001554" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describing her case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors identified her condition as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chimerism" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chimerism" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chimerism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which the body contains at least two different sets of DNA across different cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can sometimes happen after a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.845490/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.845490/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood transfusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2955429/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2955429/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;organ transplant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which one person receives tissues (and thus DNA) from another individual. But chimerism can also happen naturally, when several fertilized eggs fuse in the uterus to produce a single fetus, or when cells and their DNA are "traded" in the womb. This swap can occur between a mother and an embryo, and sometimes between twins that share the same placenta or whose individual placentas interact in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4fXrfyRTxQtmBzYmv6TnxR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4fXrfyRTxQtmBzYmv6TnxR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in this case had a twin brother. When the doctors analyzed samples from the woman's brother and parents, they found genetic variants in the twin brother's XY blood cells that matched those in the patient's blood. They concluded that during fetal development, the woman had incorporated her twin's DNA into her blood cells while still retaining a different copy of DNA with XX chromosomes in the rest of her body's tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a transfusion process that we call feto-fetal transfusion," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.gmaciel.com.br/en-about/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.gmaciel.com.br/en-about/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gustavo Arantes Rosa Maciel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the report and a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of São Paulo, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/afrique/articles/cdx264g3qw2o" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bbc.com/afrique/articles/cdx264g3qw2o" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BBC News Africa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (translated from French). "At some point, the veins and arteries of the two children became intertwined in the umbilical cord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outcome: &lt;/strong&gt;About 11 months after the patient's miscarriage and after she had completed testing at the hospital, the woman became pregnant again. As a precaution due to her prior miscarriage, the doctors prescribed supplements of the hormone progesterone to be given vaginally during the pregnancy. There were no complications, and she gave birth to a healthy boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;In most cases of people with chimerism involving sex chromosomes, their condition carries substantial physical or reproductive issues. This is the first known example of complete blood chimerism in a woman who otherwise had typical female traits, had no health issues and was able to get pregnant. The case suggests that chimerism in humans is not necessarily a barrier to reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="34ac9136-061a-49cd-add9-3fb1087a9b0e"&gt;This is also the first case in the medical literature of a patient becoming a chimera in the womb via her twin's blood, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And notably, even the karyotyping test for identifying the woman's condition is not commonly performed. It is not part of a standard medical visit. Therefore, it is unknown how common it is for individuals to carry hidden chromosomal anomalies, and incidences of blood chimerism are likely underreported as a result, the authors wrote. Indeed, studies have suggested that other types of chromosomal variations, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/men-with-extra-sex-chromosomes-study" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/men-with-extra-sex-chromosomes-study"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as having extra sex chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are also underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="4c484b4f-721d-4e5f-8be6-5f7fc4e26822"&gt;

For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: "A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there was still "room for doubt and for clarification from further research".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was "urgently needed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Food and Drink Federation says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines," says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation, which represents industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Current UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:53:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9tbmQ2bngtODhXdmdMWm03Rmk3QWI3NXJUMlVhUjF4ZVEtdnE2WUpOWklTUVd4RmE2RHhTRnlkbnBEWG9kazhiZmg2ZFNlRy1KbWRIamNvRUxZUdIBX0FVX3lxTE42dWdXSU8ycEFsd0RkQ0RfQjZvc0FCU1RteEJqSktTYlYtLUYwZ3dCRjhHdWFvamd1eVFnOFhqM1I2Z0NLUFV3aEx1RWZBa1BBaEVobXdiNkZHdkhreFZ3</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州现在是全国幼儿园麻疹疫苗接种率最低的地区之一--《星报》</title><link>https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-now-has-one-of-the-nations-lowest-kindergarten-measles-vaccination-rates/601471694</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;Vercel Security Checkpoint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="hide-mobile" data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;|&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;sfo1::1763562901-TMw3WpD2l452rQTSIPJ4ZSvuv3Ylxfec&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNMnd3cFpOUVJLOW1aZ3podXZSQXFkWVFBVHdDYjBBRGJ5SmZOeFpQZnliaFd1dk43OGRTaVVNcDk3UVlLeG0zVFk4MG0ySWhsLUtMUWQxZ2xyXzU2T0V4LXJXcnAwbTRoWGZIRUhOLUFOejhLSlZyYzM5WjJXMC1fdTBUZTEzbEs2VVBhU2docjdIXzJPaHJuYlY2WWkzT25FZ3dPLUJyaU5oeldlc2dyakJYYks2YlhtYmRGYQ</guid></item><item><title>人类在青藏高原上眼前进化- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-are-evolving-in-front-of-our-eyes-on-the-tibetan-plateau</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Mountain climbers often experience &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/altitude-sickness"&gt;altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; – the body's reaction to a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, which means less oxygen is taken in with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, in high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, where &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-drug-mimics-the-health-effects-of-living-at-high-altitude"&gt;oxygen levels in the air people breathe&lt;/a&gt; are notably low, human communities thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthals-may-never-have-truly-gone-extinct-study-reveals"&gt;Neanderthals May Never Have Truly Gone Extinct, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over more than 10,000 years of settlement in the region, the bodies of those living there have changed in ways that allow the inhabitants to make the most of an atmosphere that for most humans would result in not enough oxygen being delivered via blood cells to the body's tissues, a condition known as hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia is fascinating because the stress is severe, experienced equally by everyone at a given altitude, and quantifiable," anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in the US told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a beautiful example of how and why our species has so much biological variation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beall has been studying the human response to hypoxic living conditions &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701985104"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;. In research published in October 2024, she and her team revealed some of the specific adaptations in Tibetan communities: traits that improve the blood's ability to deliver oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To unlock this discovery, the researchers looked into one of the markers of what we call evolutionary fitness: reproductive success. Women who deliver live babies are those who pass on their traits to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traits that maximize an individual's success in a given environment are most likely to be found in women who are able to survive the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141134" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lo Manthang in Nepal, where some of the data was collected.

Those offspring, having inherited survivability traits from their mothers, are also more likely to survive, reproduce, and carry those same traits forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-black-death-shaped-human-evolution-and-were-still-in-its-shadow"&gt;natural selection at work&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be a bit &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mutation-that-helped-ancient-humans-survive-frostbite-also-gave-us-arthritis"&gt;strange and counterintuitive&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-variation-in-blood-type-helps-prevent-the-deadliest-form-of-malaria"&gt;places where malaria is common&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the incidence of sickle cell anemia is high, because it &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00384-9"&gt;involves a gene that protects against malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beall and her team studied 417 women aged 46 to 86 who had lived their entire lives in Nepal at altitudes above 3,500 meters (11,480 feet). The researchers recorded their number of live births – ranging from 0 to 14 per woman, with an average of 5.2 – along with physical and health measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the things they measured were levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein in red blood cells responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues. They also measured how much oxygen was being carried by the hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the women who demonstrated the highest rate of live births had hemoglobin levels that were neither high nor low, but average for the testing group. But the oxygen saturation of their hemoglobin was high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that the adaptations are able to maximize oxygen delivery to cells and tissues &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; thickening the blood – an outcome that would increase stress on the heart as it struggles to pump a higher viscosity fluid more resistant to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141135" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-552x415.jpg 552w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation.

Craig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previously we knew that lower hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that an intermediate value has the highest benefit. We knew that higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that the higher the saturation the more beneficial. The number of live births quantifies the benefits," Beall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was unexpected to find that women can have many live births with low values of some oxygen transport traits if they have favorable values of other oxygen transport traits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lead-exposure-may-have-given-ancient-humans-an-edge-over-neanderthals"&gt;Lead Exposure May Have Given Ancient Humans an Edge Over Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women with the highest reproductive success rate also had a high rate of blood flow into the lungs, and their hearts had wider than average left ventricles, the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, these traits increase the rate of oxygen transport and delivery, enabling the human body to make the most of the low oxygen in the air respired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that cultural factors can play a role, too. Women who start reproducing young and have long marriages seem to have a longer exposure to the possibility of pregnancy, which also increases the number of live births, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even taking that into account, however, the physical traits played a role. Nepalese women with physiologies most similar to women in unstressed, low-altitude environments tended to have the highest rate of reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a case of ongoing natural selection," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Beall said&lt;/a&gt;. "Understanding how populations like these adapt gives us a better grasp of the processes of human evolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403309121"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you get a small cut, you might throw a plastic bandage on it to help it heal faster. However, there are fancier options on the horizon, &lt;a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2025/09/smart-device-ai-bioelectronics-speed-up-wound-healing/" target="_blank"&gt;like this advanced AI-powered smart bandage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a proof-of-concept device called a-Heal, intended for use inside existing commercial bandages for colostomy use. The device is fitted with a small camera, which images the wound site every two hours. The images are then uploaded via a wireless connection, and processed with a machine learning model that has been trained to make suggestions on how to better stimulate the healing process based on the image input. The device can then follow these recommendations, either using electrical stimulation to reduce inflammation in the wound, or supplying fluoxetine to stimulate the growth of healthy tissue. In testing, the device was able to improve the rate of skin coverage over an existing wound compared to a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term goal is to apply the technology in a broader sense to help better treat things like chronic or infected wounds that may have difficulty healing. It’s still at an early stage for now, but it could one day be routine for medical treatment to involve the use of small smart devices to gain a better rolling insight on the treatment of wounds. It’s not the first time we’ve explored innovative methods of wound care; we’ve previously looked at &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/05/18/revisiting-folk-wisdom-for-modern-chronic-wound-care/"&gt;how treatments from the past could better inform how we treat in future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two years after treatment, the group's glucose levels had significantly decreased, alongside markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-links-gum-disease-with-white-matter-damage-in-the-brain"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Links Gum Disease With White Matter Damage in The Brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high blood sugar level is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;leading risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that root canal treatment doesn't just improve oral health – it may also help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182174" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and endodontologist Sadia Niazi from King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a powerful reminder that oral health is deeply connected to overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182201" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-642x359.png" alt="Root Canal" class="size-medium wp-image-182201" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-642x359.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-1200x672.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-768x430.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-1536x860.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal-600x336.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/RootCanal.png 1926w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182201" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Root canal infections can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, leading to inflammation and potential metabolic consequences. Successful treatment reduces these risks. (&lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study had no control group and was observational, meaning the results can't be used to determine cause and effect, but the team suspects that chronic infections of the tissues in and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-cause-of-alzheimers-might-be-coming-from-within-your-mouth"&gt;around the teeth&lt;/a&gt; may seep into circulation and trigger broader inflammatory changes, affecting the very chemistry of our blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This state of inflammation, in turn, could potentially influence insulin resistance and compromise blood sugar control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That idea needs further testing, but the general premise is supported by emerging evidence linking oral health to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-tooth-loss-linked-to-risk-of-fatal-heart-disease-study-finds"&gt;death and disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increasingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mouth-rinse-could-reveal-early-warning-signs-of-heart-disease"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poor oral hygiene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; can take a toll on the cardiovascular system. In a recent, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;surprising study&lt;/a&gt;, published in September, scientists found oral bacteria in the arterial plaque of those with coronary artery disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034516660509"&gt;&lt;span&gt;some estimates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, people with infectious lesions in and around their teeth may face more than double the risk of developing coronary artery disease down the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To test whether inflammatory markers, driven by oral infections, are linked to metabolic health, researchers turned to patients with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapical_periodontitis"&gt;apical periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (AP) – a chronic inflammatory condition triggered by bacterial invasion into the pulp and root of teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blood samples were taken at five points: before root canal treatment, and then 3 months, 6 months, one year, and 2 years after treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers measured a total of 44 metabolites in the blood, either linked to inflammation or metabolism. Following root canal treatment, just over half of the metabolites had changed significantly, particularly amino acids, glucose, and lipids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after treatment, cholesterol had temporarily dropped. A key amino acid group associated with insulin resistance had also declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvements to blood glucose levels took longer to show up, appearing at the two-year mark. This coincided with a drop in pyruvate, a compound that affects inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If root canal treatment really can resolve cases of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"&gt;hyperglycemia&lt;/a&gt;, researchers think it could potentially mediate an individual's risk of developing serious cardiovascular consequences down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One challenge with measuring metabolites in the blood, however, is that scientists still don't really know how they all function or interact. There are thousands of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt; circulating that can be measured, yet we often only know which health conditions they are associated with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking at just 44 metabolites can only give scientists a snapshot of what is going on, but the results are intriguing enough that the authors are calling for more research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is vital that dental professionals recognize the wider impact of these root canal infections and advocate for early diagnosis and treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/root-canal-treatment-reduces-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also need to move towards integrated care, where dentists and general practitioners work together to monitor the risks through these blood markers and protect overall health. It's time to move beyond the tooth and embrace a truly holistic approach to dental care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07110-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earworm, however, can go only so far in explaining why these drugs are all the rage. Semaglutide (sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy), and related &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; receptor agonists, such as tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound), wouldn’t be as popular as they are if they did not have dramatic results. For example, those who regularly inject themselves with these medications lose, on average, about &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;15 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of their body weight. This has led some commentators to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2023-in-review/the-year-of-ozempic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt; a potential ‘Ozempic revolution’, in which the obesity epidemic – ‘a problem that our high-tech society invented’ – also has a high-tech, pharmaceutical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications mimic glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-017-4289-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; the release of insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; appetite and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877820301769?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine, prolonging satiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drugs also seem to quiet persistent, intrusive thoughts about food (so-called ‘food noise’) and may &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce&lt;/a&gt; cravings in general. Although scientists are just beginning to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-025-00382-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; food noise as a concept, individuals who have taken a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drug often &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that it significantly reduces this distracting, ruminative thinking about food – a near-constant background hum of unwanted food-related thoughts, feelings and desires that may contribute to making poor food choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ozempic and its siblings end up revolutionising the treatment of obesity, it will primarily be through its powerful physiological mechanisms of action. However, when drugs become blockbusters, they can have equally profound indirect effects on public consciousness, changing the way we think about the conditions they are designed to treat. Consider, for example, how the popularity of antidepressants such as Prozac has changed how we think about depression and other mood disorders – helping to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/10/07/did-the-blockbuster-prozac-help-or-hurt-medicine/prozac-reduced-stigma-of-depression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;destigmatise&lt;/a&gt; these illnesses, but also catalysing broader conversations about how personality and the self relate to neurophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this score, GLP-1 medications have yet to live up to their full potential. Or, rather, since the cultural impact of novel medications is determined by our reactions to them, not by the medications themselves, we have yet to live up to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; full potential in reflecting on them and unpacking their implications. (If anything, in our current media environment, the widespread use of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs has reinforced the cultural obsession with being thin.) Thinking carefully about how these medications work can help us develop a more accurate understanding of appetite and self-control – and thereby improve the way we see obesity and people affected &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;by it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;verweight people are often &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0803-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stigmatised&lt;/a&gt; as lazy, with no willpower or self-discipline. On this view, those who want to lose weight should simply try harder to eat well and exercise. When these additional efforts fail, as they &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-024-00551-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; do, overweight individuals might &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223890701331856#d1e314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;feel&lt;/a&gt; shame or guilt. This emotional response can &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/03/news-weight-stigma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exacerbate&lt;/a&gt; unhealthy eating behaviours, discourage people from seeking medical advice, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997407/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;create&lt;/a&gt; a vicious cycle in which weight stigma and weight gain reinforce each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic’s effects on those who use it suggest that weight management may actually have little to do with raw willpower. Taking the drug does not help you lose weight by strengthening your will to overcome cravings for high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods. Rather, it weakens those cravings, and silences ‘food noise’, so that you don’t even need willpower to resist them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, it seems likely that a person’s weight is more strongly determined by the intensity of their desires and appetites than by the strength of their will. If this is right, thinner people shouldn’t be valorised for supposedly being strong-willed, and overweight individuals shouldn’t be disparaged for being weak or feckless. Someone who is overweight may have just as much willpower as a thinner person but need to deploy this willpower against stronger desires for food. In effect, thinner individuals might be getting credit for winning a battle that they never had to fight. As one member of an online weight loss group &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/27/will-the-ozempic-era-change-how-we-think-about-being-fat-and-being-thin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; after taking a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; medication, ‘it is no wonder that skinny people think heavy people have no willpower. Their brains actually do tell them to stop eating. I had no idea.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We do not directly control our appetites; the heart (or stomach, in this case) wants what it wants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get clearer about the effects of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs on self-control by drawing on a distinction between two different ways of acting moderately, which traces back to Aristotle. The first kind of moderate action lines up with how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; people think of self-control: effortfully resisting doing something that you believe you shouldn’t do. The ancient Greek word for this form of moderation is &lt;em&gt;enkrateia&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually translated into English as ‘continence’ (despite its contemporary associations with bladder control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, Ozempic does not seem to make those who take it more continent; it doesn’t help them resist strong temptations to eat more than they think they should. Rather, taking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs brings people closer to the other form of moderation: &lt;em&gt;sophrosyne&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually translated as ‘temperance’. While the continent person experiences many tempting desires and successfully resists them, the temperate person doesn’t face temptations in the first place. A temperate person’s appetites are in perfect harmony with her judgments about what it is best to do. If a temperate person believes that she should eat only a single piece of cheesecake after a big dinner, then she will want only that single piece, and will be satisfied once she’s eaten it, even when faced with a dessert tray full of other delicious treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden

class="pointer-coarse:-inset-4 -inset-1 absolute"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not directly control our appetites; the heart (or stomach, in this case) wants what it wants. Simply deciding to be temperate is not likely to be effective. In part this is because both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2008127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appetite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00261-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415002615%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; are highly heritable: in any given environment, a large fraction of their variance between individuals is attributable to genetics. Although environmental factors – an increase in sedentary lifestyles and greater availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods – explain why average obesity levels have gone up worldwide, genetic &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00414-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; partially explain why some individuals gain more weight than others in these ‘obesogenic’ environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938415300226?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that these gene-by-environment interactions are partly due to the genetically determined differences in appetite. Individuals who inherit a stronger appetite – those who are more responsive to food cues and less sensitive to satiety signals – are simply more susceptible to obesogenic environments. They are more likely to overeat in response to a food environment in which high-calorie, low-nutrient foods are readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory meshes nicely with the idea that &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; medications work in part by moderating appetite and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-024-01460-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; feelings of fullness. If you are not among the lucky few who are naturally temperate with respect to food, taking Ozempic or one of its peers helps you approximate temperance – bringing your appetite into line with your beliefs about what, and how much, you &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;should eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he notion that willpower and resistance are overrated when it comes to weight is backed up by recent research on self-control. Surprisingly, being a highly self-controlled person seems mainly to involve using proactive strategies to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914005339?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/3446/chapter/116770/Of-Marshmallows-and-Moderation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;manage&lt;/a&gt; temptations, rather than being &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-018-9721-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; at directly and effortfully &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/per.1899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resisting&lt;/a&gt; them through sheer willpower. In this way, actual self-controlled humans don’t seem to fit the traditional picture of continence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-controlled individuals don’t fit the traditional conception of temperance, either: their appetites aren’t automatically in agreement with their judgments about what’s best to do. Instead, they take indirect steps to nip potential temptations in the bud. For example, someone who might be tempted to eat an entire chocolate bar at once if they buy one in the grocery store checkout line might avoid this temptation by choosing a register where candy is not displayed, or by distracting themselves from the array of chocolate. Or, if they already have chocolate at home, they might &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40575102?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reframe&lt;/a&gt; how they think about it – say, as a treat reserved for special times – to moderate their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a more accurate &lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Rethinking-Self-Control/Haug/p/book/9781032710082?srsltid=AfmBOooSim6FgaCeBNPr7_p9fKMdI9AkubnG_La2twTtnnJaxKIPRcWZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of self-control reconceives it as flexibly organising our lives so that we are less likely to be in situations where strong temptations arise, and changing our patterns of thought so that the temptations we do encounter are easier to resist. Ozempic and similar drugs are a way of proactively managing temptation, and their effects lend further support to this reconceptualisation of what it means to be self-controlled. The success of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/span&gt; drugs ought to shift the emphasis away from willpower and continence, revealing these forms of self-regulation to be burdensome and ineffective for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications do not work for everyone and, at least in the US, they are &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/dem/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-launches-investigation-into-outrageously-high-price-of-ozempic-and-wegovy-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt;, which raises concerns about equitable access. Injecting Ozempic may not be a panacea for obesity. But reflecting on why these drugs work, when they do work, can still reinforce valuable &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220941242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lessons&lt;/a&gt; about self-control. It can help us move beyond the myth that highly self-controlled individuals just use superior willpower to inhibit their impulses and cravings. It can remind anyone who has passed judgment on those affected by obesity that simply trying harder to eat differently is not likely to be effective. And it affirms that struggling with one’s weight does not make someone lazier or mentally weaker than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Psyche</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPX2FsT1JqNnNwczN3NUkxV1ZIb1k0UHlQQlBwTmJWS1ZNbWQ3WGV5UldMaDVONlk3MDIwVTZCM0hTRnBPTXh2SUZ3SDZIU203Q3VQZFVKMVhwUWpYZ1dNLWhqWVVlVGZvWDNqM3JTQWFwMWpBQ3NQclNhMmtDMWZQMVFRMmtDTGpKcEJZX21R</guid></item><item><title>今年冬天流感季节可能会很糟糕- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Doctors note that getting the flu shot is a good way to be prepared for what's feared could be a rough season for the illness.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The signs are, it could be a big season," says &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/webby-lab/webby-lab-team.html" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Webby&lt;/a&gt;, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. "The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere," Webby says. "It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; flu tracker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And H3N2 viruses "tend to be a little bit more problematic," Webby says. "When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers" target="_blank"&gt;Caitlin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. "And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And she says the flu shot this year "may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season," Rivers says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years," Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning "whether vaccines are safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that they are," she says. "And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: "It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The statement added: "The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t need to wait to get information back and classify you as drug sensitive, this or that regimen. There is no need to go through all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Access to swift diagnostic tests for TB is patchy and it can take days or weeks in some places for doctors to get laboratories to identify the TB type a patient has before they can be helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr William Brumskine, clinical research site leader at the Aurum Institute in Rustenburg, South &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, said he hoped overall care would be improved. “The hope of having a universal regimen that is shorter, that has less side-effects, is you will have less individuals coming in for clinic visits [and so] the health care providers will have more time to give individual care to patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2692e17f-4fc2-463e-8bbc-8152b2e93a56" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Phase-2 trials of a sorfequiline-based regimen at the University of Cape Town Lung Institute.

The current gold-standard treatment, introduced in 2019, successfully treats 90% of people within six months.

    &lt;p&gt;Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/messages/pandemic-center-tracking-report-12770578?e=87eb75ed9e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;are surging&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-deaths-us-most-since-2017/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program, who resigned in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/whooping-cough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt;, whooping cough was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;one of the most common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; childhood diseases and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-16-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;major cause of childhood death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;8 in 10 toddlers&lt;/a&gt; had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the COVID pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas logged &lt;a href="https://www.tarrantcountytx.gov/content/dam/main/public-health/han-documents/TCPH_pertussis_HAN_05_25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1,928 pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. By October 2025, the state had &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;exceeded 3,500&lt;/a&gt;. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r704" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;6,600 cases&lt;/a&gt; — four times last year's pace and 25 times 2023's. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn't regional. It's everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key factors behind these numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that &lt;a href="https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/bills/89th-legislature-hb-1586/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;made it easier&lt;/a&gt; for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, "our whole front downstairs area is packed," he said. "We did not see that this year."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. "We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity," he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the COVID and influenza vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to "acellular" ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Babies face the greatest risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-during-pregnancy.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the mother's antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials once promoted "cocooning," vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;no longer widely recommended&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better testing finds more cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589663/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;PCR testing&lt;/a&gt; is also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surv-manual/php/table-of-contents/chapter-10-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;uncovering more pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A growing worry: antibiotic resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors normally treat pertussis with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/antibiotic-resistance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide-resistant pertussis&lt;/a&gt; has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/pregnant-april-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 60%&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts say solutions must match the problem's complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/increase-pertussis-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;issued alerts&lt;/a&gt; in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when COVID funding ended. But staffing is still limited. "There's just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. "We don't have that yet. … It's not real time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the youngest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, COVID, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep sick visitors away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Martin Kulldorff, chair of the Trump administration’s reconstituted CDC vaccine panel, made a shocking — and misleading — statement as the group met in September. Referring to a clinical trial, Kulldorff, a biostatistician and former professor at Harvard Medical School, said eight babies born to women who received Pfizer’s covid vaccine while pregnant had birth defects, compared with two born to unvaccinated women.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“It is very concerning to have a fourfold excess risk of birth defects in these pregnant women,” Kulldorff then said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists criticized Kulldorff’s questions and remarks in that meeting because they suggested that the vaccine caused birth defects, which is &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;not supported by evidence&lt;/a&gt;. The birth defects would have occurred before the women received the vaccine, the scientists said. They say it was one of several scientifically unsubstantiated claims by newly appointed members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an influential panel that guides which vaccines millions of people receive and whether insurance covers their cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the new panel members share a connection to a little-known think tank making its mark in President Donald Trump’s Washington: the Brownstone Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Libertarian author Jeffrey Tucker created the nonprofit institute in 2021, fueled by &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/about/"&gt;backlash against covid lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; and other pandemic-era policies. “You cannot do something like that to the world and expect people just to sit by and go, ‘OK, that’s normal,’” Tucker said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker &lt;a href="https://fee.org/articles/let-the-kids-work/"&gt;has endorsed child labor&lt;/a&gt;; said of &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1936406697062314256"&gt;covid shots&lt;/a&gt; that “there is no evidence at all that the vaccines saved millions,” contradicting &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing the opposite; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1971876720190914608"&gt;opposes vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His institute’s covid contrarians seek to limit the government’s role in protecting Americans from disease. The Austin, Texas-based think tank &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196172-brownstone-institute-2021-990/#document/p1"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196168-brownstone-institute-2023-990/#document/p1"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26196167-brownstone-institute-2024-990/#document/p1"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; from donors whose identities are shielded in tax filings. And in recent months, its associates have catapulted to the highest levels of government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least eight people with ties to the Brownstone Institute hold or recently held senior positions at federal health agencies or key roles advising the government, exercising significant authority over access to vaccines and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They include Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, which has been racked by funding cuts and firings under the Trump administration, as well as senior Food and Drug Administration officials Vinay Prasad and Tracy Beth Høeg. Prasad has been involved in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187671/download"&gt;restricting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187542/download?attachment"&gt;the use&lt;/a&gt; of covid vaccines. Høeg has &lt;a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/cdc-is-endangering-childhood-vaccination-progress"&gt;voiced skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about vaccine mandates and some childhood immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya was a senior scholar for the organization. Brownstone has published &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;Bhattacharya’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/vinay-prasad/"&gt;Prasad’s&lt;/a&gt; writings on its website. Høeg has reported &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;payment&lt;/a&gt; from the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The institute has &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/"&gt;compensated Kulldorff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/martin-kulldorff/"&gt;published his articles&lt;/a&gt;. Tucker &lt;a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/the-great-barrington-declaration-at-five-years-5924026?utm_source=ref_share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;amp;rs=SHRNCMMW"&gt;wrote in October&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 marked “the beginning of a long friendship” with Kulldorff “that continues to this day.” Three other ACIP members share connections with the organization: MIT operations management professor Retsef Levi, who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-supper-club-west-hartford-september-2025-retsef-levi/"&gt;has spoken&lt;/a&gt; as part of at least one Brownstone event; physician Robert Malone, who&lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/rwmalonemd/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/reclaim-your-independence/"&gt;speaks at its events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/rwmalonemd/"&gt;whose articles appear on its website&lt;/a&gt;; and Case Western Reserve University professor and epidemiologist Catherine Stein, who in 2022 &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;authored an article&lt;/a&gt; calling for an end to vaccine mandates at universities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas Buckley, a public relations professional who wrote for the institute, accepted a political appointment as a top NIH spokesperson after thousands of workers at the biomedical research agency &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-workers-protest-federal-cuts-bhattacharya-trump-american-health/"&gt;were fired&lt;/a&gt;. Buckley &lt;a href="https://thomas699.substack.com/p/about-the-last-four-years?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;noted on Substack&lt;/a&gt; that his &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/thomas-buckley/"&gt;Brownstone writings&lt;/a&gt; “led to my new job.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s maybe his judgment,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Buckley, when asked to elaborate, said in an email that he interviewed Bhattacharya “for a story that was later published on Brownstone — it was simply me being polite.” He said he resigned from the NIH on Sept. 30. NIH spokesperson Laci Williams declined to confirm his departure date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the ascendence of those with ties to his group, Tucker said that “anybody who thinks that somehow Brownstone is some big plot, it’s crazy.” He said he is not in regular contact with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose department oversees the CDC, FDA, and NIH.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any influence,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sowing Vaccine Doubt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with ties to the institute have sown doubt about covid vaccines or routine childhood immunizations, dismissing widespread evidence that they are safe and the benefits outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve successfully placed their ideology inside the mechanism that determines U.S. vaccine policy,” said Jake Scott, a physician at Stanford Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. “It’s very, very troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said that Brownstone “doesn’t have any operational impact on the ACIP committee at all” and that “if somebody wasn’t troubled by Brownstone, there’s probably no reason for us to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker and Brownstone’s associates express libertarian views and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/faucis-lies-are-catching-up-with-him/"&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/cdc-continues-to-torture-the-data/"&gt;distrust of government&lt;/a&gt;, including public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!” Levi &lt;a href="https://x.com/RetsefL/status/1619945525670981632"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, referring to vaccines based on messenger RNA technology, which Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna used to develop their covid shots. &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;Stein wrote&lt;/a&gt; that covid vaccine mandates are “unethical” and not scientifically justified. Bhattacharya asserted on a podcast with Trump ally Stephen Bannon that mRNA technology for vaccines is “&lt;a href="https://omny.fm/shows/real-america-s-voice/the-war-room-with-stephen-k-bannon-ep-4696"&gt;no longer viable&lt;/a&gt;,” and he has overseen &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf"&gt;mass terminations of NIH grants&lt;/a&gt; for scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy in June fired all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine panel and has replaced them with 12 people so far, including individuals with connections to the Brownstone Institute. Tucker said that he did not propose to the White House or HHS that they be appointed and that Brownstone has not paid them over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the September ACIP meeting, several new panel members &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-acip-meeting-mmrv-hepatitis-b-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines and dismissed evidence — including the CDC’s own data — demonstrating that they are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That included Kulldorff’s questions and remarks about covid vaccines and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Pfizer clinical trial, hundreds of pregnant women were given covid vaccines or a placebo &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04754594?tab=results"&gt;during the second and third trimesters&lt;/a&gt; of pregnancy. But the birth defects &lt;a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Analysis_of_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnant_Women.pdf"&gt;Pfizer reported in its clinical study&lt;/a&gt; typically would have formed long before the vaccine was given, said Jeffrey Morris, a biostatistics and public health professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To say that this is a major safety risk,” Morris said, “is beyond a stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one really upsets me because it’s just so misleading,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17949"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39574424/"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12529215/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8427483/"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt; between covid vaccines and miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Kulldorff said: “In the randomized trial, there were four times as many birth defects in children born to mothers receiving the Pfizer covid vaccine during pregnancy compared to the placebo-receiving control group. To ensure vaccine confidence, it is the responsibility of ACIP to note and inquire about such discrepancies, and it is the manufacturer’s responsibility to thoroughly examine it through additional follow-up studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said he is “not affiliated with the Brownstone Institute” but declined to respond to additional questions, including whether he is currently compensated by the organization or has donated to it. The Brownstone Institute paid Kulldorff $108,333 in 2022, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190975-brownstone-institute-2022-990/#document/p1"&gt;tax filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levi said he heard about the Brownstone Institute from social media. He said he is in contact with Tucker “once in a while” but said Tucker has not advised him on vaccines since he was named to the CDC’s vaccine panel. Levi said he has “never received any compensation,” “never had any affiliation,” and “never donated or given any money” to the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya did not respond to questions. Williams, the NIH spokesperson, who had earlier declined to respond, citing the federal government shutdown, did not respond to a query seeking comment after the shutdown ended Nov. 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stein declined to comment and referred questions to HHS. Department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that Stein’s ACIP appointment “reflects the Administration’s commitment to independent, evidence-based science. Her professional record speaks for itself.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute’s website says &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/donate-to-brownstone-institute/"&gt;it works&lt;/a&gt; “to support writers, lawyers, scientists, economists, and other people of courage who have been professionally purged and displaced during the upheaval of our times.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a danger associated with a state-imposed orthodoxy,” Tucker said in the interview. “I think Brownstone has a moral obligation to care for dissidents and create settings in which they’re able to test their ideas against people with whom they disagree.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that “there’s never harm that comes from open debate and open distribution of information and views.” But Brownstone’s critics say its associates make extreme claims about vaccines and promote anti-vaccine messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They kind of position themselves as defending freedom, but they consistently platform covid minimizers and vaccine skeptics,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker took issue with the description, saying “it presumes that we know exactly with scientific precision the severity of covid, and so anybody who falls short of explaining that with amazing precision is a minimizer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early September, Scott testified at a Senate subcommittee hearing on vaccines alongside Toby Rogers, a political economist and Brownstone Institute fellow who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/toby-rogers/"&gt;doesn’t list&lt;/a&gt; any medical credentials. Rogers wrote last year &lt;a href="https://tobyrogers.substack.com/p/thinking-points-february-14-2024"&gt;in his Substack newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines are a civilization-destroying technology” and has promoted the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;debunked idea&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines cause autism. “My belief is that the autism and chronic disease epidemics are primarily caused by toxicants — mostly from vaccines and about a dozen additional toxicants,” &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/how-the-corruption-of-science-has-impacted-public-perception-and-policies-regarding-vaccines/"&gt;Rogers said&lt;/a&gt; at the Senate hearing. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;Numerous studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; there is no link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days later, members of Kennedy’s handpicked panel of CDC vaccine advisers “spent hours elevating these theories” about vaccines “that are not really based in solid evidence or high-quality studies,” Scott said. “They manufactured doubt about established vaccines, entertained all this speculation without any evidence — that’s the real damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levi, responding to that criticism, said: “For the first time in a long time we are issuing objective, evidence-based immunization recommendations through ACIP with honest and transparent discussion of the benefits, risks, and uncertainties.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the panel weighed whether to delay the hepatitis B shot given to most newborns, Høeg, a senior adviser for clinical sciences at the FDA, questioned whether the vaccine is safe. “We should have some humility and consider that we may not know all of the potential safety issues,” she said to the CDC panel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;Widespread evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that the hepatitis B newborn dose is safe and that the shot has very few side effects. Starting in 1991, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf"&gt;the CDC recommended&lt;/a&gt; that the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine be given to infants shortly after birth. The move virtually eliminated the potentially fatal disease among American children. Babies infected with the virus at birth have a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;90% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In academic journals, Høeg has disclosed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37744300/"&gt;receiving payment&lt;/a&gt; from the Brownstone Institute but did not specify &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38075468/"&gt;the amount&lt;/a&gt;. She has described Tucker as “&lt;a href="https://x.com/tracybethhoeg/status/1545855443578146816?s=61"&gt;a good friend&lt;/a&gt;.” Høeg did not respond to a request for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an email, the FDA’s Prasad said that he “has received no money from Brownstone or any person(s) affiliated” and that all his content published on its website “was republished from his own personal Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he has not advised Prasad or Høeg on vaccines since they became FDA officials. He described the latest CDC vaccine panel meeting as “a breath of fresh air.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Covid Contrarian Clubhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-drop-cap is-style-default"&gt;The Brownstone Institute, on its website, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220104034559/https:/brownstone.org/about/"&gt;previously called itself&lt;/a&gt; “the spiritual child of the Great Barrington Declaration,” the controversial pandemic treatise Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, and Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta co-authored in October 2020 that argued against lockdown measures to prevent the covid virus from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They proposed that widespread immunity against covid could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected, known as herd immunity, with protective measures instituted for medically vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposal was criticized at the time by many public health experts and high-ranking government officials, including then-NIH Director Francis Collins, who called its authors “fringe epidemiologists,” &lt;a href="https://aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FirstCollinsEmail.pdf"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. (Tucker was AIER &lt;a href="https://aier.org/people/jeffrey-a-tucker/"&gt;editorial director&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 to 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been willing to publish articles of some very extreme anti-vaccine people,” Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law-San Francisco focused on vaccine-related legal and policy issues, said of the Brownstone Institute. “They’re trying to give a more respectable veneer to the result of the Great Barrington Declaration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Tucker said: “I don’t think being an extremist is a good basis on which to shut somebody’s thoughts down. We need provocations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tucker said he did not propose that Bhattacharya — who was a senior scholar at the institute and &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/author/jayb/"&gt;wrote 29 articles&lt;/a&gt; from July 2021 through October 2024 — be nominated to lead the NIH. More than one-third of the articles were co-authored with Kulldorff, who became Brownstone’s senior scientific director in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff &lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/former-harvard-medical-professor-claims-he-was-fired-for-opposing-covid-lockdowns-vaccine-mandates/"&gt;told National Review&lt;/a&gt; he was fired from the Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham hospital system and placed on leave at the university that month after he refused to be vaccinated against covid, saying he had natural immunity. Kulldorff said he was &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/harvard-tramples-the-truth"&gt;hospitalized for a covid infection&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brownstone Institute reported nearly $7.4 million in contributions, grants, and other payments between 2021 and 2024, with about 35% coming from tax-exempt foundations and donor-advised funds, according to an analysis of tax filings. Donor-advised funds allow people to secure tax deductions for anonymous charitable contributions. Tucker said the organization has 17,000 donors, most of them small, but declined to elaborate on funders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The filings show the institute has also received funding from foundations run by people with backgrounds in business, including in tech, finance, law, and banking. According to a review of tax records, many of them have also given to anti-vaccine organizations; groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which promoted &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/ivermectin/"&gt;ineffective treatments&lt;/a&gt; for covid; or prominent organizations in conservative politics, such as the Federalist Society, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Heritage Foundation. Brownstone in 2023 received &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26214557-donors-trust-2023-990/?q=Brownstone&amp;amp;mode=document#document/p56"&gt;$67,350 from Donors Trust Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which funds conservative causes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, the Brownstone Institute’s board included David Stockman, a White House budget chief under President Ronald Reagan; libertarian economist Donald Boudreaux; and Roger Ver, an investor known as “&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;Bitcoin Jesus&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rogerver.com/bio/"&gt;Ver’s website&lt;/a&gt; said he gave more than $1 million to the institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Ver &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-known-bitcoin-jesus-indicted-allegedly-committing-tax-fraud-and"&gt;was indicted&lt;/a&gt; by a federal grand jury for allegedly committing tax fraud costing the IRS at least $48 million. On Oct. 14, the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/roger-ver-admits-misconduct-and-enters-deferred-prosecution-agreement"&gt;Justice Department announced&lt;/a&gt; that Ver had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve federal tax charges against him and has paid the IRS nearly $50 million. The government has moved to dismiss the indictment against him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘People Are Very Skeptical’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other than publishing posts on its website, the institute awards fellowships and convenes conferences and retreats. Its associates testify in front of Congress. And it holds a “Supper Club” series in cities throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal of Brownstone is to make possible wide-ranging conversations about the failure of the system and the solutions to it,” Tucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashley Grogg, a registered nurse and founder of Hoosiers for Medical Liberty, spoke at a Supper Club &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/event/brownstone-midwest-supper-club-aug-11th-2025-ashley-grogg/"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; on “informed decision-making,” primarily about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are very skeptical,” Grogg said in an interview. “How do we trust people moving forward? Do we really think that we can trust the new leadership that’s coming in to do the right thing?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she was connected to Brownstone through one of her members. Grogg said she does not think newborns should universally be given the hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth and opposes vaccine mandates. “I don’t want to take anything away from anybody,” but people who refuse to be vaccinated should not be “withheld from society,” Grogg said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, as the CDC’s vaccine advisers met, Tucker took to the social media platform X to amplify statements questioning vaccines, including from panel members with ties to the group he created. One was &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1968799366581223763"&gt;Malone saying&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s clear that a significant population in the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Another was from Levi, who, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1969115431345528860"&gt;referring to covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, said, “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence both on safety and efficacy for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; that mRNA and non-mRNA covid vaccines are safe for pregnant women. A mother’s vaccination while pregnant &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;also helps protect newborns&lt;/a&gt;. CDC data that drew upon medical records in 12 states found that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm?s_cid=mm7338a1_w"&gt;nearly 90% of babies&lt;/a&gt; who were hospitalized with covid had mothers who did not get the vaccine while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to questions for this article, Levi said in an email that “the claim that there is strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of covid vaccination during pregnancy in the absence of appropriate clinical trials is not consistent with fundamental regulatory principles” and that panel members “were also concerned by the potential safety signal in the single (small) clinical trial that was conducted, and other research.” Malone did not respond to questions for this article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff, the ACIP chair, said the panel will review vaccines given during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after the ACIP meeting in Atlanta, Levi gave a Brownstone Institute talk about artificial intelligence systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brownstone was a sponsor this month when Children’s Health Defense, &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/sponsors/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a leading anti-vaccine nonprofit founded by Kennedy, held its &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/sponsors/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And during the institute’s own annual conference recently in Utah, &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/brownstone-prize-winners-2025/"&gt;Bhattacharya was one of three people&lt;/a&gt; who received its first “Brownstone Prize.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would think it represents a kind of integrity and courage in public life,” Tucker said, “and stand up for what you believe is the truth, even at some degree of personal risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It does mean that it's not too late to get your flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;There is no one-to-one correlation between cold weather and getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That old adage about stepping outside and catching a cold does not tell the whole story. What does matter is that winter pushes people indoors and into closer contact, making it easier for viruses to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’s National Hospital infectious disease physician Dr. Alexandra Yonts told WTOP that this year’s flu season may arrive later than usual, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will be mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She warned flu cases could start climbing “after Christmas and New Year’s,” when people travel and families gather. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, almost 300 children died from influenza, and most of (them) were previously healthy,” Yonts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said one reason the flu shot remains essential is for protecting people with respiratory illnesses, existing health conditions or weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, the flu shot cannot give you the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In common vocabulary, we throw around the term ‘flu’ to mean any sort of viral illness that gives us a fever. But there are hosts of other viruses that are not covered by the influenza vaccine that can still make you sick,” she said. “Protecting you against influenza specifically is still a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonts added that getting vaccinated is especially important before visiting young children, elderly relatives or immunocompromised family members during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Think of it as doing it for those people, if you aren’t interested in doing it just for yourself,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re behind, Yonts said getting both the flu shot and the updated COVID booster at the same visit is completely safe: “That has been studied, and it shows there’s no major difference in the side effects. If anything, you’re getting them both out of the way at once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu shots are recommended for those 6 months old and older, and doctors say it takes about two weeks to build full immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28.

The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We developed a new single-cell sequencing technology that enabled us to directly identify and characterize EBV-infected B cells in lupus patients, and to thereby finally answer that question.” &lt;br&gt;— William Robinson, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, Robinson and his team found that in healthy individuals, there are fewer than 1 in 10,000 of EBV-infected B cells containing a dormant EBV viral genome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, in people with lupus, the number of EBV-infected B cells increased to approximately 1 in 400, which is 25 times higher. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a striking and unexpected result,” Robinson said. “It shows that people with lupus have 25-fold more EBV-infected B cells circulating in their blood than healthy individuals. Even though these cells are rare, in our paper we show that they act as overactive ‘instigators’ of the autoimmune response that mediates lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers also discovered that dormant EBV in a B cell can sometimes create the pro-inflammatory viral protein &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6327052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;EBNA2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data show that EBNA2 — a viral regulatory protein expressed in certain latency phases — can bind and activate genes that induce B cells to become pro-inflammatory and to activate broad autoimmune responses that mediate lupus,” Robinson explained. “EBV also expresses other genes that activate B cells, and these other genes may also contribute to EBV reprogramming B cells to activate the autoimmune responses that mediate lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson said that he believes these findings may lead to more treatments, and possibly a cure, for lupus in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide a mechanistic target: the rare EBV-infected ‘driver’ B cells that activate the autoimmune response that mediates lupus,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of lupus treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic strategies that eliminate these EBV-infected B cells — including next-generation B-cell depletion, engineered cellular therapies, or EBV-directed &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;immunotherapies&lt;/a&gt; — could, in principle, interrupt the root cause rather than only controlling downstream autoimmune inflammation. That makes transformative or curative therapies conceptually possible, though clinical development will take time.” &lt;br&gt;— William Robinson, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the next steps for this research, Robinson said it will include validating this mechanism in larger and longitudinal patient cohorts, and investigating exactly how EBV reprograms autoreactive B cells to mediate systemic autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(Also) determining if &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/car-t-cell-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;CAR T&lt;/a&gt; or other ultra-deep B cell depleting therapies work by depleting EBV+ driver B cells,” he added. “(And) investigating whether the mechanisms identified are active in other autoimmune diseases including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MS (multiple sclerosis)&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://raolab.bwh.harvard.edu/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Deepak Rao, MD, PHD&lt;/a&gt;, the Jonathan S.

Brenner Endowed Chair in Rheumatology and Immunology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, co-director of the Center for Cellular Profiling at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao commented that this report provides a very exciting mechanistic connection between EBV infection and the pathologic autoimmune response in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have long suspected EBV to be implicated in the development of lupus,” he explained. “This report provides an intriguing mechanism by which EBV may fuel the activation (of) the core autoimmune response in lupus.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is striking that the EBV-infected B cells in patients with lupus are so strongly enriched in one specific B cell population — the ‘age-associated B cell’ phenotype, which is a core player in the autoimmune response in lupus,” Rao continued. “The work provides an impressive demonstration that EBV-infected B cells produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9627499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;autoantibodies&lt;/a&gt;, and that these B cells can activate T cell-B cell interactions to drive production of more autoreactive B cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A link to other autoimmune diseases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work raises an interesting question — would a drug that fully suppresses EBV infection also suppress the pathologic autoimmune response in patients with lupus? Or, if we could effectively vaccinate all children against EBV infection, would this prevent the development of lupus in otherwise susceptible individuals? It will be very interesting to see if a similar pattern exists in other autoimmune diseases — do EBV-infected B cells in other autoimmune diseases, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/233747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sjogren’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, also produce disease-associated autoantibodies?”&lt;br&gt;— Deepak Rao, MD, PHD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 05:06:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQN0c3Ti1xVXpGd0hKREhWZ2s1STZUYXE1SEVENjlsbHFmVl9Uci1oNmFhOFRKSFdodENuS0RReHZINUp0S0ZCdjBibGlXYU9zdlVpSFV6VmRlUFp6blhrWWpONXVtVmp6LUxNcmMwMXI5VlRpVjN2Z3M0b1EyU3Rld3lac0lGWW5fYkttSDI4QVhDamh3ZzhhZFlXd0hGZW10QVdyOTJpNWJhZw</guid></item><item><title>大麻可以帮助您减少饮酒量吗？科学家研究“加州清醒”的工作原理- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5604813/marijuana-drinking-california-sober</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Could smoking pot lead people to drink less alcohol?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an elaborate and provocative experiment, scientists doled out joints and free drinks to see whether this idea — sometimes described as "California sober" — survived scientific scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new research offers some of the strongest data yet suggesting that smoking weed does, at least in the short term, curb how much people drink.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday — and are sure to raise questions about the merits of swapping one of these substances for another, especially given growing concern in the public health field about the popularity of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And the researchers are cautious about making any recommendations based on their findings at this point.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you," says &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jmetrik" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Metrik&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the research does bring scientists closer to understanding the link between these two substances, at a time when many people are leaning on marijuana to cut back on drinking, without waiting for the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature," says &lt;a href="https://health.yorku.ca/health-profiles/?mid=1895430" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Wardell&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at York University. "This gives us more confidence that there's a real effect here."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98340" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting high for science&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Brown study, the team took pains to replicate the real-life circumstances of getting stoned and drinking, while still maintaining a tightly-controlled study that could point toward a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;They constructed a laboratory that resembles a bar, with comfy seats and a tap, and ensured each participant had their preferred alcoholic beverage on hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink," says Metrik, who ended up spending substantial time shuttling between liquor stores looking for special vintages and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiment included three separate sessions. In one of them, participants smoked a marijuana joint with higher levels of the psychoactive compound, THC; in another they used a lower potency strain; and the last, researchers gave them a placebo with a trace amount of THC that wasn't enough to get them high.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After toking up in a designated smoking room, each participant spent the next two hours in the "bar lab" on their own where they had the opportunity to drink up to eight mini drinks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The people who smoked the higher potency cannabis ended up drinking 27% less alcohol, and the lower potency about 19% less, compared to the placebo. People who used cannabis also delayed their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is an important signal that we're detecting," says Metrik. "It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that cannabis may reduce alcohol cravings and how much people drink. But the results have been largely inconclusive, in part because the data often come from observational studies, which are less reliable and can be muddied by other factors. Animal studies have also indicated potential biological mechanisms behind weed's effect on alcohol; however, there's a question of how much this applies to humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new study also builds on what a team of researchers in Colorado &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871625003138" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in a slightly different experiment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There, participants instead picked up their marijuana from a dispensary, smoked it at home and then visited a mobile lab parked nearby, where they were offered alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The amount people ended up drinking dropped by about 25% when they were already stoned. Cravings also went down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These findings are all converging on a similar story," says &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/39978" target="_blank"&gt;Hollis Karoly&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz who led the study. But she points out there are still big questions about how much you can extrapolate from this new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98341" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Replacing one problem with another?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One obvious limitation is that how someone behaves when every sip they are taking is under close observation may not necessarily reflect what happens in a much looser, real-world social setting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And beyond that, Karoly says this pattern toward reduced alcohol consumption wasn't true for everyone in their study. In a minority of people, it actually led them to drink &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This really highlights the fact that individual differences matter," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another unanswered question centers on who's being studied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Brown trial met the criteria for "cannabis use disorder," and about 40% for alcohol use disorder. That could indicate their "drug of choice" was not necessarily alcohol in the first place, says &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rajita-sinha/" target="_blank"&gt;Rajita Sinha&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For people with problem drinking, cannabis &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a potential treatment, she says. This approach, on the other hand, "may also be promoting more cannabis use and that would be problematic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once you're in the throes of daily cannabis use, it's very hard to kick that habit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those involved in this work acknowledge the tension in this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cannabis doesn't carry the same risks of extreme harm as alcohol, which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;is a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of preventable death in the U.S and kills more than 170,000 people a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Wardell says cannabis is clearly "not a harm-free substance," either.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While research on its effect has not kept up with its surging popularity, studies have shown marijuana can impair cognition and memory, trigger a serious gastrointestinal syndrome that causes nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric illness, and impact relationships and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Wardell says this latest study doesn't actually tell us whether the negative outcomes of alcohol are worse than cannabis in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We would have to choose which one for a given individual might be less harmful and make sure that it's not inadvertently just replacing one problem with another," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her role as a clinical psychologist, Metrik at Brown has seen     some patients with severe alcoholism who successfully stopped drinking with the help of cannabis, though some have then gone on to develop issues with that drug.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In her mind, the problem right now is that many people are relying on cannabis to treat their alcohol problems, without any guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We see this all the time, and we don't know what to tell them. There's no clear messaging," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

became a tense, silent war zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is set in a classic off-campus housing situation, where a fitness-focused student lives with their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/friends/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; and his new girlfriend. The narrator is a creature of habit, a gym-goer who strictly tracks their macros, weighs their food, and consistently turns down junk food. This disciplined lifestyle, which had never been an issue before, was about to become a major point of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, the new roommate pulled the narrator aside for a serious talk. She revealed that she has an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hey-pandas-share-your-experiences-with-eating-disorders/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and that the narrator’s strict habits were triggering her desire to relapse. She then made a series of requests: that the narrator stop weighing food in front of her and generally be “less strict” with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator’s response was blunt, telling her that while they hoped she was okay, she didn’t have the right to ask them to change their entire &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, and that her ED “isn’t really their problem.” This, predictably, did not go over well. The roommate called them a jerk, and the friend in the middle has chosen the path of a conscientious objector, refusing to take sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the apartment is a cold war zone. The narrator is left wondering if they are the jerk for setting a firm boundary around their own health and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/weird-thing-you-doing-lots/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;habits&lt;/a&gt;, or if they should have compromised their lifestyle to make their roommate more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?image_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="“Am I The Jerk For Telling My Roommate It\'s Not My Problem If I Trigger Their ED?”" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?media_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9674773" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg" alt="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." title="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/couple-looking-desperate-frustrated-stressed-unhappy-annoyed-shouting-screaming_17361152.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;kues1 / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roommate’s request, while difficult, comes from a very real and painful place. As outlined by &lt;a href="https://equip.health/articles/understanding-eds/how-to-avoid-triggering-someone-with-an-eating-disorder" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Equip Health&lt;/a&gt;, specific behaviors like weighing food, strict dieting, and labeling foods as “good” or “bad” are common and powerful triggers for individuals with eating disorders. While the OP’s behaviour wasn’t intentionally triggering, it did push the wrong buttons in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a crucial difference between asking for reasonable accommodations and demanding control over another person’s life. According to Eating Disorder Specialist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/help-my-roommates-living-behaviors-are-triggering" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Kelly Flack&lt;/a&gt;, while the home should be a “safe place,” the person with the ED is ultimately responsible for their own recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasonable request might be, “Could we avoid talking about weight or calories at dinner?” An unreasonable one, which is what happened here, is demanding a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/recording-snooring-roommate/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;roommate&lt;/a&gt; fundamentally change their personal diet and stop their own health practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while the narrator’s delivery was blunt, their refusal to alter their lifestyle was a necessary boundary. As experts at The Emily Program &lt;a href="https://emilyprogram.com/blog/coping-with-triggers-in-eating-disorder-recovery/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;, a key part of eating disorder recovery is learning to develop coping skills to manage triggers, as it is impossible to eliminate them from the world entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree that the roommate needed to learn independent coping skills, or should her demands have been met?

&lt;p&gt;More than 40 experts from around the world published their research in top medical journal The Lancet, blaming UPFs for poor diets globally and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/brazilian-study-links-ultraprocessed-foods-to-early-death/a-72376669"&gt;a rise in diseases&lt;/a&gt;, from obesity to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's about the evidence we have today about … ultra-processed foods and human health," Carlos Monteiro, a lead researcher from University of Sao Paulo, said at an online briefing on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we know right now justifies global public action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Researchers blame food industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that UPFs currently represent more than half of all calories eaten in the United States, Australia and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-unhealthy-are-processed-foods/a-68276757"&gt;blamed massive corporations for changing global diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades by using aggressive marketing to sell products made with inferior ingredients and artificial methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight UPF manufacturers — Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Danone, Fomento Economico Mexicano, Mondelez, and Kraft Heinz — account for 42% of the sector's $1.5 trillion (€1.3 trillion) in assets in 2021, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The key driver of the global rise in UPFs is the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry, and its restructuring of food systems for profitability above all else," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry comprises UPF manufacturers at its core, but also a broader network of co-dependent actors who collectively drive the production, marketing and consumption of UPFs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-73457359" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="73457359" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/69695215_605.webp" data-duration="04:51"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have urged countries to introduce warnings on package labels, restrict marketing and levy taxes on certain UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The politics of food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "Ultra-processed foods" has often been met with some criticism, with some scientists calling it "too simple."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disagreement on UPFs among the scientific community has spurred an intense debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge criticisms in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series, saying more evidence is needed, but they also say the signal is already strong enough for governments to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also argued against criticism of their work on UPFs, saying efforts to "manufacture scientific doubt" on the subject were similar to tactics used by the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/tobacco/t-74329342"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; industry.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel have just discovered a way to destroy harmful 'senescent' cells that accumulate with age and ramp up the kind of tissue damage and inflammation that slowly brings life to a grinding halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"&gt;CD4 T immune cells&lt;/a&gt; transform into assassins of the damaging tissues when biological aging is detected in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new fighters, called CD4-Eomes (after the protein they produce), have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201848000"&gt;spotted before&lt;/a&gt;. However, this latest study highlights for the first time how closely they're linked to senescent cells and aging at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4-Eomes cells in modulating tissue senescence, with implications for age-related diseases and longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affectionately referred to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-cells-are-still-alive-but-can-t-function-and-they-accumulate-with-age"&gt;as zombie cells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/does-cellular-senescence-hold-secrets-healthier-aging"&gt;senescent tissues&lt;/a&gt; no longer divide into fresh new generations of cells, yet remain functional enough to churn out molecules that trigger inflammation in their local environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized units that attack senescent cells tend to be more abundant as we approach old age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907883116"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown, prompting researchers to take a closer look at the CD4-Eomes cells to see precisely what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest.jpg" alt="Mouse experiment outline" class="wp-image-182096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest-600x317.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers added CD4 T cells collected from young mice to both young and old mice. (Elyahu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the cells in mice at different ages, the researchers made two key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the switch to CD4-Eomes was triggered by the presence of senescent cells, as if the immune system detects the risk of pending inflammation and adapts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, when the mice were genetically edited to remove CD4-Eomes specializations, senescent cells became even more abundant. It's direct evidence that CD4-Eomes immune cells are keeping senescent cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed similar protective effects in chronic disease, specifically in a mouse model of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"&gt;liver cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;. Scarring was reduced and senescent cell levels dropped when the CD4-Eomes cells were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates how immune systems can adapt to combat aging over time, and that there are elements of an older immune system (specifically CD4-Eomes cells) that need to be considered in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-injections-hide-environmental-costs-we-may-not-want-to-pay"&gt;anti-aging research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People say that to reverse aging and 'rejuvenate', we need to reset their immune system like the immune systems of people in their 20s," &lt;a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/news-and-articles/bgu-scientists-one-step-closer-to-understanding-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurophysiologist Alon Monsonego, from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, our research shows that this might not be the case. So, one of the axioms of how to reduce aging may be incorrect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of scope for future research here, not least confirming that the same &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-bad-immune-cells-actually-secret-weapon-against-infection-b-silenced-redemption-lymphocytes"&gt;immune system processes&lt;/a&gt; are happening in humans as well as mice. The study team also wants to analyze how CD4-Eomes cell reactions might differ between people based on their genetics, their level of aging, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, boosting CD4-Eomes levels to increase senescent cell clearance could be an effective way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;slowing biological aging&lt;/a&gt; and reducing some of the damage caused by inflammation later in life – but that's still some way off, and won't happen until scientists have a much better understanding of these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People don't need a supercharged immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/news-and-articles/bgu-scientists-one-step-closer-to-understanding-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Monsonego. "They need one that is working properly and appropriate for their stage in life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Once the clocks have gone back and darkness falls before many of us even leave work, the rhythms of winter can feel heavier — shorter days, darker evenings, and often, later dinners. But shifting &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/chrononutrition-58033"&gt;when we eat&lt;/a&gt; during the winter could make these months a little easier on our bodies and minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies operate on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137792/"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt; – internal 24-hour clocks that regulate sleep, metabolism, digestion and hormone cycles. These rhythms are naturally synchronised with light and dark, so when daylight fades earlier, our metabolism also begins to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between metabolism and daylight may help explain why a growing body of research from the field of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17132135"&gt;chrononutrition&lt;/a&gt; suggests that when we eat may be nearly as important as what we eat. Chrononutrition examines how meal timing interacts with out internal body clock, and what affect short days might have on mood, metabolism and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-late-can-change-how-you-burn-calories-and-store-fat-depressing-study-shows"&gt;Eating Late Can Change How You Burn Calories And Store Fat, Depressing Study Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa354"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that healthy adults who ate dinner at 10pm experienced 20% higher blood sugar peaks and burned 10% less fat compared to those who ate dinner at 6pm. This was despite both groups eating identical meals and having similar bedtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broader analyses support the same trends, with a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825750"&gt;meta-analysis of 29 trials&lt;/a&gt; reporting that earlier eating windows, fewer meals and eating the bulk of one's calories earlier in the day were linked to greater weight loss and improved metabolic markers (such as better blood pressure and lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17132135"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; links consistent late-night eating – especially close to bedtime – with poorer health outcomes and a greater risk of obesity and metabolic disorders such as type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182140" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier dinners may better align with the body's natural metabolic rhythms, particularly when the last meal occurs well before the body enters its "rest" phase. This might explain why eating earlier has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many chronobiologists conclude that aligning &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18231/j.ijnmhs.2024.019"&gt;food intake with circadian biology&lt;/a&gt; represents a promising, low-cost method of improving metabolic outcomes – especially when combined with other lifestyle factors such as physical activity and &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/safe2eat/your-nutrition-needs"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eating with intent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In winter, especially in northern latitudes, shorter days and longer nights can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/29.1.25"&gt;disrupt circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced sunlight can lower serotonin levels, contributing to low mood or &lt;a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/985"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt; (SAD). When paired with longer evenings indoors, it's common for people to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01451"&gt;snack more often or delay eating dinner&lt;/a&gt; until later at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But digestion, hormone release (including those that help with sleep and digestion) and even the amount of calories you burn throughout the day all follow circadian rhythms. When meals are pushed too close to sleep, these processes overlap in ways that can affect both metabolism and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.20463/pan.2025.0003"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; – potentially increasing risks of poor sleep and metabolic ill health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182145" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-642x361.jpg" alt="This Is What Time You Should Eat Dinner During Winter" class="wp-image-182145 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182145" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Try not to eat dinner too close to bedtime. (Iuliia Isaieva/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While light and dark have the biggest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms"&gt;influence on circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, food intake, stress, physical activity and temperature also affect them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, should you eat dinner earlier in winter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, yes — at least a little earlier. There are three main reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first has to do with metabolic alignment. Eating when your metabolism is still active supports better &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep5030034"&gt;blood sugar control, energy use and fat burning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second has to do with digestion. Leaving a few hours between dinner and bedtime allows digestion to wind down before sleep, which may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308172"&gt;improve sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third reason has to do with supporting mood and circadian rhythms. A &lt;a href="https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/efd2.70092"&gt;consistent eating window and earlier dinner&lt;/a&gt; can help anchor daily routines – especially helpful when other time cues (such as daylight) are weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the caveat: this isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Many different factors – such as how active you are, if you have any chronic conditions and your schedule – need to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elite athlete training in the evening may need a later meal to support performance and recovery. But someone less active might benefit more from an earlier, lighter dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825750"&gt;rather than rigid rules&lt;/a&gt;, think of meal timing as a flexible tool in your nutrition toolkit. The real focus should be on eating with intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-time-of-day-you-eat-in-later-life-could-foreshadow-an-early-death"&gt;The Time of Day You Eat in Later Life Could Foreshadow an Early Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means taking into account your goals (such as whether you want to lose weight or boost athletic performance), how often you exercise, how close to bedtime you normally eat, how you feel depending on the time of day you eat dinner and what's realistic given your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're eating after 9pm most nights and waking up sluggish or find sleep less restful, experimenting with earlier meals may be worthwhile. But if you're training late or eating socially, that's fine too — focus on quality over timing, choosing lighter, balanced meals and allowing at least two to three hours before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other mealtime tips you can try during the darker months include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finishing dinner earlier, ideally between 5.30pm–7.00pm, or at least two to three hours before bedtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front loading your calories by making breakfast and lunch more substantial while there's more daylight and your metabolism is more active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;planning around activity, so if you exercise late, have your main meal earlier and a small recovery snack afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping a consistent eating window, finishing eating by around 8pm most nights to support circadian alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflecting and adjusting by noting how meal timing affects your energy, sleep quality and mood for a week or two then changing as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staying flexible by remembering perfection isn't required – a regular schedule and awareness of what you need is what counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter settles in, paying attention to when you eat may be just as important as what you eat. Aligning mealtimes with your body's natural rhythms can help steady energy, mood and sleep through the darker months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real key is intentionality: making choices that serve your health, not rigid rules that create stress. The healthiest rhythm is the one that harmonises with both your biology and your lifestyle.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269559/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage medium-level anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of anxiety like a volume knob,” Dr Warrier explains. “It can be at a low level, where it’s almost like a whisper. It can be at a medium level, where you know it’s there. Or it can be at a very high level, where it’s screaming.” For low-level &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, simple techniques like deep breathing or stretching can help. “Even basic practices such as box breathing or slow exhalation can calm your nervous system. In a way, it’s telling your body that you are safe,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When anxiety rises to a medium level, manifesting as restlessness or feeling on edge, Dr Warrier recommends grounding techniques. “Connect with your body’s sensory system. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can taste, and one thing you can smell.&lt;/span&gt; This brings you back to your body and helps you calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other strategies for medium-level anxiety include a quick body scan to check in with each part of your body or taking a walk. “The rhythmic action of walking can also help calm your nervous system,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do during high-level anxiety or panic attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-level anxiety, such as during a panic attack or overwhelming stress, requires a more immediate intervention. “This is where you need a slight shock to reset your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-warns-hands-shaking-slurred-speech-are-signs-of-nervous-system-disorders-5-symptoms-you-should-not-ignore-101761714665596.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="nervous system"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, either by splashing cold water on your face or keeping an ice cube in your mouth. Cold water activates the mammalian dive reflex, which brings down your heart rate, stimulates the vagus nerve, and calms you down,” explains Dr Warrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the intensity of anxiety and using the right technique for each level, it becomes easier to regain control and calm the nervous system. As Dr Warrier notes, “Different levels of anxiety need different tools. The key is to match your response to your body’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

That possibility is inching closer to reality thanks to breakthroughs in regenerative dentistry. In April this year, a team at King’s College London (KCL), in collaboration with Imperial College London, announced that they had engineered a biomaterial scaffold that allows cells to communicate and form tooth-like structures in vitro — a key step toward lab-grown human teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ana Angelova Volponi, director of regenerative dentistry at KCL, said the research could “revolutionise dental care”. The study also notes that while some animals such as sharks and elephants can grow new teeth throughout their lives, humans get only one adult set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Essential dental tips for healthier teeth and gums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if you lose a permanent tooth — whether from decay, trauma or congenital absence — treatment typically involves implants, bridges or dentures. While effective, these rely on synthetic materials, surgical intervention, and often require long-term maintenance. The KCL researchers emphasise that a biologically grown tooth would integrate naturally into the jawbone, with nerves and ligaments intact, behaving like a real tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could reduce the long-term risks of wear, failure, or rejection that come with artificial replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reason To Smile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough lies not in producing a fully-grown tooth yet, but in creating the right laboratory environment for tooth-forming cells to do their work. In earlier experiments, cells placed into scaffolds failed to organise properly because developmental signals arrived all at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, according to ScienceAlert, uses a hydrogel scaffold — a water-rich polymer — that releases signals gradually, mimicking the natural “matrix” in which teeth form. Within this structure, epithelial and mesenchymal cells (derived from mouse embryos for now) were able to interact and begin the early stages of tooth formation. As The Independent reports, scientists are exploring two possible pathways toward clinical use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Transplanting immature tooth-forming cells — a “tooth bud” — into the empty socket and letting it grow naturally; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Growing a full tooth in the lab, then implanting it surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each approach has trade-offs: in-mouth growth could minimise surgery, while lab-grown teeth offer greater control. It’s too early to say which will prove more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What The Advantage Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional fillings and implants come with drawbacks. Fillings can weaken surrounding tooth structures, while implants require drilling and bone anchoring — with risks of rejection, bone loss or limited lifespan. A lab-grown biological tooth, derived from the patient’s own cells, would integrate organically with bone and ligament, potentially remodeling and repairing itself like a natural tooth. Still, the technology isn’t ready for patients. Much of the work remains pre-clinical, using animal or mixed human-mouse models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest KCL study relied on mouse embryo-derived progenitor cells to test the hydrogel scaffold, not yet fully human adult cells, ScienceAlert notes. Experts also point out that engineered teeth currently lack full maturation — they don’t yet have a complete blood-vessel network, nerve supply or fully developed enamel and roots. Elsewhere, researchers in Japan are running early clinical trials of treatments that stimulate natural tooth regrowth in patients born without certain teeth — a different, but complementary, line of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Challenges ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several technical, clinical and ethical hurdles remain. Scientists still need to figure out how a lab-grown tooth could integrate seamlessly with nerves, blood vessels, periodontal ligaments and bone to function like a real one. To avoid rejection, each tooth ideally needs to be grown from the patient’s own cells — a process difficult to scale. And even if perfected, the path from lab to clinic involves years of trials, approvals, manufacturing protocols and cost testing before dentists can routinely offer regrown teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;A Broader Dental Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, tooth regeneration could transform dentistry itself. The field would shift from repairing damage with synthetic materials to restoring natural biology, focusing on prevention and regeneration. Someday, “just grow a new tooth” could replace “book a filling” as a standard line in dental care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though timelines are uncertain, researchers are cautiously optimistic. Some predict that within the next decade, the technology could reach early human trials, starting with simpler, single-tooth cases before expanding to more complex restorations.

plague. The same disease that wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century has never been eradicated. It's caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is spread to animals by fleas. A handful of cases are reported in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease spread to the U.S. in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early 1900s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt; likely via an infected rodent on a steamship.

If untreated, the infection can spread to the lungs (pneumonic) or the whole body (septicemic), which is almost always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking, and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present," warned Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County acting director of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is a plague case concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The plague is &lt;a href="https://netec.org/2024/03/25/climate-change-and-infectious-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a vector-borne disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a vector-borne disease&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is transmitted to humans via the bites of infected vectors such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. As the heat-trapping pollution produced by human activity causes global temperatures to rise, it creates the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A warmer planet means longer breeding seasons for vectors and extends their ranges. For example, infections of dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, are skyrocketing across Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the plague?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, doctors are adept at treating the plague, provided it is caught quickly enough. A round of antibiotics administered early on will cure the infection, so it's important to help &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/talk-climate-with-your-family-and-friends/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread awareness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spread awareness&lt;/a&gt; of the warning signs.

For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world’s leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A systematic review of 104 long-term studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conducted for the series&lt;/a&gt; found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his colleagues in Brazil came up with the Nova classification system for foods. It groups them by level of processing, ranging from one – unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables – to four: ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This category is made up of products that have been industrially manufactured, often using artificial flavours, emulsifiers and colouring. They include soft drinks and packaged snacks, and tend to be extremely palatable and high in calories but low in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also designed and marketed to displace fresh food and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits, Monteiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics argue UPF is an ill-defined category and existing health policies, such as those aimed at reducing sugar and salt consumption, are sufficient to deal with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Monteiro and his co-authors acknowledged valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPF – such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, they argued future research must not delay immediate action to tackle the scourge of UPF, which they say is justified by the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” Monteiro warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/uk-government-drops-healthy-eating-push-after-lobbying-by-ultra-processed-food-firms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive marketing and political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second paper in the series proposes policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing and consumption. Although some countries have brought in rules to reformulate foods and control UPF, “the global public health response is still nascent, akin to where the tobacco control movement was decades ago”, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The third paper says that global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPF. UPF is a leading cause of the “chronic disease pandemic” linked to diet, with food companies putting profit above all else, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The main barrier to protecting health is “corporate political activities, coordinated transnationally through a global network of front groups, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research partners, to counter opposition and block regulation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Series co-author Prof Barry Popkin, from the University of North Carolina, said: “We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also proposed stronger marketing restrictions, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/22/uk-ban-on-junk-food-adverts-targeting-children-is-delayed-until-next-year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adverts aimed at children, as well as banning UPF in public places such as schools&lt;/a&gt; and hospitals and putting limits on UPF sales and shelf space in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One success story is Brazil’s national school food programme, which has eliminated most UPF and will require 90% of food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists not involved in the series broadly welcomed the review of evidence but also called for more research into UPF, cautioning that association with health harm may not mean causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQYTY2WWw2Yi00SlJfSllFS09FajVTSGpDX29pMDlQd2JCMy1pMXpiQ2J0NnFuVzZfNE5FcW81WlU3M3JtYUpaWW9ram1ub0RjNy1kNloxU1JJOG9jSy1XRXNLWGNjMURBa3l2S1BkdXRUeXVGOEZQdU4wZDVLU05OYXFqaFpkRGVKT0laUDczRmEzRWxoY0E1NzhDZW5BODQwWEd5S1JSYl90UEwwWkQ2dUlUazUzVEFXWFVvSmFPdw</guid></item><item><title>维生素D过量如何导致肾脏损伤：需要注意的6个症状-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-vitamin-d-overdose-leads-to-kidney-damage-6-symptoms-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/125418369.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and immune function by helping the body effectively absorb calcium. However, the recent surge in supplement use has amplified the risk of overdosing (hypervitaminosis D), often occurring when people take high doses without medical oversight. The primary danger lies in the resulting hypercalcaemia, excessive calcium in the blood. The kidneys are forced to filter this overload, causing calcium to deposit in their tissues, a condition known as nephrocalcinosis. This prolonged strain can severely damage the filtering units, leading to acute kidney injury or irreversible failure. Recognising the subtle warning signs is vital, as early symptoms like nausea, persistent thirst, and frequent urination signal a critical electrolyte imbalance and escalating risk to renal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vitamin D overdose affects the kidneys&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive vitamin D intake forces the kidneys to filter high amounts of calcium over prolonged periods. This can cause calcium to deposit in the kidney tissue, gradually forming kidney stones or permanent calcium deposits, a condition called nephrocalcinosis. Over time, this overload may damage the kidneys’ filtering units, resulting in acute kidney injury or, in severe cases, irreversible kidney failure. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206014/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a case study documented in the Journal of Renal Injury Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin D intoxication (overdose) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury and can result not only from self-administration but also from dispensing or prescribing errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Chronic hypercalcemia can also affect other organs, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications and disturbances in electrolyte balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common symptoms of vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting: Excess vitamin D raises calcium levels in the blood, which can irritate the stomach and digestive tract. This often leads to persistent nausea and episodes of vomiting, which are among the earliest signs of overdose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent thirst and frequent urination: High vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), forcing the kidneys to work harder to remove it. This results in frequent urination and intense thirst as the body tries to maintain fluid balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness and fatigue: Elevated calcium levels affect muscle function, leading to general weakness and fatigue. Even routine activities may feel more exhausting, and muscles may feel sore or unusually tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion and cognitive issues: Excess vitamin D can impact the nervous system, causing symptoms like confusion, poor concentration, or disorientation. These cognitive effects may be subtle at first but can worsen if the overdose continues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower back or side pain: Pain in the lower back or sides may indicate that the kidneys are under stress. High calcium levels can cause kidney stones or impair kidney function, resulting in discomfort in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling in the legs and difficulty breathing: In severe cases, prolonged vitamin D overdose can cause kidney damage, leading to fluid retention. This may present as swelling in the legs and ankles, as well as shortness of breath due to fluid buildup, which are serious warning signs of potential kidney failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do adults need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, most adults require only a small amount of vitamin D daily, typically ranging from 400 to 1,000 international units (IU). Regular intake above 4,000 IU can push levels into a potentially harmful range, especially when extremely high doses of 8,000–12,000 IU are taken consistently over months or years. Another common cause of overdose is the accidental daily consumption of high-dose vitamin D capsules that are intended for weekly use, such as 60,000 IU capsules. Excess vitamin D leads to the accumulation of calcium in the blood, a condition known as hypercalcaemia. This excess calcium must be filtered through the kidneys, which can strain their delicate structures and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdose usually occurs when supplements are taken without proper medical guidance, when multiple products containing vitamin D are used simultaneously, or when high-dose injections are administered without regulation. To avoid complications, vitamin D should be taken only if recommended by a healthcare professional. It is important not to exceed prescribed doses, even if higher amounts seem beneficial. Individuals taking long-term supplements should also undergo periodic blood tests to monitor vitamin D and calcium levels. This helps ensure the body is receiving an adequate but safe amount, minimising the risk of kidney damage and other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is undeniably important for health, but more is not always better. Careful use under medical supervision ensures the benefits of supplementation while preventing potential harm. Proper guidance, regular monitoring, and awareness of the symptoms of overdose can protect the kidneys and other organs from the adverse effects of excessive vitamin D. By following these precautions, individuals can safely support bone strength, immunity, and overall well-being without risking long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Meanwhile, the United States has had more than 1,720 confirmed cases this year, more than in any year in the past three decades.

Countries and regions come and go from the measles-free list frequently. “Elimination is a fragile state,” says William Moss, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas became the first — and, so far, only — World Health Organization (WHO) region to be declared measles-free, in 2016, but this status didn’t last long, thanks to an outbreak in Venezuela in 2018 that spread to Brazil. The region clawed back its status in 2024, but has now lost it again, thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;10 November decision about Canada, made by the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends that countries vaccinate 95% of children with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Few countries hit that mark: in the European Union in 2023, for example, only four countries achieved it. “That’s an aspirational goal. A country can eliminate measles without 95% coverage,” notes Moss; outbreaks tend to happen in communities in which the coverage is much lower than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the rate of measles vaccination with one dose — which provides some protection — has hovered between 81% and 86% for more than a decade, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03334-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03334-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;is currently recovering from a dip that occurred during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02469-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02469-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;disruptions in vaccine delivery&lt;/a&gt; (see ‘Widespread protection’).

stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201694" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3 in 2,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are born with auditory impairments. The good news is that popping a Viagra could come with a surprising perk beyond the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/192090" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a mutation in a gene called CPD, which results in a form of deafness known as sensorineural hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Chicago, the University of Miami and several institutions in Turkey uncovered that the condition could be targeted by two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One is a common supplement, while the other is the popular erectile dysfunction drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study is exciting because we found a new gene mutation that’s linked to deafness, and more importantly, we have a therapeutic target that can actually mitigate this condition,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://neurology.uchicago.edu/faculty/rong-zhai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rong Grace Zhai&lt;/a&gt;, a neurological diseases professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One treatment was sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra and other&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" rel="nofollow" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt; ED medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In healthy hearing, the CPD gene instructs an enzyme to maintain levels of the amino acid arginine, which produces nitric oxide, helping send signals through the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the CPD gene pathway is disrupted, causing oxidative stress and cell death in the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear hair cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for hearing and balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the ear loses the function of the CPD gene, the ability to detect sound waves goes too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors addressed this loss in two ways using fruit flies with CPD mutations: sildenafil to stimulate nitric oxide production and a separate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/vitamin-supplements-could-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-doctor/"&gt;arginine supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Both treatments improved hearing loss in the flies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that CPD maintains the level of arginine in the hair cells to allow a quick signaling cascade by generating nitric oxide,” Zhai explained. “These hair cells in particular are more sensitive or vulnerable to the loss of CPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids and cochlear implants, though the initial study results may lead to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found a promising therapeutic avenue for these patients,” said Zhai. “It is a good example of our efforts to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for treating rare diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unsurprising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 9171 subtype “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” David Sugerman, who leads the CDC measles response, said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, local health officials are pessimistic that they’ll be able to stamp out the virus’ spread, saying that vaccination efforts have had “limited” impact. As Ars reported previously, vaccination rates are dangerously low in two measles hotspots: northwestern Mohave County, Arizona, and the southwest health district of Utah. Vaccination rates among kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year were 78.4 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively. That’s well below the 95 percent target needed to keep the virus from spreading onward in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, public health officials in Arizona and Utah have reported barriers to responding to the outbreak. Around a quarter of cases don’t know how they were exposed, suggesting cases and exposures are being missed. In late October, health officials in Salt Lake County, Utah, said that a person likely infected with measles &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/"&gt;refused to cooperate&lt;/a&gt; with their investigation, leaving them unable to confirm the probable case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review, told the Times, “It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the CDC  has tallied 1,723 measles cases across 42 states. Most (87 percent) of those cases were linked to outbreaks, of which there have been 45 this year. For context, there were 16 outbreaks and a total of 285 measles cases in the US last year. This year’s measles cases mark a 33-year high.&lt;/p&gt;

Antibody tests frequently produce false-negative results, and the characteristic bullseye rash occurs in only about 25% of patients. Plus, many patients develop skin lesions that resemble those of other illnesses. These factors can complicate and delay accurate diagnosis (the patient whose case was the inspiration for developing the new test waited four years.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lyme disease has been on the rise in the United States over the past 30 years, which underscores the need for faster, more accurate testing. Left untreated, infection can lead to heart, joint, and nervous system problems and produce symptoms that can impair quality of life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain, cognitive difficulties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a separate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/14/25-0459_article"&gt;&lt;span&gt;matched cohort study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team of researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties occurred 5% more frequently among people with Lyme disease than those with other conditions such as COVID-19. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the study, the researchers looked at insurance claims data from 2017 to 2021 in regions where Lyme disease is common. They identified 24,503 patients with Lyme disease and 122,095 patients with other diagnoses (control group). They also compared the relative frequencies of diagnosis codes for pain, fatigue, and cognitive problems in the two groups in the year after diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those symptom codes occurred 5.0% more often among case-patients than among controls and made up 11.0% of all symptom codes among Lyme patients. Except for fatigue, symptom-code frequency among patients with Lyme disease decreased significantly in the six to 12 months after diagnosis and reached levels similar to those of controls by year's end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team's findings are consistent with those of previous clinical studies that show "similar persisting symptoms of unclear pathogenesis among a subset of persons who received diagnosis and treatment," write the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key example researchers found pertained to two beneficial bacterial species, which survived in a test tube when exposed to the antifungal drug bifonazole. The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has uncovered microscopic abnormalities in the blood of long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients&lt;/strong&gt; that may help explain the condition’s lingering symptoms. These hidden structures, discovered through advanced imaging techniques, show a significant departure from typical blood composition. The findings could reshape how we understand and diagnose long COVID. And if confirmed, they might finally provide a tangible target for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microclots And Immune Webs: Unseen Triggers Behind Lingering Illness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the hunt for what fuels &lt;strong&gt;long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;—a condition that continues to puzzle scientists years after the pandemic began—a team of international researchers has turned its attention to the blood. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reveal that people suffering from long COVID consistently show an unusually high presence of two little-known but potentially harmful agents: &lt;em&gt;microclots&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neutrophil extracellular traps&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;NETs&lt;/em&gt;. These substances, although naturally occurring, appear to become harmful when they accumulate and interact in excessive or abnormal ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are not the types of blood clots you’d see in a stroke or pulmonary embolism,” explains Dr. Alain Thierry, lead author of the study and a geneticist at &lt;strong&gt;Montpellier University&lt;/strong&gt; in France. Instead, they are much smaller—microscopic in fact—yet significant enough to disrupt blood flow in tiny vessels, particularly in areas like the brain, muscles, and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used &lt;strong&gt;imaging flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy&lt;/strong&gt; on blood samples from 50 long COVID patients and 38 healthy individuals. They found that microclots were nearly 20 times more abundant in those with long COVID—and, more surprisingly, that NETs were not just floating freely, but were physically embedded within the microclots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They propose that this entanglement of NETs and clots forms structures that are resistant to the body’s natural blood-clearing processes, a disruption that could directly explain symptoms such as &lt;em&gt;brain fog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;chronic pain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Journal of Medical Virology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When The Immune System Traps Itself: How The Body’s Defenses May Turn Against It&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NETs are normally part of the immune system’s frontline defense. These sticky webs of DNA and enzymes, released by white blood cells, trap invading pathogens before they can spread. In typical cases, NETs are quickly dissolved after doing their job. But in long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients,&lt;/strong&gt; researchers found that NETs lingered in large quantities, intertwining with microclots and potentially amplifying the damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology,” the authors write, “but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both microclots and NETs had been previously observed separately in other diseases, their &lt;strong&gt;combined presence and physical interaction&lt;/strong&gt; in long COVID patients marks a striking new insight. This synergy may explain why some people develop persistent symptoms long after the infection has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic,” says Thierry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; In other words, the body’s own immune response may be creating self-sustaining, harmful blood structures that prolong illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also help explain why standard diagnostic tests often fail to detect long COVID—these interactions happen at a microscopic level and wouldn’t necessarily show up on conventional scans or blood work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward A Blood-Based Test? AI Models See The Invisible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more remarkable aspects of the study was the use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/asian-militaries-and-artificial-intelligence/" data-type="post" data-id="42190"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to analyze anonymized blood samples. The AI was able to correctly identify long COVID patients with 91% accuracy based solely on the presence and patterns of microclots and NETs. This raises the possibility of developing a reliable &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic blood test&lt;/strong&gt; for a condition that has, until now, largely been diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could transform how doctors screen for and manage long COVID, and even open the door to personalized treatments aimed at breaking down these resistant structures in the blood. Clinical applications are still a long way off, but this research offers a promising roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the authors caution that more research is needed to prove causation—not just correlation—the patterns they uncovered mark a significant leap forward. If confirmed by future studies, the blood of long COVID patients may hold the key not only to diagnosis but to treatment strategies that could finally bring relief to millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
