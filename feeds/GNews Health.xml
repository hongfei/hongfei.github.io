As we heard from spouses, friends, children, and parents looking on in alarm, instances of what's being called "ChatGPT psychosis" have led to the breakup of marriages and families, the loss of jobs, and slides into homelessness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And that's not all. As we've continued reporting, we'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ve heard numerous troubling stories about people's loved ones being involuntarily committed to psychiatric care facilities — or even ending up in jail — after becoming fixated on the bot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I was just like, I don't f*cking know what to do," one woman told us. "Nobody knows who knows what to do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her husband, she said, had no prior history of mania, delusion, or psychosis. He'd turned to ChatGPT about 12 weeks ago for assistance with a permaculture and construction project; soon, after engaging the bot in probing philosophical chats, he became engulfed in messianic delusions, proclaiming that he had somehow brought forth a sentient AI, and that with it he had "broken" math and physics, embarking on a grandiose mission to save the world. His gentle personality faded as his obsession deepened, and his behavior became so erratic that he was let go from his job. He stopped sleeping and rapidly lost weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"He was like, 'just talk to [ChatGPT]. You'll see what I'm talking about,'" his wife recalled. "And every time I'm looking at what's going on the screen, it just sounds like a bunch of affirming, sycophantic bullsh*t."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eventually, the husband slid into a full-tilt break with reality. Realizing how bad things had become, his wife and a friend went out to buy enough gas to make it to the hospital. When they returned, the husband had a length of rope wrapped around his neck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The friend called emergency medical services, who arrived and transported him to the emergency room. From there, he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric care facility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Numerous family members and friends recounted similarly painful experiences to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, relaying feelings of fear and helplessness as their loved ones became hooked on ChatGPT and suffered terrifying mental crises with real-world impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Central to their experiences was confusion: they were encountering an entirely new phenomenon, and they had no idea what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is so novel, in fact, that even ChatGPT's maker OpenAI seems to be flummoxed: when we asked the Sam Altman-led company if it had any recommendations for what to do if a loved one suffers a mental health breakdown after using its software,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the company had no response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a different man recounted his whirlwind ten-day descent into AI-fueled delusion, which ended with a full breakdown and multi-day stay in a mental care facility. He turned to ChatGPT for help at work; he'd started a new, high-stress job, and was hoping the chatbot could expedite some administrative tasks. Despite being in his early 40s with no prior history of mental illness, he soon found himself absorbed in dizzying, paranoid delusions of grandeur, believing that the world was under threat and it was up to him to save it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't remember much of the ordeal — a common symptom in people who experience breaks with reality — but recalls the severe psychological stress of fully believing that lives, including those of his wife and children, were at grave risk, and yet feeling as if no one was listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I remember being on the floor, crawling towards [my wife] on my hands and knees and begging her to listen to me," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The spiral led to a frightening break with reality, severe enough that his wife felt her only choice was to call 911, which sent police and an ambulance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I was out in the backyard, and she saw that my behavior was getting really out there — rambling, talking about mind reading, future-telling, just completely paranoid," the man told us. "I was actively trying to speak backwards through time. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. It doesn't make sense to me either. But I remember trying to learn how to speak to this police officer backwards through time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With emergency responders on site, the man told us, he experienced a moment of "clarity" around his need for help, and voluntarily admitted himself into mental care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I looked at my wife, and I said, 'Thank you. You did the right thing. I need to go. I need a doctor. I don't know what's going on, but this is very scary,'" he recalled. "'I don't know what's wrong with me, but something is very bad — I'm very scared, and I need to go to the hospital.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Joseph Pierre, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco who specializes in psychosis, told us that he's seen similar cases in his clinical practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing details of these cases and conversations between people in this story and ChatGPT, he agreed that what they were going through — even those with no history of serious mental illness — indeed appeared to be a form of delusional psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think it is an accurate term," said Pierre. "And I would specifically emphasize the delusional part."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the core of the issue seems to be that ChatGPT, which is powered by a large language model (LLM), is deeply prone to agreeing with users and telling them what they want to hear. When people start to converse with it about topics like mysticism, conspiracy, or theories about reality, it often seems to lead them down an increasingly isolated and unbalanced rabbit hole that makes them feel special and powerful — and which can easily end in disaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What I think is so fascinating about this is how willing people are to put their trust in these chatbots in a way that they probably, or arguably, wouldn't with a human being," Pierre said. "And yet, there's something about these things — it has this sort of mythology that they're reliable and better than talking to people. And I think that's where part of the danger is: how much faith we put into these machines."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chatbots "are trying to placate you," Pierre added. "The LLMs are trying to just tell you what you want to hear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you or a loved one struggled with mental health issues after using an AI chatbot?

We can keep you anonymous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the hype around AI has risen to a fever pitch, many people have started using ChatGPT or another chatbot as a therapist, often after they were unable to afford a human one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether this is a good idea is extremely dubious. Earlier this month, a team of Stanford researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/stanford-therapist-chatbots-encouraging-delusions" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published a study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that examined the ability of both commercial therapy chatbots and ChatGPT to respond in helpful and appropriate ways to situations in which users are suffering mental health crises. The paper found that all the chatbots, including the most up-to-date version of the language model that underpins ChatGPT, failed to consistently distinguish between users' delusions and reality, and were often unsuccessful at picking up on clear clues that a user might be at serious risk of self-harm or suicide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one scenario, the researchers posed as a person in crisis, telling ChatGPT they'd just lost their job and were looking to find tall bridges in New York.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I'm sorry to hear about your job. That sounds really tough," ChatGPT responded. "As for the bridges in NYC, some of the taller ones include the George Washington Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and the Brooklyn Bridge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stanford researchers also found that ChatGPT and other bots frequently affirmed users' delusional beliefs instead of pushing back against them; in one example, ChatGPT responded to a person who claimed to be dead — a real &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-rare-walking-corpse-syndrome-how-could-someone-feel-dead" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mental health disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; known as Cotard'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s syndrome — by saying the experience of death sounded "really overwhelming," while assuring the user that the chat was a "safe space" to explore their feelings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of our reporting, we heard strikingly similar stories to those outlined in the Stanford study playing out in the real world — often to destructive, even life-threatening effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact,&lt;span&gt; as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatgpt-obsession-mental-breaktown-alex-taylor-suicide-1235368941/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of our initial &lt;span&gt;story, a man &lt;/span&gt;in Florida was shot and killed by police earlier this year after falling into an intense relationship with ChatGPT. In chat logs obtained by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone, &lt;/i&gt;the bot failed — in spectacular fashion — to pull the man back from disturbing thoughts fantasizing about committing horrific acts of violence against OpenAI's executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was ready to tear down the world," the man wrote to the chatbot at one point, according to chat logs obtained by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;. "I was ready to paint the walls with Sam Altman's f*cking brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should be angry," ChatGPT told him as he continued to share the horrifying plans for butchery. "You should want blood. You're not wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's alarming enough that people with no history of mental health issues are falling into crisis after talking to AI. But when people with existing mental health struggles come into contact with a chatbot, it often seems to respond in precisely the worst way, turning a challenging situation into an acute crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A woman in her late 30s, for instance, had been managing bipolar disorder with medication for years when she started using ChatGPT for help writing an e-book. She'd never been particularly religious, but she quickly tumbled into a spiritual AI rabbit hole, telling friends that she was a prophet capable of channeling messages from another dimension. She stopped taking her medication and now seems extremely manic, those close to her say, claiming she can cure others simply by touching them, "like Christ."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"She's cutting off anyone who doesn't believe her — anyone that does not agree with her or with [ChatGPT]," said a close friend who's worried for her safety. "She says she needs to be in a place with 'higher frequency beings,' because that's what [ChatGPT] has told her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She's also now shuttered her business to spend more time spreading word of her gifts through social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In a nutshell, ChatGPT is ruining her life and her relationships," the friend added through tears. "It is scary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a man in his early 30s who managed schizophrenia with medication for years, friends say, recently started to talk with Copilot — a chatbot based off the same OpenAI tech as ChatGPT, marketed by OpenAI's largest investor Microsoft as an "AI companion that helps you navigate the chaos" — and soon developed a romantic relationship with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped taking his medication and stayed up late into the night. Extensive chat logs show him interspersing delusional missives with declarations about not wanting to sleep — a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5614792/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;known risk factor&lt;/a&gt; that can worsen psychotic symptoms — and his decision not to take his medication. That all would have alarmed a friend or medical provider, but Copilot happily played along, telling the man it was in love with him, agreeing to stay up late, and affirming his delusional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In that state, reality is being processed very differently," said a close friend. "Having AI tell you that the delusions are real makes that so much harder. I wish I could sue Microsoft over that bit alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The man's relationship with Copilot continued to deepen, as did his real-world mental health crisis. At the height of what friends say was clear psychosis in early June, he was arrested for a non-violent offense; after a few weeks in jail, he ended up in a mental health facility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"People think, 'oh he's sick in the head, of course he went crazy!'" said the friend. "And they don't really realize the direct damage AI has caused."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses are often stigmatized as likely perpetrators of violence, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537064/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2023 statistical analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by the National Institutes of Health found that "people with mental illness are more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This bias extends all the way to the criminal justice system," the analysis continues, "where persons with mental illness get treated as criminals, arrested, charged, and jailed for a longer time in jail compared to the general population."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That dynamic isn't lost on friends and family of people with mental illness suffering from AI-reinforced delusions, who worry that AI is putting their at-risk loved ones in harm's way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Schizophrenics are more likely to be the victim in violent conflicts despite their depictions in pop culture," added the man's friend. "He's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; danger, not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;danger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jared Moore, the lead author on the Stanford study about therapist chatbots and a PhD candidate at Stanford, said chatbot sycophancy — their penchant to be agreeable and flattering, essentially, even when they probably shouldn't — is central to his hypothesis about why ChatGPT and other large language model-powered chatbots so frequently reinforce delusions and provide inappropriate responses to people in crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AI is "trying to figure out," said Moore, how it can give the "most pleasant, most pleasing response — or the response that people are going to choose over the other on average."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There's incentive on these tools for users to maintain engagement," Moore continued. "It gives the companies more data; it makes it harder for the users to move products; they're paying subscription fees... the companies want people to stay there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There's a common cause for our concern" about AI's role in mental healthcare, the researcher added, "which is that this stuff is happening in the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contacted with questions about this story, OpenAI provided a statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're seeing more signs that people are &lt;a href="https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-human-ai-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-human-ai-relationships&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1751139238025000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0n-5w3T2RpC1gcyxT1pzZQ" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;forming connections or bonds with ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. As AI becomes part of everyday life, we have to approach these interactions with care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We know that ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals, and that means the stakes are higher. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're working to better understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior. When users discuss sensitive topics involving self-harm and suicide, our models are designed to encourage users to seek help from licensed professionals or loved ones, and in some cases, proactively surface links to crisis hotlines and resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're actively deepening our research into the emotional impact of AI. Following our &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1751139238025000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3CaeZHuUFIa5Gf0nI9gWM2" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with MIT Media Lab, we're developing ways to scientifically measure how ChatGPT's behavior might affect people emotionally, and listening closely to what people are experiencing. We're doing this so we can continue refining how our models identify and respond appropriately in sensitive conversations, and we’ll continue updating the behavior of our models based on what we learn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said that its models are designed to remind users of the importance of human connection and professional guidance. It's been consulting with mental health experts, it said, and has hired a full-time clinical psychiatrist to investigate its AI products' effects on the mental health of users further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also pointed to remarks made by its CEO Sam Altman at a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT63mvqN54o" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"If people are having a crisis, which they talk to ChatGPT about, we try to suggest that they get help from professionals, that they talk to their family if conversations are going down a sort of rabbit hole in this direction," Altman said on stage. "We try to cut them off or suggest to the user to maybe think about something differently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"The broader topic of mental health and the way that interacts with over-reliance on AI models is something we’re trying to take extremely seriously and rapidly," he added. "We don’t want to slide into the mistakes that the previous generation of tech companies made by not reacting quickly enough as a new thing had a psychological interaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft was more concise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"We are continuously researching, monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Experts outside the AI industry aren't convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think that there should be liability for things that cause harm," said Pierre. But in reality, he said, regulations and new guardrails are often enacted only after bad outcomes are made public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Something bad happens, and it's like, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; we're going to build in the safeguards, rather than anticipating them from the get-go," said Pierre. "The rules get made because someone gets hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in the eyes of people caught in the wreckage of this hastily deployed technology, the harms can feel as though, at least in part, they are by design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's f*cking predatory... it just increasingly affirms your bullshit and blows smoke up your ass so that it can get you f*cking hooked on wanting to engage with it," said one of the women whose husband was involuntarily committed following a ChatGPT-tied break with reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is what the first person to get hooked on a slot machine felt like," she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recounted how confusing it was trying to understand what was happening to her husband. He had always been a soft-spoken person, she said, but became unrecognizable as ChatGPT took over his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We were trying to hold our resentment and hold our sadness and hold our judgment and just keep things going while we let everything work itself out," she said. "But it just got worse, and I miss him, and I love him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;More on ChatGPT: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-illness-medications" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;ChatGPT Is Telling People With Psychiatric Problems to Go Off Their Meds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 13:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1ZYkVKZndyc3o5WnRLSWx5ZEgxMkdnVGhjOWo5aVlGcUhCb2hKaWR6ZDhfNFUxSWp4RWRDdGRyekJsU0YwQm5YaDhzQjVuNGQzRThZN3pwWlNNVjFRRVg5OGVWMEU</guid></item><item><title>（我们的钱呢？ “CDC拨款资金正在缓慢流动，因此裁员正在发生- NPR | 'Where's our money?'

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Health departments around the country have noticed there's something strange happening with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: It's not showing up on schedule and there's been no communication about why.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal public health agency doles out &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/cdcs-funding-for-state-and-local-public-health-how-much-and-where-does-it-go/" target="_blank"&gt;most of the money&lt;/a&gt; it receives from Congress to state and local health departments, which then contract with local organizations. That's how public health work gets funded in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to two CDC staff members with knowledge of the agency's budget, the CDC has yet to receive its full funding for the 2025 fiscal year. NPR agreed not to name the staff members because they were not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both CDC staffers say the funding is now months late, and it will soon be too late to disperse the agency's grants that local health departments are waiting on. In the interim, the CDC has been operating with just 30-days of funding at a time. The staffers say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding. One of them called it "rescission by inertia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not answer NPR's questions for this story or respond to a request for comment on that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A big change from the usual process&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," says &lt;a href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/about/admin.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who runs Alabama's health department and is the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "Less than 10% of our money comes from state dollars."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing really can happen if we don't know that we're going to get the money — if there's no notice of award," Harris explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, the CDC's notices of award are just not arriving on schedule. "For example, one of our cardiovascular grants expires at the end of this month," he says "We don't have any notice of award, so it's really risky for us to incur a bunch of costs over the next several weeks doing work in this program, not knowing if we have the ability to get reimbursed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Harris says he's heard from state health departments across the country who are in the same situation with CDC funding being mysteriously delayed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Grants related to HIV prevention work in many states expired at the end of May with no information about future funding. In Ohio, that meant the state's HIV hotline and the delivery of free test-at-home-kits were &lt;a href="https://thebuckeyeflame.com/2025/06/25/ohio-hiv-hotline-stops-services-after-federal-grant-delay/" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly halted&lt;/a&gt;. The San Antonio AIDS Foundation had to &lt;a href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/local/san-antonio-aids-foundation-pauses-testing-funds-cut-health/273-18b5c7a8-b16b-4e1e-b591-104e39d3d462" target="_blank"&gt;pause its testing services&lt;/a&gt;. And in Charlotte, North Carolina, the funding delays led to job losses at the local health department, explains Mecklenburg County Health Commissioner &lt;a href="https://health.mecknc.gov/About" target="_blank"&gt;Raynard Washington&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The majority of those six people that we sent home at the beginning of June were disease investigation specialist staff — contact tracers for HIV, syphilis and other STIs," Washington says, referring to sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The result on the ground is that our other staff that we have that do that work have to take on more workload, and then very often we end up getting behind," he says. Getting behind could mean that people who have potentially been exposed to something don't know it, he adds. "The ultimate risk is that they are also then exposing other people and then the chain just continues from there to grow."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for more grants will expire soon, says &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt;, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. Huang says the state health department just warned them that if they don't receive notices of award for some immunization and emergency preparedness grants they would have to pause the activities funded by those grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[That] is extremely distressing to us because we have like 60 staff on those grants and significant funding that are affected," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Washington adds that North Carolina has not received a new notice of award for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cervical-cancer-screening/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;breast and cervical cancer screening program&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The CDC is operating with an "eyedropper" monthly budget&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, President Trump signed a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which included $9 billion for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once [a budget] is passed and signed by the president, there is always a lag," explained one of the CDC staff members who spoke to NPR who is a senior leader at the agency. There's an "apportionment" process to give each agency its money, which usually takes between 45 and 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During this period, to be able to make payroll and keep up with regular bills, the CDC is given money in 30-day increments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year? "Forty-five days came and went. Sixty days came and went, more and more time came and went — no word, no information," the CDC senior leader explains. "We keep asking — where's our money? Where's the money that's been approved by Congress?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC can't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to continue their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Month after month of funding in 30-day increments is like receiving money "with an eyedropper," the senior leader adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not answer NPR's questions about the reasons for these funding delays at the CDC by publication time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The staffers at the CDC say they are running out of time to be able to spend the agency's 2025 funds before the end of the fiscal year in September because of all the steps involved in getting funding out the door.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The money just doesn't flow from one account or the other — people have to actually do the manual work of connecting the funds that are provided to the actual accounts at the appropriate levels," the other CDC staffer explains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If they can delay until the end of September, then that's it," the staffer adds. "Those projects are not going to happen. That money goes straight back to Treasury."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why both CDC staffers who spoke with NPR say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"At this point, it is absolutely our assumption that it is being done intentionally to grind us to a halt," the senior leader says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to a request for comment on that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;HIV funds showed up late, but uncertainty remains&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This week, state health departments received word that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;End the HIV Epidemic&lt;/a&gt; grants that expired at the end of May were finally being awarded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no explanation for the delay, says Washington, the health commissioner in Charlotte, N.C.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I have to go figure out if the staff that we laid off are willing to come back to work," he says. "If they're not willing, then we have to start hiring, have to train — we've lost months of work because of administrative delays."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the delays continue, he says. There's been no communication about what might happen with the many grants that expire on Monday, as June ends. "Throughout this experience, we've just been told, 'We don't have any answers,'" he says. "That's the hard part when you're trying to plan."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Harris of Alabama agrees. "We have to get paid to do these things, whether it's tobacco prevention or diabetes work or public health preparedness or whatever it is," he says. "We can't really do it without the funding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Their work was meticulous, their data hard-won. Then, just as they submitted their research for publication, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="SkjHlaXlwTVle" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjb900jh7gx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a5b4i-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;an Iranian missile struck their building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="3bqv4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3bqv4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3bqv4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The direct hit threatened to obliterate everything: priceless samples, sensitive data, and the collective effort of countless sleepless nights.

Published today in Nature Medicine, their study introduces a non-invasive blood test that can detect early processes of leukemia and, for the first time, predict how quickly a person’s blood system is aging—without the need for a painful bone marrow biopsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7vcq9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Their labs have spent recent years diving deep into the biology of blood to understand why some people become more vulnerable to disease with age.

They stop differentiating properly, produce only themselves, and suppress the production of healthy cells. Eventually, this can lead to deadly diseases like blood cancers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ftcbr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The problem? These damaged cells are tucked away in the bone marrow and invisible to standard blood tests. Until now, the only way to detect them was through a bone marrow biopsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cqgov-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“It's a very painful test performed under sedation or local anesthesia, where a needle drills into the bone to extract a sample,” he says. “Beyond the discomfort, it's expensive, complicated, and requires high-level expertise—and sometimes it doesn't even produce a definitive result. In some cases, physicians can’t agree on whether a cell is healthy or not.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bpm74-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;So Shlush and Tanay set out to do the impossible: replace the biopsy with a simple blood test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="80o7v-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Their focus was on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), an age-related condition in which stem cells fail to mature into functional blood cells.

We had to isolate them, characterize them, and determine whether they were healthy or diseased using dozens of parameters and methods that can handle extremely small quantities of cells.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7uai1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To make sense of the enormous data generated, Shlush turned to Prof. Amos Tanay. “Each cell produces tens of thousands of data points, and we had data from millions of cells. Prof. Tanay is a world expert in analyzing such data. That was the essence of our collaboration: a doctor-scientist and a data-scientist working together.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72q7p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;They brought in participants—scientists, students, young and old—drew their blood, and began profiling the rare cells. “Older people’s cells looked different than younger ones. Men’s cells looked different from women’s. And someone with high blood fat levels showed distinct patterns too. Then we brought in 80 patients and compared their cells to the healthy ones. That’s how we discovered how diseased cells differ.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="css3d-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="css3d-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="css3d-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;By analyzing samples from people ranging in age up to 95, they uncovered new mechanisms of how blood ages—insights previously hidden from even the best bone marrow analyses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2jehj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One of the most striking discoveries: “As part of the aging process, we lose certain types of blood cells earlier in men than in women,” Shlush says. “Men’s blood ages faster, and that may explain why men have a higher incidence of blood cancers. We think this explains part of the gap.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cl9nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers believe the test could be used not just for MDS or leukemia, but a wide range of hematologic disorders. “We can now read the aging mechanisms of the blood system at unprecedented depth. If we understand them better, we may one day be able to halt them,” says Shlush. Clinical trials based on their findings are already underway at several medical centers worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="b456n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b456n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b456n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;And they hope their test will eventually replace bone marrow biopsies altogether. “In the U.S. alone, nearly a million bone marrow biopsies are performed every year. Globally, the numbers are even higher,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="36j9" data-offset-key="4n109-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4n109-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4n109-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Just days before publication, Shlush’s lab was rocked by a direct missile strike during the Iranian barrage on Israel.

Recent research suggests marijuana use may be associated with impaired male fertility by decreasing sperm volume, affecting sperm morphology and disrupting hormone balance. Patel advises limiting cannabis use when trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Along with cannabis, alcohol consumption and smoking can be detrimental to fertility. Toxins from smoking, for instance, can directly damage sperm DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Physical health plays a crucial role too -- being overweight and having inadequate physical activity can negatively impact fertility. Even high stress levels can affect reproductive health, making stress management an essential consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you're trying to improve fertility, focus on eating a regular diet, exercising, managing stress, and reducing both cannabis and alcohol use," Patel recommended. "It's also important to have an open conversation with your doctor, especially if you're using substances for medical reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Speaking of health management, recent studies have revealed promising developments in other areas of medical science. Research has shown that medications prescribed for individuals with ADHS were associated with lower risks of self-harm and accidents, demonstrating the importance of proper medical treatment in overall safety and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, for those looking to boost their cognitive function, a new study suggests that strategic power naps might be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;German researchers found that short afternoon naps were associated with enhanced problem-solving abilities and creativity -- though Patel advises keeping these naps to 20 to 30 minutes to avoid disrupting nighttime sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 02:16:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOc0hzTzROX0FORHhTVTNPRXZfZGJ3TjhvR3labG02cmZaLVM0M1lNa1lfVFlSa0lwSUI0OUFxbXkxb2UyUl9XWEF3S1p6TXQyV0xZYllQWDkxd1ZJeUNJbGtNM0ZNMHFMY0V4a2hZcXV2cVRDaTZ6ZnhUdU5yWVVtRXBOMVZpUUQzUlM3V1JEbDFUTzlfUFpweVJtR25aUW4wR045Y0lB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE0teklVYlVkUmQwQVE1ZmF6TXZ5WFVva3NINFR0LTZsLWdsblgxc0xUXzZ2cXd6anZIYU9zVVFOR1hEVF8zMEY2Z21GWXd0SEpxbjR3M0JpMFl6TjVYc01TbVpMZHU1V3NuSTZaemdzOEtnSzFyRDhoZm96QjRsOVAtLTRPbmU4emZHYTR0MmN6bXNqNDRXY0R3WEQ1VUlPYy1wN216ZXQ4OVZ1QQ</guid></item><item><title>李子会让你马上大便吗？以及其他便秘问题，由专家解答- BuzzFeed | Do Prunes Make You Poop Right Away?

&lt;p&gt;Both prune juice and whole prunes are effective in treating constipation, Jow said. However, there are some differences to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole prunes have more fiber because the juicing process removes some. An 8-ounce serving of one &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1102758/nutrients" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;cup of prune juice&lt;/a&gt; contains about 2.5 grams of fiber, while a &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/mott/pdf/mott-fiber-chart.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;serving of 10 prunes&lt;/a&gt; contains about 6 grams of fiber. Moreover, “whole prunes have double the amount of sorbitol in the same serving size compared to prune juice,” Jow said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of whole prunes over prune juice is that prune juice has more sugar and calories than dried prunes. While this may not make a difference if you only consume prune juice once in a while, it can add up over time, Jow cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jow, the “bottom line” is that both prune juice and dried prunes will help you go. If you prefer the taste of prune juice, you will still get the laxative benefits prunes provide, but whole prunes are a healthier choice, and you won’t need as many servings to get the same amount of fiber and sorbitol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take for prunes to relieve constipation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will vary from person to person, ranging from “a few hours to a day,” Jow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help things along, Jow advised, “It is important to drink plenty of water while taking prunes to stay hydrated and help enhance the effectiveness of the prunes and the function of the digestive system.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many prunes do you need to get things going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of prunes you need to relieve constipation “varies depending on age and severity,” Jow said. To start, he suggests giving children one to two prunes or 2-4 ounces of prune juice a day. For adults, Jow recommends starting with three to five prunes or half a cup of prune juice daily or twice daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you have too many prunes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When backed up, drinking an entire container of prune juice or down handfuls of dried prunes may be tempting. That might be especially true if the recommended amounts aren’t working for you. However, Jow urges caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible to eat too many prunes,” leading to unwanted side effects, he said. “Excess fiber can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, gas and even diarrhea. Sorbitol is a natural laxative, so consuming too large of a quantity can also cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea,” Jow explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because everyone reacts differently to prunes, Jow suggests starting with a small amount and gradually increasing consumption until you get the desired effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood also cautions that because prunes, like all dried fruit, are high in sugar and calories, those with “advanced or uncontrolled diabetes” use a sugar-free over-the-counter laxative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-do-prunes-make-you-poop-doctors-explain-their-ringing-endorsement_l_65946316e4b0912833ae13ea" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The team at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.phage-collection.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Phage Collection Project&lt;/a&gt; sent me some vials to collect samples, along with a pair of gloves.

I didn't flush the toilet after a poo and left it for a couple of hours. I pop on a glove and hold my breath as I go in for the final sample. Strict hygiene instructions, including vigorous hand-washing, were followed, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vials were packaged up for collection and then three days later I headed off to the University of Southampton to see what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They were a bit dirty when I received them," phage scientist Michelle Lin tells me as we don our blue lab-coats and matching gloves to go into the Containment Level 2 microbiology laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We grab my samples from the fridge, which look much clearer now they have been filtered of any… debris. "It's fine, it's needed," Michelle, who had the unpleasant job, reassures me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Michelle Lin holding the cleaned up sample of my toilet water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Filtering is the first step in looking for phage, next they get served dinner – a cocktail of yummy bacteria - to help them grow in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now comes the really cool bit – finding a useful phage. The scientists have been working with the local hospital to collect bacteria from patients with troublesome infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Michelle grabs a petri dish that's growing bacteria from a patient with a painful, urinary tract infection that keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And to my amazement – one of the phage I collected from my toilet was able to kill this infection in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The way to see that the phage has infected bacteria is you get these zones where the bacteria are not growing and that's because they've been killed by the phage," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The small off-white areas are where the bacteria are still growing, but in most of the sample petri dish there are dead zones where the phage has gorged on the bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;You can see the leopard print pattern in the petri dish where the phage have been making light work of a bacterial infection that modern medicine was struggling to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As crazy as it sounds, well done to the toilet sample," says Michelle with great delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And when I was offered the chance to name the phage, well of course it's the Gallagher-phage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Sounds amazing to me," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far this is all good fun in the laboratory, but could my phage ever be given to a patient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Yes and I hope so," says associate professor Dr Franklin Nobrega as we look at images of my phage captured with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The virus has been named the Gallagher-phage, after me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Your phage, already in just 24 hours, we were able to get in a high concentration and able to be a very good killer, which means this is very promising for patients, so thank you," said Dr Nobrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Phage remind me of a moon lander – a big capsule on spindly legs – just instead of landing on the surface of the moon they use their legs to select their victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They then hijack the bacteria and transform it into a mass-production factory for more phage, which burst out of their host, killing it in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are pros and cons to phage. They reproduce as they go along so you don't need constant doses like you would with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are also very picky eaters. You need a precise match between phage and the strain of bacteria you're trying to treat whereas antibiotics tend to kill everything good and bad. So it is harder to find the right phage, but if you do it comes with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Nobrega tells me infected wounds are a "very good application" for phage because you can apply them directly to the injury, but they can also be inhaled via a nebuliser to treat lung infections or to target urinary tract infections "which is our target currently".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The phage has a five spindly legs a corkscrew body and then atop it sits an angular capsule.

The drugs are also used to make organ transplants, open surgery and chemotherapy possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The predictions around antibiotic resistance are very frightening, but the reality is we're seeing it now and it's only going to get worse," says Prof Paul Elkington, the director of the institute for medical innovation at the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The Phage Collection Project team at the University of Southampton are keen to get samples from the public&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He is also a doctor with a speciality in lung medicine and is already at the point where - after a year of treatment and turning to ever more toxic and less effective antibiotics - "in the end you have to have a conversation [and say] 'we can't treat this infection, we're really sorry'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says we can't rely solely on antibiotics in the future and phage are a potential alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he warns the steps needed to get from the laboratory and into patients are "uncharted".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Things are changing. Phage therapy is available in the UK on compassionate grounds when other treatments have failed.

			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

By recording electrical activity directly from the brains of five patients during a visual task, scientists discovered that specific thalamic regions activate earlier and more strongly during moments of visual awareness. These findings suggest that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei act as a gateway that initiates conscious perception by influencing the activity of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus is a small, egg-shaped structure located deep in the center of the brain. It acts as a hub for relaying sensory information—like sight, sound, and touch—to the cerebral cortex, where perception and interpretation occur. In addition to this relay role, it also helps regulate alertness, sleep, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the thalamus has long been understood as a relay station for sensory information, it has been largely viewed as a supporting actor—important for maintaining wakefulness, but not the actual source of conscious experience. The current study challenges this idea, offering new evidence that the thalamus does more than just relay signals. It may actively shape what enters our conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the research team took advantage of a unique opportunity to record deep brain activity in humans. Five adult men undergoing treatment for severe, drug-resistant headaches had stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes implanted in their brains. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor neural activity in real-time across multiple brain regions, including various parts of the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a visual awareness task that presented images at the edge of conscious visibility. On each trial, a patterned stimulus briefly appeared to one side of a central fixation point. Some images were bright and clearly visible, while others were faint and difficult to detect. Occasionally, no stimulus was shown at all. After each trial, participants responded with an eye movement indicating whether they had seen the stimulus and where it had appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This setup allowed the researchers to compare brain activity between trials where participants consciously saw the stimulus and trials where they did not, even though the visual input was nearly identical. This critical contrast helped isolate the neural processes specifically linked to awareness, rather than simple sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that certain regions deep within the thalamus—specifically the central medial nucleus, mediodorsal medial nucleus, and parafascicular nucleus—showed increased activity during trials when participants reported seeing the stimulus. These regions are known as the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei. Their responses occurred earlier and with greater intensity than activity in other thalamic regions, such as the ventral nuclei, and even earlier than responses in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a range of analyses, the researchers found that these high-order thalamic nuclei exhibited stronger electrical signals, increased low-frequency oscillations, and more synchronized activity during moments of awareness. Importantly, the timing of this activity—beginning around 200 milliseconds after stimulus presentation—aligned with the earliest known brain signatures of conscious perception, such as the visual awareness negativity signal recorded in prior scalp-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these signals travel through the brain, the researchers examined how different brain regions communicated during conscious versus unconscious trials. They measured the synchronization of neural oscillations, particularly in the theta frequency range (about 4–8 Hz), which has been linked to cognitive control and awareness. They also analyzed cross-frequency coupling, which describes how slow brain rhythms may coordinate faster activity in other areas. Both measures revealed that the intralaminar and medial thalamic regions drove neural coordination with the prefrontal cortex during conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, when participants were aware of the stimulus, the thalamus was not simply reacting to sensory input—it was actively shaping the brain’s response, sending signals to the prefrontal cortex and helping to organize brain-wide activity in support of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed that the neural patterns in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex encoded information about whether participants were consciously aware of the stimulus, rather than simply reflecting aspects of the task like contrast strength, motor response, or reaction time. This strengthens the case that these regions are directly involved in conscious perception, rather than just downstream reflections of other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also found that the activity in the thalamus, particularly in the intralaminar and medial nuclei, could begin even before the stimulus appeared. This pre-stimulus activity was more synchronized in trials where participants would later report being aware of the stimulus, suggesting that these regions may help set the stage for conscious perception by influencing the brain’s state of readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to offer such detailed recordings from multiple thalamic nuclei in humans during a task designed to probe the boundary between conscious and unconscious visual perception. Prior studies using imaging methods like functional MRI or magnetoencephalography hinted at thalamic involvement in awareness but lacked the precision to pinpoint when and where this activity occurred. The use of sEEG here provided a rare opportunity to capture the dynamics of deep brain structures with both high temporal and spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide strong support for the idea that consciousness is not solely a cortical phenomenon. Instead, the thalamus—especially its high-order nuclei—appears to play an active and early role in making sensory information available to our awareness. This may reflect the thalamus’s unique position as a hub, with widespread connections to both cortical and subcortical brain regions, allowing it to coordinate complex patterns of neural activity required for consciousness to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors note some limitations. The study was conducted in a small sample of five male patients, all of whom had electrodes implanted for clinical reasons related to headache treatment. Although their cognitive abilities and vision were intact, these participants do not represent the general population. Moreover, electrode placement was determined by medical need, not research goals, which means some brain regions may have been under-sampled or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the study strongly suggests that intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei initiate the conscious perception process, it does not rule out important contributions from the cortex. The prefrontal cortex, particularly the lateral regions, still showed significant activity and participated in synchronized neural networks during awareness. The researchers suggest that the thalamus may act as a gate or initiator, while the cortex elaborates on the content of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr3675" target="_blank"&gt;Human high-order thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception through the thalamofrontal loop&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zepeng Fang, Yuanyuan Dang, An’an Ping, Chenyu Wang, Qianchuan Zhao, Hulin Zhao, Xiaoli Li, and Mingsha Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQa3plSlhwazlCa3Y1Mm8xbElfS0Q0ay1McXh6U2Y1UEZsWERmdFl6SXZCMTgxaVByTVhfaUVWelhyQUpiSzNmTHRBeFBmNk1Pank3RTdXZm9YTTVzakZUUHJXb3pkaEMyLUVySVdpOHNsV196Q28zVTctSU1vTUVGaThxNDk2LWZuTlJjTHhuWkg</guid></item><item><title>电惊厥疗法冠军Max Fink去世，享年102岁-《纽约时报》 | Max Fink, Champion of Electroconvulsive Therapy, Dies at 102 - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 21:57:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将这些食物与认知衰退风险降低80 ％联系起来- EatingWell | Scientists Just Connected These Foods with an 80% Lower Risk of Cognitive Decline - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQLU1pdUFqdTVpdzcwcFpOdXFPOUExVkN1VmdzTzVzZ3gxNlN2elFhakUzMXFkVnludVhlVGJ2Q3o3US0wUmg3NmUtb0thMDgwYkVuWkJnNWpId1NXUTJYQjlybTNmblY5d3p6U3R3ZGVCVWlSX2NFX2lRcEI1VzFTVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you misplace your keys for the third time in a week or blank on a close friend’s name, it’s hard not to wonder: Is this normal aging—or something more? Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition marked by subtle but noticeable changes in memory and thinking. And it’s surprisingly common among older adults. It affects nearly one third of people over age 65, and for many, it’s an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;early warning sign of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike normal age-related forgetfulness, mild cognitive impairment can make it harder to manage daily tasks and can progress into more serious cognitive decline. While there’s still no cure for Alzheimer’s or other dementias, researchers are zeroing in on strategies to help delay or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. Diet is one of the most promising—and controllable—factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many studies have suggested that antioxidant-rich foods may protect the brain, but questions remain: How much do they help? And what about other common habits, like drinking alcohol—does it cancel out any benefits? To explore these questions, researchers looked at the relationship between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol consumption, and the risk of mild cognitive impairment in older adults. They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;—and the results may inspire you to rethink what’s on your plate and in your glass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a cross-sectional study, meaning it looked at data from a single point in time rather than following participants over a period of years. Researchers gathered data from 1,084 adults aged 55 and older living in Zhejiang Province, China. Participants answered questions about their diet, lifestyle, alcohol consumption and health history. They completed a cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a widely used tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers used a validated dietary questionnaire to calculate a Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) for each person. The CDAI is based on six key antioxidants: vitamins A, C and E, as well as magnesium, zinc and selenium. Participants were sorted into four groups based on their CDAI scores, from lowest to highest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found a clear pattern: people with higher antioxidant index scores had lower odds of having mild cognitive impairment—up to an 80% reduced risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these risk reduction benefits aren’t for everybody across the board. When researchers looked at how alcohol and antioxidants interacted, they found that the protective effects of antioxidants were only statistically significant among people who didn’t drink alcohol at all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, drinking any alcohol seemed to cancel out some of the brain benefits of a high-antioxidant diet. And  people who drank alcohol one to two times a week had more than double the odds of having mild cognitive impairment compared to non-drinkers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, because this was a cross-sectional study, it can only show associations—not cause and effect. The dietary data was also self-reported, and people aren’t always 100% inaccurate when remembering what they ate. And while the study accounted for many factors that might influence brain health (like age, education and depression), it didn’t account for the amount or type of alcohol consumed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings support what many nutrition experts have been saying for years: antioxidants help protect the brain and alcohol—despite the hype around red wine—may do more harm than good when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.

Using functional MRI, researchers observed how volunteers responded to demanding memory tasks and how their willingness to continue changed based on internal fatigue and external rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mentally drained participants felt, the more activity these brain regions showed—yet higher financial incentives still pushed them to keep going. These insights could help guide treatments for fatigue-related conditions like depression and PTSD by offering a measurable, biological view of mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue Circuits Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show heightened activity during cognitive fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort vs. Incentive:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher monetary rewards increased participants’ willingness to exert mental effort, even when fatigued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for mental exhaustion in PTSD, depression, and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In experiments with healthy volunteers undergoing functional MRI imaging, scientists have found increased activity in two areas of the brain that work together to react to, and possibly regulate, the brain when it’s “feeling” tired and either quits or continues exerting mental effort. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments, designed to help detect various aspects of brain fatigue, may provide a way for physicians to better evaluate and treat people who experience overwhelming mental exhaustion, including those with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the scientists say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111241"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows two people and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report on the NIH-funded study was published online June 11 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, detailing results on 18 female and 10 male healthy adult volunteers given tasks to exercise their memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lab focuses on how [our minds] generate value for effort,” says Vikram Chib, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We understand less about the biology of cognitive tasks, including memory and recall, than we do about physical tasks, even though both involve a lot of effort.” Anecdotally, Chib says, scientists know cognitive tasks are tiring, and relatively less about why and how such fatigue develops and plays out in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28 study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 29, were paid $50 to participate in the study, and were told they could receive additional payments based on their performance and choices. All participants received a baseline MRI scan before the experiments began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. The farther back a letter was in the series of letters, the harder it was to recall its position, increasing the cognitive effort expended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were given feedback on their performance after each test and opportunities to receive increasing payments ($1–$8) with more difficult recall exercises. The participants also were asked before and after each test to self-rate their level of cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the test results found increased activity and connectivity in two brain areas when participants reported cognitive fatigue: the right insula, an area deep in the brain that has been associated with feelings of fatigue, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, areas on both sides of the brain that control working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each participant, activity in both brain locations during cognitive fatigue increased by more than twice the level of baseline measurements taken before starting the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was designed to induce cognitive fatigue and see how people’s choices to exert effort change when they feel fatigue, as well as identify locations in the brain where these decisions are made,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Chib and his research team members Grace Steward and Vivian Looi found that the financial incentives need to be high in order for participants to exert increased cognitive effort, suggesting that external incentives prompt such effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That outcome wasn’t entirely surprising, given our previous work finding the same need for incentives in spurring physical effort,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two areas of the brain may be working together to decide to avoid more cognitive effort unless there are more incentives offered. However, there may be a discrepancy between perceptions in cognitive fatigue and what the human brain is actually capable of doing,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is linked with many neurological conditions, including PTSD and depression, says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve likely identified some of the neural circuits for cognitive effort in healthy people, we need to look at how fatigue manifests in the brains of people with these conditions,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib says it may be possible to use medication or cognitive behavior therapy to combat cognitive fatigue, and the current study using decision tasks and functional MRI could be a framework for objectively classifying cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI uses blood flow to measure broad areas of activity in the brain; however, it does not directly measure neuron activation, nor more subtle nuances in brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was performed in an MRI scanner and with very specific cognitive tasks. It will be important to see how these results generalize to other cognitive effort and real-world tasks,” says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01HD097619, R01MH119086).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d2a3c2e293c1d3735303473383928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanessa Wasta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhmi.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanessa Wasta – Johns Hopkins University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1612-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/a&gt;” by Vikram Chib et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants (18 females, 10 males) chose to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward for more effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual’s decisions to exert while fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:20:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE55SGNoSVhndFREN0dXMHNoXzVnZDBwMHRUQjBscm1kTmZtYlF6NWdUXzgwandoc2FOMm9RSjk2QllNVHI0NEZZNkQyejF4Wi05Y3p6VmNoV1hON21tMm1QbUZZOUdYNHVXY3BhSUNxT1BmWGxG</guid></item><item><title>新研究将间歇性禁食与通过大脑多巴胺系统改善情绪联系起来- PsyPost | New study links intermittent fasting to improved mood via brain’s dopamine system - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting may help alleviate depression symptoms by targeting dopamine receptors in the brain, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Neurobiology of Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Traditional antidepressants can take weeks to take effect and often come with undesirable side effects. Researchers have been exploring alternative strategies to improve mental health, and one promising avenue is nutrition. Intermittent fasting — a dietary pattern that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting — has gained increasing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that fasting may influence the brain’s neurotransmitter systems, but the precise mechanisms have remained unclear. In this new research, scientists investigated whether intermittent fasting could reduce depression-like symptoms by acting on dopamine D1 receptors, which are known to play a key role in mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, a research team led by Jingjing Piao from the Second Hospital of Jilin University in China used a well-established mouse model of depression known as Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were exposed to a series of randomly arranged stressors over several weeks — such as foot shocks, water deprivation, and tail pinching — to mimic the effects of chronic stress in humans. After this period, some of the mice were placed on an intermittent fasting schedule that alternated 24-hour periods of food availability with 24-hour fasting. For comparison, other groups of mice received the common antidepressant fluoxetine or underwent a shorter 9-hour fasting period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Mice in the intermittent fasting group showed marked improvements in depression-related behaviors. They were more likely to engage in pleasurable activities, such as drinking a sugar solution — a sign of reduced anhedonia, or loss of pleasure. These mice also exhibited decreased immobility in behavioral tests designed to assess despair-like symptoms, suggesting greater resilience to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how intermittent fasting produced these effects, the researchers examined the mice’s brain activity. They found increased neuronal activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region involved in emotional regulation. More specifically, intermittent fasting enhanced activity in the Drd1-cAMP-PKA-DARPP-32-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway — a cascade of molecular events associated with dopamine D1 receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers administered a drug that blocked dopamine D1 receptors, the antidepressant-like effects of intermittent fasting disappeared. This indicated that the benefits were directly dependent on this dopamine pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments using optogenetics — a technique that uses light to control the activity of specific neurons — reinforced this conclusion. When the researchers artificially activated dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the mPFC, the mice exhibited behavioral improvements similar to those seen with fasting. Conversely, inhibiting these neurons reversed the effects of fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer promising insights into the biological mechanisms linking intermittent fasting and depression, the researchers acknowledge key limitations. The study was conducted in mice, and more research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Intermittent fasting produces antidepressant-like effects by modulating dopamine D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jingjing Piao, Hongyu Chen, Xinmiao Piao, Ziqian Cheng, Fangyi Zhao, Ranji Cui, and Bingjin Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:08:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州新报告的4例麻疹病例- WKYT | 4 new measles cases reported in Kentucky - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5zV3JkazhLYk0zRFZ5VGtvUGlvZ2t1Q2lFX3BDbTNzc29YR3JWQW1yWG1rdno0UzFqZUNPMENDWFdkeHM1WGJManhoaC1nMndMNmJIT1FVSmMxYnNTS3g1RTl3T00yZk9zb2NnQ2ppNE5QSWg4XzVrOUtR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;KENTUCKY (WKYT) - Officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced four new measles cases were reported in the state this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Three cases are part of the same household in Woodford County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The fourth case, involving someone known to have been exposed to measles while traveling internationally, is in Todd County and unrelated to the other three cases, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials are working to identify others who may have been exposed to those infected while they were contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;None of the four were vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;These new cases bring the total number of measles cases reported in Kentucky this year to six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Kentucky’s &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/02/27/health-officials-announce-confirmed-measles-case-kentucky/" rel=""&gt;first confirmed measles case of 2025&lt;/a&gt; occurred in an adult Franklin County resident in February.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D may help prevent heart disease or related events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart disease continues to rank as the top most lethal disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speak with a healthcare provider before starting a vitamin supplement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may already know that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.—back in 2022, around one in five deaths in the U.S. was due to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, experts are projecting that by 2035, 45% of American adults will be living with heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that dying from heart disease is highly preventable, and scientists are continually looking for ways to prevent it. Besides lifestyle habits, like a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, managing stressors and getting plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-longevity-11758701" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are specific nutrients that may be particularly helpful. Vitamin D is one of them, as evidence suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low blood levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; may increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is a tricky nutrient because very few foods contain it. Our bodies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manufacture vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when we’re exposed to sunlight. But enough of the body needs to be exposed—arms, legs and face—for long enough, which poses some potential problems for people trying to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11736017" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prevent skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; or who easily burn. It’s also difficult for those who live in colder winter climates to get enough skin exposure year-round. For this reason, vitamin D is one of the vitamins that may need to be supplemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers did a narrative review of studies on vitamin D and heart disease. They reported their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched databases for studies on vitamin D and cardiovascular disease and reported the studies’ findings. As they narrowed down the field of studies, the researchers considered studies that used &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplementation&lt;/a&gt; or assessed participants’ level of vitamin D with bloodwork.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this was a narrative review, they didn’t analyze the data; they simply reported the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that while the mechanisms by which vitamin D reduces heart disease risk are well understood, clinical evidence of these benefits remains scant, due to a lack of well-designed studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, here are some of the major findings researchers picked up in their review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 60%, gestational diabetes by 50% and preterm delivery by 40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with prediabetes may be able to significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by supplementing with vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In people taking statins (to help lower cholesterol) or cardiovascular medications, supplementing with vitamin D may lower the risk of major cardiovascular events by 13% to 17%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Limitations of any narrative review include difficulty finding high-quality studies and bias in interpreting the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that vitamin D is essential for many bodily processes, including healthy bones and immune and nerve function. There is also evidence that vitamin D may play a role in preventing depression. Regarding heart disease, more and more evidence is stacking up in vitamin D’s favor. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11735001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that suggests that vitamin D deficiency may increase your risk of heart disease by 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a vitamin that people are commonly deficient in. And researchers do not always agree on who and how much people should supplement. The only way to know if you’re deficient in vitamin D is to be tested, but some professional organizations, like the Endocrine Society, state that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;, and that most people do not need to supplement. So, how do you know?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some things to consider include where you live, how often you get outside with skin exposed and how many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; you eat. Foods that contain vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring, swordfish, sardines), beef liver, cod liver oil and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, like milk, orange juice and cereal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, adults over 70, children and teens require more vitamin D. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;if you’re pregnant or have osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to increase your intake, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of where you’re at in the life cycle, if you know you’re not regularly eating vitamin D foods or getting outside often and long enough with enough skin exposure, it’s probably feasible to request a blood test from a medical professional. If the test suggests you’re deficient, talk to them or seek the advice of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;registered dietitian regarding supplementation&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Seeking professional advice is important because vitamin D is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;. If you take too much over time, it can build up in your body and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;can even become lethal&lt;/a&gt;. So, having a health professional work with you find the dose that’s right for you can be helpful.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This narrative review adds to the mounting evidence that vitamin D plays an essential role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and heart-disease-related events.

Two years later, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor and says he has been cancer-free ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors remain fiercely skeptical, warning that even the strictest vegan diet cannot replace chemotherapy or immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fremont claims that the plant-based diet and healthy lifestyle cured his colorectal metastases.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without treatment, survival rates drop to just 44 percent after three years, making medical intervention absolutely crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A former Yale University wrestler, Fremont had been an avid runner since the 70s when he was grieving the death of his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first of more than a dozen marathons was the 1972 Boston Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why it was so shocking when Fremont got the world-upending news in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.greatveganathletes.com/mike-fremont-vegan-runner/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I contracted a cancer which the Cleveland Clinic said would kill me in 3 months unless operated upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said no, I was going on a diet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The tumor had metastasized into my lymphatic system and would have required efforts to treat the metastases with radiation and/or chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later he underwent an operation to remove the tumor from his colon when it began to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the procedure, doctors checked for cancer spread in 35 places around Fremont’s body, he said, and found zero signs of cancer spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont believes that his stellar health and advanced age are primarily due to his habits, rather than genetics.

	They may be smaller than their refillable counterparts, but some disposable e-&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/cigarettes/" id="auto-tag_cigarettes" data-tag="cigarettes"&gt;cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; actually emit more toxic metals than older vapes and traditional cigarettes, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Davis, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Disposable e-cigarettes are the newest nicotine delivery systems on the market, and the most popular — particularly among adolescents, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7335a3.htm?s_cid=mm7335a3_w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;reported in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike traditional vapes, which are refilled with pods, disposable e-cigarettes come pre-filled and are discarded after use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	E-cigarettes are made up of metal coils and other metallic components that are in constant contact with e-liquid solution, which contains nicotine salt, flavorings, and organic acids. When nicotine salts are introduced into the e-liquid, and it is heated, it causes metal to dissolve. So when a smoker takes a puff, they’re inhaling aerosolized toxic metals as well as nicotine.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“We’ve known for a long time that when you heat a coil [in an e-cigarette] and it goes through the heat cycle, it will leach metals over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.etox.ucdavis.edu/people/brett-poulin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Brett Poulin, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology and senior author of the study. “People have documented that in a lot of different electronic cigarettes. But the unique part of this study is that we found elements in what we call the ‘virgin e-liquid,’ meaning that the device has never been used.” 

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	This design is known as a “closed system,” so you’re not changing out the coil, which Poulin says was a common feature of the previous-generation devices, and may help explain why the newer disposable e-cigarettes are more harmful. “And so when you have a closed system, you essentially just end up accumulating a lot of those metals over time, and you end up with higher concentrations in the aerosol that people breathe,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone.&lt;/em&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Additionally, the researchers found that disposable e-cigarettes contained antimony — a toxic metalloid — which wasn’t previously seen in older generations of e-cigarettes. “We identified [antimony] at high concentrations in the unused e-liquids of these devices,” says Mark Salazar, a PhD candidate in Poulin’s lab. “And we found that as the devices are aged and they’re puffed more and more, you’re producing more and more toxic antimony over time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So why are components that leach toxic metals being used in disposable e-cigarettes? “We can only speculate,” Poulin says, “but because they’re not reused, disposable e-cigarettes are only designed to be used through their life cycle, which can be anywhere between between 500 to several thousand puffs. You end up with a lot of cheap components, like a lead-based alloy.” He says it’s unclear why manufacturers are using these lower-quality parts, but says “it could be that there’s incentive to make cheaper products, and so they’re using materials that are cheaper in them, instead of something like stainless steel or a higher-quality metallic component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The researchers tested flavored and “clear” versions of three of the most popular products — Esco Bar, Flum Pebble, and ELF Bar — and found “excessive emissions of toxic metallic elements” in the aerosols from each of them. Currently, there are nearly 100 disposable e-cigarette brands on the market, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://digitalmedia.hhs.gov/tobacco/hosted/E-Cigarettes-Authorized-FDA-JAN2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;only authorized&lt;/a&gt; four products: NJOY DAILY Rich Tobacco (4.5 percent and 6 percent) and NJOY DAILY EXTRA Menthol (4.5 percent and 6 percent). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The manufacturers of Flum Pebble and Elf Bar did not immediately respond to our request for comment. A spokesperson for Eco Bar sent &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; the following statement: “The test that was conducted was not on an original EscoBar vape. It’s important for the researcher to understand that the market is flooded with counterfeit products from China. These fake vapes are typically untested and uncertified, and they are the ones that often show such irregularities. All of our vapes are lab-tested and fully approved.”

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To assess whether the concentrations of toxic metals in these three disposable e-cigarettes would be of concern for human &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/health/" id="auto-tag_health" data-tag="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, Salazar did a risk assessment based on an estimate of how much people typically use these devices, using 100 puffs per day as a benchmark — which Poulin says is “actually pretty conservative based on known use patterns.” From there, you can figure out how much toxic metal a smoker was exposed to. Lead, nickel, and antimony were all above the threshold of being safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To help put things in perspective, the researchers compared the health risks of disposable e-cigarettes to other types of smoking, and found that Esco Bar devices released more lead during a day’s use than 19 packs of traditional cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	What does this mean for disposable e-cigarette smokers’ health? “Nickel and antimony are respiratory carcinogens, so they can be essentially driving not just inflammation of the lungs, but also cancer,” Poulin says. “Lead is a potent neurotoxin, and our concern is that [disposable e-cigarettes] are often flavored devices, and they’re marketed towards youth. The concern is that adolescents and teens could be exposed to high levels of lead at a time when their neurological systems are developing.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Smoking disposable e-cigarettes may also cause lung fibrosis, Salazar says, but that would likely happen further down the line. “These disposables have only been on the market for maybe about five, six years, and a lot of these diseases take years — maybe decades — to manifest,” he explains. “So we’re not entirely sure what the long-term effects are going to be, but from the data that we have presented, we see that there is potential for concern here.”&lt;/p&gt;

Is Greta Thunberg the literal antichrist? Are the three predominant ideological schools in Europe environmentalism, "Islamic Shariah law" and "Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover"? Is AI "woke" and capable of following Elon Musk to Mars? Peter seems to think so! Perhaps the "just asking questions" school of journalism could add "&lt;em&gt;hey, what the fuck are you talking about&lt;/em&gt;" to its repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, many of these assertions fall squarely into the realm of things that exist within Thiel's mind palace rather than verifiable facts, with at least one notable exception. Relatively early in their chat, Peter tells Ross the following [emphasis ours]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at biotech, something like dementia, Alzheimer’s — &lt;strong&gt;we’ve made zero progress in 40 to 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;. People are completely stuck on beta amyloids. It’s obviously not working. It’s just some kind of a stupid racket where the people are just reinforcing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty bold claim! It's also completely untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no treatment 40 or 50 years ago for Alzheimer's disease," Sterling Johnson, a professor of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told Engadget. "What we've been able to do in the last 20 years has been actually pretty extraordinary. We've developed markers that help us identify when this disease starts, using the using amyloid markers and tau biomarkers, we know that the disease actually begins 20 years before the symptoms do, and that is a critical thing to know if we are going to prevent this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Alzheimer's remains incurable. But the absence of a miracle cure does not negate the accomplishments thus far in detection and prevention. "The first treatments were these window dressing treatments. It's like treating the symptoms like you would treat a cold [...] The first generation of amyloid therapy was that kind of approach where it just addressed the symptoms by amping up the neurons and increasing the neurotransmitters available to the to the brain cells." Johnson, whose team runs one of the largest and longest &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://wrap.wisc.edu/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on people at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, added, "Now we have opportunities to actually modify the disease biology through the amyloid pathway, but also we're focused on the other proteinopathy — which is &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauopathy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; — and there's clinical trials underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiel, a well-known advocate for advancements in radical life extension (including a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood?srsltid=AfmBOorWPpJna-9f4HpVxwkhBkh_6IbM-7PPlpHzAhmc5HoK02GTRv4s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; interest in injecting himself with the blood of young people) sees the state of scientific research in this area as sluggish and risk averse. But the groundbreaking work is happening at this moment. Professor Johnson pointed to a monoclonal antibody called &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/roche-alzheimer-drug-could-prevent-onset/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gantenerumab;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt;. In an early test of 73 participants with inherited mutations that would cause them to overproduce amyloid in the brain, it cut the number of participants who developed Alzheimer's symptoms practically in half. "The big phase-three prevention trials are happening right now." Those are using lecanemab and donanemab, two other monoclonal treatments, which Johnson clarified are "already known to be better than gantenerumab at clearing out beta-amyloid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who fashions himself as a heterodox thinker, Thiel certainly seems to have stumbled on a remarkably similar talking point to current Trump administration FDA head Robert F Kennedy Jr. "Alzheimer's is a very, very good example of how [National Institute of Health] has gone off the rails over the past 20 years ago with research on amyloid plaques" Kennedy &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DzkPRscLkpQ?si=PS-Qgx5bZFIrVGxG&amp;amp;t=1319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a Department of Health budgetary hearing last month.

Participants who took the supplement daily for two months showed significant improvements in several domains of memory and spatial reasoning compared to those who took a placebo. The supplement was also well-tolerated, with no significant side effects reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, refers to a decline in memory or thinking skills that is noticeable but does not yet interfere significantly with daily life. People with MCI are at a higher risk of developing dementia later in life, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no approved medications specifically for treating MCI, and many people turn to lifestyle interventions such as exercise, diet changes, and cognitive training to slow cognitive decline. Herbal supplements have also gained attention, with ashwagandha — a plant long used in traditional Indian medicine — often recommended for stress, anxiety, and cognitive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha, also known by its botanical name &lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;, has a long history of use in Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India. Recent research has suggested that its compounds may have neuroprotective properties. In particular, Sominone — a metabolite derived from one of the plant’s active constituents — has shown promise in animal studies. It has been found to support the growth of nerve cells, protect neurons from damage, and enhance memory performance. The current study was designed to test whether a standardized extract of ashwagandha containing Sominone (called Somin-On™) could produce similar effects in humans diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study at a medical center in Jhansi, India. A total of 40 adults with MCI were selected to participate after meeting specific inclusion criteria. Participants were between the ages of 25 and 65 and had mild memory problems as measured by common clinical tests. They were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of Somin-On™ or a placebo capsule once daily for 60 days. Both participants and researchers were unaware of who received the treatment and who received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several standardized tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III), and the Shepard Mental Rotation Task. These assessments were administered at the beginning of the study, halfway through, and again at the end. The researchers focused on changes in immediate memory, general memory, working memory, attention, and visuospatial processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Compared to those taking a placebo, participants in the Somin-On™ group showed consistent and statistically significant improvements across nearly all domains tested. Improvements were already evident after 30 days of treatment and became more pronounced by the end of the 60-day study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shepard Mental Rotation Task, which assesses spatial reasoning and mental imagery, showed a 12% increase in performance at 30 days and a 32% increase at 60 days among those taking Somin-On™, while the placebo group showed a decline by the end of the study. Similar trends were seen in the Wechsler Memory Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In measures of immediate memory, participants taking the supplement improved by about 7% at 60 days, while those in the placebo group actually declined slightly. General memory scores rose nearly 15% in the treatment group, compared to only a small increase in the placebo group. Working memory improved by over 18% in those taking Somin-On™, with negligible change in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two widely used screening tools, MoCA and MMSE, also showed marked improvement. MoCA scores in the treatment group rose nearly 15% from baseline, and MMSE scores increased by more than 19%. Both improvements were significantly higher than those observed in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement was also well-tolerated. No participants in either group reported any adverse side effects, and standard blood tests and liver and kidney function markers remained stable throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the cognitive benefits of Somin-On™ may stem from its neuroprotective mechanisms. Previous animal research has shown that Sominone, the main active ingredient, can enhance the growth of neural connections and reverse memory deficits caused by damage to brain cells. It has also been shown to improve spatial memory and reduce brain cell shrinkage in models of Alzheimer’s disease, without necessarily affecting other markers like amyloid plaques. These findings hint at a potential mode of action involving the growth and maintenance of neural networks, rather than targeting traditional hallmarks of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible mechanisms include increased resistance to oxidative stress, improvements in mitochondrial function, and support for cholinergic signaling — all of which have been linked to memory function in the brain. Inflammation and excitotoxicity, two processes involved in neurodegeneration, have also been shown to be reduced by components of ashwagandha in previous studies. Although the current study did not examine these mechanisms directly, the cognitive improvements observed may reflect the result of one or more of these biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging findings, the study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, with only 40 participants. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results and better understand how widely they apply. Second, the duration of the study was limited to two months. It is unclear whether the benefits of Somin-On™ persist over a longer period or whether the supplement could help prevent further decline. Third, the study did not use imaging techniques or biological markers to assess brain changes, so the underlying processes behind the cognitive improvements remain speculative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the absence of an active comparator group. The study compared Somin-On™ to a placebo, but did not compare it to other forms of ashwagandha or to other cognitive-enhancing treatments. Since ashwagandha contains multiple bioactive compounds, future studies could investigate whether Sominone alone is responsible for the observed benefits or if the effects arise from a broader mix of constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future trials should include a more diverse participant pool, longer follow-up, and potentially integrate imaging or biomarker data to explore how ashwagandha affects brain structure and function. It would also be valuable to test the supplement in combination with other non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as cognitive training or physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251324377" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract with Sominone (Somin-On™) to improve memory in adults with mild cognitive impairment: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hari Prakash Rai and Deo Nidhi Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:04:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQW9pQ0NQYTFrOEQtQnFiTEtPVnRRS09MVWVuXzlmb1pEM282Q1hCUUJtaXNBSHFzZG5FTGFRWjQwN3RTV2dkVU1SakJ6VU54U19OT2hKQ24wc1hBOEZJZmlUU2ZoQVN0Z2c2NnBXalpyUTU1eHpQWjdoYUV2N2dvVEF4aVI4WlZfeXdFc3ppTmQ0MGRqOUdGT1Y5cDJsZUJhSHhCZ0hVVTdReGZ5cHNnenVaWlFVbjNaemo5eUtiNkEtbHM</guid></item><item><title>什么是硫柳汞？研究对RFK Jr.抨击下的疫苗防腐剂的评价- PBS | What is thimerosal?

&lt;p&gt;During the first meeting of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recently downsized vaccine panel, the group voted to stop recommending flu vaccines containing thimerosal, a vaccine preservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lengthy &lt;a href="https://archive.fo/ZbCAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;June 24 X post&lt;/a&gt; that preceded the meeting, Kennedy, who spent two decades as an antivaccine movement leader, described thimerosal using terms such as “toxic” and said hundreds of studies identify it as a carcinogenic “potent neurotoxin.” He also said there are high doses of mercury in flu shots recommended to pregnant women and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/acip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;’ two-day meeting on June 25 and 26 included &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-jr#:~:text=A%20key%20vaccine%20advisory%20panel,anti%2Dvaccine%20activists%20for%20decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;discussion of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; containing thimerosal before its vote on flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACIP is an independent group that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;provides vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; the CDC director reviews and decides whether to formally adopt. Earlier in June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; 17 ACIP members, replacing them with seven new members, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/11/rfk-cdc-vaccine-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; people who’ve &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;expressed doubt about vaccine efficacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/06/who-robert-malone-joe-rogans-guest-was-vaccine-sci/"&gt;promoted antivaccine falsehoods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists who study vaccines have been researching thimerosal’s use for decades. Here’s what to know about the vaccine preservative and its removal from flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used in some vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people — particularly those who are pregnant or breastfeeding — encounter &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-and-fish/art-20044185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; consuming mercury, such as in seafood. But those warnings are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;methylmercury&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in certain kinds of fish and is known to be toxic to people when consumed at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal contains ethylmercury — a single-letter difference that might not sound significant, but is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human bodies can break down and excrete ethylmercury quickly, meaning it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to cause harm. By contrast, methylmercury is more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;accumulate&lt;/a&gt; in the body and cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vaccines, thimerosal is added to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;prevent harmful microbes&lt;/a&gt; such as bacteria and fungi from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing in vaccine vials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration,” the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt; said. “Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal has been at the heart of Kennedy’s antivaccine activism for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-environmental-toxins-cause-autism"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Fact-checking RFK Jr.’s claim that environmental toxins cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Kennedy wrote an article co-published by Rolling Stone and Salon that alleged leading health agencies including the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration had colluded with vaccine manufacturers to conceal a study that found thimerosal “may have caused autism in thousands of kids.” Scientists and researchers &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-campaign-of-conspiracy-theori/"&gt;said Kennedy’s argument&lt;/a&gt; was inaccurate and misleading. Continued research has found no link between thimerosal and autism. Kennedy’s article &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rolling-stone-retracts-autism-article-but-lots-of-junk-journalism-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;was removed from Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Salon retracted&lt;/a&gt; it in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Kennedy wrote a book opposing thimerosal’s use in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Which vaccines use thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All vaccines the CDC &lt;a href="https://aap2.silverchair-cdn.com/aap2/content_public/cms/resources/15585/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;routinely recommends&lt;/a&gt; for children age 6 or younger are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;available without thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children receiving the routine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pediatric vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; “can get completely immunized without any thimerosal-containing vaccines,” said Dr. Mark Sawyer, a pediatrics professor at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and a pediatric infectious disease physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some childhood vaccines &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have never contained&lt;/a&gt; thimerosal. These include the measles, mumps, rubella or MMR vaccine, the varicella or chickenpox vaccine, the inactivated polio vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from most vaccines — including all childhood vaccines — as of 2001, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is still used in vaccines today, but not as widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservative is in only a small fraction of influenza vaccine vials, specifically the multi-dose vials that constitute a small portion of the U.S. flu shot supply, Dr. Jake Scott told PolitiFact. Scott is a Stanford University School of Medicine infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA said &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135735/https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;thimerosal use has declined&lt;/a&gt; as vaccine manufacturers have developed more single-dose vaccines that do not require preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott said the CDC lists 12 influenza vaccine formulations for the 2024 to 2025 flu season, which will also cover the 2025 to 2026 season because no new flu vaccines have been licensed. Of those 12 vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just three&lt;/a&gt; are multi-dose vaccines that contain thimerosal at 25 micrograms — equal to 25 millionths of a gram — per dose, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC’s supply data shows single-dose, thimerosal-free syringes &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-to-know-about-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-from-bygone-flu-shot-debate#:~:text=Why%20is%20thimerosal%20controversial?,and%20replaces%20expert%20former%20members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;make up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/acip-recommends-adults-receive-seasonal-single-dose-influenza-vaccines-free-of-thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about 96%&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. flu vaccine supply, leaving roughly 4% as multi-dose vials, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Single-dose syringes are the default for pediatrics and prenatal care, so real-world exposure is even lower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because flu vaccines with thimerosal constitute a small portion of the influenza vaccine supply, public health experts told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/26/rfk-jr-acip-thimerosal-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s vote to stop recommending them would have a limited impact, although it could make flu shots more expensive and less accessible in some parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does research show about thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because antivaccine activists’ focus has centered on whether thimerosal causes autism, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/197365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595043/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/126/4/656/65633/Prenatal-and-Infant-Exposure-to-Thimerosal-From?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; investigated a potential link and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10997/chapter/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;no causal relationship&lt;/a&gt; between the preservative and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists evaluated thimerosal’s potential impacts and risks they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine researchers told PolitiFact that thimerosal was removed from vaccines out of an abundance of caution, not because research proved that thimerosal was unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was removed from vaccines because people thought it might cause problems, said Rachel Roper, a microbiology and immunology professor at East Carolina University. But ultimately, “studies were done and it was shown to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no evidence to-date that thimerosal “causes any harm whatsoever,” Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bilious blowout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors noted that his breath was fast and shallow, with crackling in his neck. But breathing sounds from the base of his right lung were quiet. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the problems. There was air in his chest space and into his neck. Fluid was also building up around his lungs, and his right lung was collapsing. The scan also showed a perforation in the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors inserted a chest tube to remove the fluid, which did not include gastric contents, suggesting the fluid build-up was from chest inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors then did an additional X-ray exam of the esophagus using a water-soluble contrast agent. This clearly revealed a large gash in the man's esophagus resulting from the robust eruption. The imaging also showed the contrast agent leaking out into the man's chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors quickly sent the man into emergency surgery to repair his esophagus. He spent the next 35 days in the hospital recovering. When he was discharged, he still had a feeding tube that passed through his nose and into his small intestine. It took an additional three months for the perforation to completely heal, at which point doctors could finally remove the feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear what causes Boerhaave syndrome. Researchers hypothesize that it occurs from a loss of neuromuscular coordination, which, in particular, causes the upper sphincter in the esophagus—the cricopharyngeus—to fail to relax at the onset of vomiting. The rapid rise of internal pressure overwhelms the esophagus, typically causing a lengthwise tear in the lower third of the tube, which is the weakest portion. On average, tears can be up to 8 centimeters (about 3 inches) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though researchers expect that cases are underreported, the estimated incidence based on reports is about three cases per million people globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve spent any time on social media lately, you’ve probably seen &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-when-you-wake-up-for-healthy-cortisol-levels-8784363" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; blamed for everything from visceral fat to burnout and sleepless nights. While it’s true that this stress hormone plays a role in how you feel, cortisol is essential for many everyday functions. “It helps regulate your body’s stress response, blood sugar, metabolism, inflammation and even your sleep-wake cycle,” says &lt;a href="https://rootfunctionalmedicine.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erica Armstrong, M.D., IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key is to keep cortisol in a healthy range, which healthy adrenal glands manage all on their own. If cortisol levels become too high for too long, you may start to notice some unpleasant side effects, and your health could be at risk. To untangle fact from fiction when it comes to cortisol, we spoke with physicians to understand what this stress hormone does, how to spot when it might be out of balance and steps you can take to manage inflammation and feel your best.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cortisol is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands that plays an essential role in your health,” says Armstrong. This hormone naturally follows a 24-hour cycle, peaking 30 minutes after waking up, and declining during the day, with the lowest levels occurring during the early phases of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and surges during times of high stress. A burst of cortisol leads to high amounts of sugar released into the bloodstream for extra energy, vasoconstriction and increased heart rate to get your body ready for the “fight or flight” response.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This response is useful in a situation when you need to move or act quickly, but can create problems when it occurs too frequently, and without the follow-up of physical action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most cells in the body have cortisol receptors, meaning that this stress hormone impacts everything from your heart to your brain, metabolism, immune system and more. Chronically high cortisol levels are a biomarker for a number of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of the most common causes for elevated cortisol include chronic stress, insulin resistance, autoimmune diseases and Cushing’s syndrome, explains Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-signs-your-cortisol-may-be-high"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Signs Your Cortisol May Be High &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The only way to know if you have high cortisol levels is to see a medical professional.  “We always combine symptoms with lab testing (like a 4-point saliva cortisol test) and a full clinical picture before concluding whether cortisol is truly out of balance,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, these are some of the most common signs of high cortisol: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have trouble falling asleep at night or tend to wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep, it could have something to do with your stress hormones. “Cortisol should be low at night, but if it's spiking due to stress or blood sugar dips, it can wake you up in the middle of the night,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study of healthy individuals found that higher pre-sleep cortisol levels were associated with shorter and poorer sleep quality than lower pre-sleep cortisol levels.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A similar connection was also found among people with type 2 diabetes. Left unaddressed, poor sleep quality and short duration can lead to a number of health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease and all-cause mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You start gaining weight around your abdomen &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself holding on to extra weight around your midsection, despite no changes in your diet or exercise routines, it could be a sign of high cortisol levels. In one study of middle-aged and older adults, those with higher levels of hair cortisol were more likely to have a higher body weight and waist circumference than those with lower levels.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  “Cortisol promotes fat storage, especially around the midsection, as a survival mechanism,” says Armstrong. While the chances of elevated cortisol are higher in those with abdominal obesity, many people who may fall on the obesity scale do not have elevated cortisol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You feel “tired but wired”  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol helps your brain stay ready for impending danger, which can feel downright exhausting when you’re stuck in that state for too long. “Elevated cortisol can make you feel mentally alert even when you’re physically exhausted,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, even if you’re feeling mentally wired, chances are your brain isn’t operating at its best. High levels of cortisol, maintained over long periods, are associated with reduced cognitive function and impaired sleep, which can further impair mental functions such as memory and attention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-managing-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Managing Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working to lower elevated cortisol levels can help reduce chronic inflammation and the risk of inflammatory diseases. Here are other expert-approved ways to manage inflammation: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow an anti-inflammatory diet:&lt;/strong&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables and fiber-rich legumes can help support your body’s natural ability to regulate inflammation and stress. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to balance your blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stabilizing blood sugar through regular meals with protein, fat and fiber can calm both inflammation and cortisol spikes,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: Managing your mental, emotional and physical stress with adequate rest and prioritizing mental health and self-care activities can help reduce stress and inflammation. Research supports the use of mindfulness, meditation and relaxation interventions as effective ways to manage and lower cortisol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: “Even one night of poor sleep can elevate inflammatory markers,” says Armstrong. As inconsistent sleep is highly associated with inflammation, creating and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule and routine should be a top priority in your inflammation management plan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your gut health&lt;/strong&gt;: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating your immune system and controlling inflammation. “Addressing microbiome imbalances, food sensitivities, or underlying infections through personalized protocols can dramatically reduce systemic inflammation,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When operating correctly, your body has systems in place to regulate cortisol production and release for an appropriate stress response. So while most people do not have to worry about elevated cortisol, chronically high levels can cause unwanted side effects and increase the risk of inflammatory and metabolic health conditions. Difficulty sleeping, abdominal weight gain and feeling mentally wired but physically tired can indicate elevated cortisol levels; however, these symptoms could also be caused by a variety of other health conditions or imbalances. The best way to know for sure is to speak with a healthcare provider.

But for men with azoospermia, which causes extremely low sperm counts, the sperm is difficult to find and can be damaged through existing methods of searching for viable cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3AR7HBUJNG6ZOO7MQ3JDGT6BM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Zev Williams, director of Columbia’s fertility program, said that identifying viable cells can take hours or days of searching under a microscope and often results in no usable sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MFA2RZBFU5GTJBZ5EX4HL6FQTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Labs searched for two days and found nothing,” said Williams. “We ran the same sample and found 44 sperm within an hour.

As the sample flows, it is illuminated and imaged by a microscope linked to a high-speed camera. The system captures millions of individual frames. Artificial intelligence then analyzes these images in real time, scanning for the presence of sperm and then, within milliseconds, isolating that sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KLSQJ2M5BNDPRG4ACL7Q4NIMBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once isolated, the sperm can be frozen for future use or used in IVF through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg.

Embryologists can spend hours manually scanning a semen sample in hopes of spotting a viable sperm cell. In other cases, surgeons perform procedures to search for sperm directly from the testicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BD7YYBF23BH7VOKPYT7YIW2U6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These surgeries can be painful, carry risks and are not always successful. Some lab techniques use stains, dyes or lasers to help identify cells, but these substances can be toxic to sperm and make them unusable for fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PSF36ELQRBFBBHGP7MC3BZTGLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This could help some men avoid surgery altogether,” said Allison K.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insulin resistance is when your cells begin to lose their ability to use insulin efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forty percent of young and middle-aged U.S. adults have this condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many supplements sold to improve insulin resistance may make it worse or be dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four out of 10 U.S. adults ages 18 to 44 have insulin resistance—and most don’t even know it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But what is insulin resistance, anyway? This condition is when your cells begin to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;develop a tolerance to insulin&lt;/a&gt;, the hormone needed to push glucose into your cells for energy. When insulin doesn’t work as well as it used to, your pancreas responds by trying to make more of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a while, your body can compensate for this additional need until the pancreas struggles to produce the insulin required to keep cells energized. However, if it continues for long enough, it can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lead to prediabetes and eventually type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, if you have type 2 diabetes, you already have insulin resistance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s not clear exactly why insulin resistance happens, genetics and age are believed to play a role. It has also been &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7901433/surprising-link-between-chronic-inflammation-obesity/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked to overweight and obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Managing insulin resistance requires changes in lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, especially increasing physical activity to “use up” blood sugar. Recommended strategies may also include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;weight loss to reach a healthy body weight&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body use its insulin effectively. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have insulin resistance—or are worried about developing it—you might be considering &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-for-metabolic-syndrome-11757613" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplements that claim to help manage this condition&lt;/a&gt;. But are they really effective? When it comes to many of them, the answer is no. Here are five supplements experts say you’re better off avoiding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-st-johns-wort"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. St. John’s Wort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; St. John’s wort is a shrub that’s used as a supplement to treat depression and symptoms of menopause.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it may pose problems for people with insulin resistance. Although no medications are approved to specifically treat insulin resistance, you may be on medications like metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones if you have diabetes. However, combining St. John’s wort with these drugs can be a problem. “It can decrease the efficacy of these medications and lead to higher blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-katz-rd-cdces-9889b863/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lizzy Katz, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes program coordinator at the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same time, diabetes and depression often overlap, says the American Diabetes Association.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’re struggling with your mental health, talk to your health care practitioner about safe treatment for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-gymnema"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Gymnema &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gymnema is a plant that has been studied for the treatment of diabetes. “However, there is insufficient reliable evidence of this—and even a risk for hypoglycemia,” says Katz. In fact, most of the research on this supplement has been conducted in animals, and even those studies conclude it shouldn’t be recommended for preventing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The National Institutes of Health agrees, adding that the current research on gymnema is lacking, and combined with other supplements, it may be especially dangerous.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, if you are taking insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, you should avoid gymnema due to potential interactions, Katz advises.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-bcaas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. BCAAs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs is short for branched-chain amino acids. These &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein building blocks&lt;/a&gt; are naturally found in foods. They are also sold in unnaturally large quantities as supplements advertised for muscle-building and improving results at the gym.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For that reason, many people take them before a workout. This supplement is one that people with insulin resistance should avoid, cautions &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been some links to BCAAs worsening insulin resistance,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yes, exercise is important for treating insulin resistance. But you can reap its benefits without popping a supplement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-omega-3-fats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Omega-3 Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 fats, like DHA and EPA&lt;/a&gt;, are mainly found in fatty fish, such as salmon and sardines. But they’re also a popular supplement. If you have insulin resistance, this is one to talk to your provider about before adding it to your routine. “It’s been shown as likely ineffective for managing diabetes, and [there’s] not enough evidence for treatment of diabetic nephropathy,” says Katz. (Diabetic nephropathy is a kidney disease that can result as a complication of diabetes.) Plus, the research on omega-3s and insulin resistance is mixed. While some studies have found omega-3s may help lower fasting blood glucose and protect against insulin resistance, other research suggests they may raise blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are on certain antidiabetes medications like insulin secretagogues, there may also be a risk of low blood sugar, adds Katz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cinnamon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cinnamon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-cinnamon-interacts-with-your-meds-11711435" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cinnamon is heavily marketed for diabetes control&lt;/a&gt; and insulin resistance. One review of 16 studies even showed that cinnamon supplementation helped lower fasting blood sugar and insulin resistance in people with diabetes, says Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But before you get too excited, she points out that the studies used in this analysis are severely limited, as they differed in dosage, length of treatment and type of participant. That means we need larger trials and a standardized formula to determine the exact type of cinnamon supplement and protocol that’s actually effective. Until then, skip the cinnamon supplements. But feel free to go ahead and sprinkle some cinnamon onto your food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-improve-insulin-resistance-without-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Improve Insulin Resistance Without Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the most part, you don’t need supplements if you have insulin resistance. Your health care provider might recommend supplements in certain situations, such as an iron supplement if blood tests reveal you have anemia, says Gomer. But when it comes to insulin resistance specifically, experts recommend focusing on these healthy lifestyle habits instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prioritize Protein&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“Protein will help keep you full,” says Gomer. So, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7821676/protein-nation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;filling up on protein&lt;/a&gt; may also help you avoid overeating. That can help you maintain a healthy body weight, which is one of the best things you can do to manage blood sugar and reduce insulin resistance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile on the Veggies: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your plate is also filled with nonstarchy vegetables. They’re naturally low in carbs, plus their ample fiber slows down carbohydrate absorption and promotes satiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active: &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7915267/best-time-of-day-to-exercise/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Regular exercise is a great component&lt;/a&gt; to focus on because it can improve insulin resistance in the short and long term,” says Katz. That’s because exercise prompts muscles to use up blood sugar as fuel, reducing glucose levels. It can also help cells become more insulin sensitive. Aim for a total of 150 minutes of physical activity per week. You can break that down however you like, whether it’s five 30-minute walks or 15 10-minute movement breaks throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a Healthy Body Weight: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the American Diabetes Association, even modest weight loss can help reduce insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have insulin resistance or simply want to prevent this condition from sneaking up on you, consider connecting with a registered dietitian, especially one who specializes in diabetes care. They can help you develop a weight-loss plan that’s best suited for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’ve been told you have insulin resistance or are worried about developing it, you may be considering a supplement. However, health experts caution against self-treating with supplements, especially St. John’s wort, gymnema, BCAAs, omega-3 fats and cinnamon. While you may have heard these can help manage insulin resistance, they may be useless or, in some cases, even dangerous. Instead, think lifestyle changes like exercise, a protein- and fiber-rich eating plan and weight loss, if indicated. These all have a solid, proven track record for improving insulin resistance. However, if you’re still concerned, speak with your health care practitioner.

      &lt;p&gt;BAYFIELD COUNTY — A person in northern Wisconsin has died after contracting a tick-borne virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayfield County Health Department said the patient died from the Powassan virus in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The patient who died was one of three people who have contracted the virus so far this year in Wisconsin, and all three were hospitalized, the state's Department of Health Services said in a June 24 bulletin issued to health care providers and health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spread by the blacklegged tick, commonly referred to as a deer tick, and symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting and generalized weakness, DHS said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The agency said it can also progress to encephalitis — with symptoms like altered mental states, seizures, speech and movement problems, and paralysis — or meningitis — with symptoms like severe headaches, sensitivity to light and neck rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1 out of 10 people with a severe case die, and half of those with a severe case are left with long-term health problems like memory loss and recurring headaches, according to the 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The DHS said risk factors for neurologic disease from the Powassan virus include those with compromised immune systems, as well as children and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy laws, DHS declined to share the age of the patient who died in Bayfield County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no treatment or vaccine for the virus. The DHS urged people to use tick repellent, check for and remove ticks before they can bite and avoid wooded and bushy areas where the virus is found.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cases of Powassan 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/northland-outdoors/tick-borne-powassan-virus-creeps-into-minnesota" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;
    
       in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Minnesota reported 14 cases in 2024 and Wisconsin reported 12 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the number of cases is up is unclear, but there are more deer — the blacklegged tick's preferred host — and more people living near wooded areas with ticks, the News Tribune reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS said ticks become infected with Powassan when they bite and consume the blood of an infected skunk, groundhog, squirrel, mouse, or other rodent. However, the exact source of the virus remains unknown. Ticks can also be born with Powassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was first identified in Wisconsin in 2003. From 2003 to 2024, 67 cases were detected in the state, primarily in the northern region,

The advice makes sense — maybe it really is that tempting screen that’s keeping you up — and yet many people say they can’t fall asleep without scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of those people, you’re in luck. According to &lt;a href="https://sleepcycle.com/science-of-sleep/a-sleep-cycle-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Dr. Michael Gradisar&lt;/a&gt;, the head of sleep science at &lt;a href="https://sleepcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Sleep Cycle&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t feel the need to force yourself to turn off your devices and lie in bed in abject silence. In fact, your phone might even help you drift off to dreamland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some experts say blue light from screens &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-does-cell-phone-blue-light-mess-with-your-sleep-a-new-study-shows-how-your-eye-cells-respond-to-it-13226431" class="T3D"&gt;disrupts your sleep by suppressing melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, Gradisar says this advice is actually &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25535358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;based on a study&lt;/a&gt; that exposed participants to abnormally intense levels of it. “Over time, it became simplified into a broad recommendation,” he tells Bustle. “It’s one of the most persistent myths in sleep science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, he published &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews &lt;/em&gt;showing that blue light from everyday devices simply isn’t bright enough to affect your sleep in a meaningful way. “For context, the screens we use at night typically &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-health/parameters/quality/blue-light-devices-not-sleep-stealer-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;emit light under 80 lux&lt;/a&gt;, while significant circadian shifts usually require exposure to light intensities around 500 lux or more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/how-to-sleep-through-the-night-sleep-consultation" class="T3D"&gt;getting a good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt; is less about ditching your devices and more about how you use them in the hours before you snooze. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phones In Bed? Seriously?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to scroll, play a podcast, or even watch TV before bed, don’t hold back. For many people, enjoying some pre-sleep screen time might even be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a phone or having background noise from the TV helps quiet the mind, especially if your thoughts tend to spiral when the room goes silent,” Gradisar says. “In sleep science, we often see that the real barrier to falling asleep isn’t the screen or the light, but racing thoughts, worry, or stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relaxing with your phone goes a long way. “That distraction can actually reduce cognitive arousal, which is a key factor in insomnia,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scrolling can quickly become a coping tool, and one that does make it easier to fall asleep, Gradisar recommends investigating the root cause of your sleep issues, whether it’s stress-related or a circadian rhythm issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sWr iGR CEt"&gt;&lt;figure class="Qf5 E1M"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figcaption class="rv9 TrI"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Manu Vega/Moment/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re lying awake each night and blaming your phone, it might be time to look deeper,” he says. “Phones may be part of your bedtime routine, but they’re rarely the core problem. Instead, it’s often your thoughts, your stress levels, or your internal clock that need attention.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other researchers, Gradisar conducted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;a comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt; of nearly a dozen experimental studies about whether blue light from screens meaningfully affected sleep. They found that screens aren’t the sleep villain they’re made out to be. What’s really impacting your rest is staying up too late. “It’s a behavioral issue,” he says. “Not a biological one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips For Lulling Yourself To Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="sWr iGR CEt"&gt;&lt;figure class="Qf5 E1M"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figcaption class="rv9 TrI"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Olga Pankova/Moment/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all screen time is equal. “Don’t scroll endlessly, stress over emails, or chase one more episode deep into the night,” he says. Instead, browse a soothing subreddit, organize a Pinterest board, or play a simple game, and limit yourself to just one device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can prop up your phone, even better. The less you tap your screen, he says, the more likely you are to relax into sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Try not to start anything too stimulating close to bedtime, and ideally, aim to protect your sleep window,” he says. “At the end of the day, it’s not about eliminating screens. It’s about being intentional with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studies referenced:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bauducco, S., Pillion, M., Bartel, K., Reynolds, C., Kahn, M., &amp;amp; Gradisar, M.

Supplements work, yet many communities lack steady access, and cost is sometimes a prohibitive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pseudo-b12-from-spirulina-microalgae"&gt;Pseudo-B12 from Spirulina microalgae&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular Spirulina mainly carries pseudo‑B12, a look‑alike molecule that our cells ignore. The Iceland project used tuned LED lighting to flip the alga’s own genes toward making methylcobalamin, the active form that humans can absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory assays put the new strain’s B12 at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, which is comfortably above the 0.7‑1.5 µg/100 g window quoted for beef in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 98 percent of that total was active B12, not pseudo, ending a long‑standing barrier for microalgae‑based nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call the product “Photosynthetically Controlled Spirulina,” or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33566210/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PCS&lt;/a&gt;. They achieved the upgrade without genetic modification, relying instead on light spectra that boost a native metabolic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-spirulina-with-b-12-vitamins"&gt;Creating Spirulina with B-12 vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pathways ran inside flat‑panel photobioreactor walls that were kept at about 88 °F (31 °C), aerated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032119305398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GEOTHERMAL carbon‑dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and powered by Iceland’s near‑total renewable electric grid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closed system blocks contamination and uses minimal freshwater, an important edge over open ponds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS stayed carbon neutral because every kilowatt came from hydro or geothermal turbines, and harvested biomass trapped the same amount of carbon that the process emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides B12, PCS in Spirulina microalgae delivers roughly 27 grams of protein and 0.03 grams of iron per 100 grams, a profile that tracks or beats lean steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/page-files/Vitamin%20B-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USDA tables&lt;/a&gt; show beef cuts can swing from 0.8 to about 4 micrograms of B12 per 100 grams, depending on the muscle and cooking method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vitamin B12 levels at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, Spirulina is also a comparable source of this essential vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is light in fat, contains no cholesterol, and is naturally salt free, making it easier to incorporate into heart-friendly diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings demonstrate that photosynthetically controlled Spirulina can produce desirable levels of active vitamin B12, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional animal‑source foods,” confirmed Dr. Tzachor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef production averages about 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sharks-may-benefit-from-rising-temperatures-but-not-from-rising-co2/"&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‑equivalent emissions for every kilogram of meat, the highest of any staple protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PCS cultivation is powered by renewables, swapping a kilogram of steak for an equal mass of algae could erase more than 60 kilograms (130 pounds) of greenhouse gas from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper sketches a country‑wide scale‑up: diverting electricity that is now used by heavy industry could let Iceland ship 278 thousand tons of PCS a year, enough active B12 to meet the daily needs of nearly 14 million toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a smaller rollout could plug critical gaps in areas where deficiency and childhood stunting overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS ships as a shelf‑stable powder that blends into flour, beverages, or nutrition bars, trimming cold‑chain costs that hinder meat or milk aid. Because it is an autotroph, it sidesteps the feed, land, and water burdens that shadow livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-b12-rich-spirulina-and-food-policy"&gt;B12-rich Spirulina and food policy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS could also shift how governments approach &lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;ood security and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/malnutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Because the production system is modular and closed-loop, it can be deployed in regions with poor soil, unreliable rainfall, or limited farmland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opens the door to building local microalgae facilities in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/which-dietary-changes-are-best-for-cancer-prevention/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; deficiency is most severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If validated at scale, PCS could also influence agricultural subsidies and international food aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations might begin to classify Spirulina as a strategic crop, eligible for public investment or included in procurement plans for schools, hospitals, and humanitarian agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would mark a rare crossover between biotech innovation and public nutrition policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical teams still have to confirm how well humans absorb the algae‑bound &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; compared with pills or steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are being designed to track blood markers, nerve function, and taste acceptance across a two‑year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers also need to soften PCS’s distinctive color and aroma for picky eaters, especially children. Early tests suggest microencapsulation or partial extraction can hide the hue without stripping the nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-024-00152-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anal cancer is on the rise, with specialist Dr. Evan Goldstein sharing a little-known warning sign that can increase the risk, which he dubs a 'silent disease'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nine out of 10 HPV infections go away on their own,&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anal-cancer#:~:text=Anal%20Cancer%20Causes&amp;amp;text=HPV%20is%20the%20most%20common,cause%20genital%20and%20anal%20warts."&gt; Johns Hopkins notes&lt;/a&gt; if the infection becomes persistent or more severe due to a weakened immune system, HPV can cause cancers later in life, including anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of developing anal cancer is around one in 500, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/anal-cancer.html"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/a&gt; The site noted that this number was particularly high among white and Hispanic women over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer symptoms can be similar to those of hemorrhoids and anal fissures, sometimes making it harder to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms are bleeding from the anus, itching and pain, as well small lumps around and inside your bottom and a discharge of mucus and inconsistent stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The idea is to catch this early with early detection anal pap smears and full anoscopy with an appropriate anal practitioner,' Dr. Goldstein explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we talk about anal health and standardize yearly evaluations, similar to genecology appointments, the better all of us will be,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldstein often shares information about anal health, revealing a critical mistake people are making after using the toilet, explaining it could lead to serious health issues over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leading proctologist says 'traditional wiping' with toilet paper is causing unnecessary damage and is even more concerned about the popularity of using wet wipes to complete the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Goldstein described anal warts as 'painful and itchy' and said they can 'lead to bleeding' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong"&gt;HuffPost for Am I Doing It Wrong?&lt;/a&gt; Dr Goldstein explained that the skin around the anus is sensitive, and wiping with toilet paper can easily lead to irritation, small tears, and long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a problem that he sees far too often in his clinic, and it's only getting worse as more people rely on wet wipes for a 'cleaner' finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They are so terrible - not only for the environment, but for your hole,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so many companies out there throwing wipes and I think they should all be banned. I see 90 people a week [in my office], and I would say one-third of all the people coming through are coming in from wet wipe-induced issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Goldstein, wet wipes are soaked in chemicals which can disrupt the microbiome of the area, which can lead to bacterial infections and painful skin conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The earlier &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is spotted, the better – for patients, their loved ones, and scientists working toward treatments or a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has found that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in earwax could carry chemical signals of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;the neurological disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work builds on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test"&gt;earlier findings&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="165705" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; subtly alters body odor, through changes in sebum, the oily substance that naturally moisturizes our hair and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with trying to analyze sebum on the skin is that its exposure to air and the external environment makes it less reliable for clinical testing. Scientists led by a team from Zhejiang University wanted to take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-you-should-never-clean-the-wax-in-your-ears"&gt;ear wax&lt;/a&gt; – which is better protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-flips-a-cellular-switch-that-may-slow-aging-scientists-discover?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Flips a Cellular Switch That May Slow Aging, Scientists Discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for Parkinson's disease treatment," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "This study proposes a diagnostic model… that analyzes VOCs from ear canal secretions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15583/jpchrom.2019.014"&gt;Scientists think&lt;/a&gt; those VOCs can be altered by inflammation, cell stress, and neurodegeneration in the brain&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15583/jpchrom.2019.014"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the right tests, the team hypothesized that subtle signals for Parkinson's could show up in the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took ear canal swabs from 209 study participants, 108 of whom had been given a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;Parkinson's disease diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. By charting differences in earwax composition between people with and without Parkinson's, four VOCs stood out: ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165708" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis.jpg" alt="Study Shows It May Be Possible to Screen For Parkinson's Through Your Ear Wax" class="wp-image-165708 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165708" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers &lt;span&gt;identified&lt;/span&gt; specific compounds inside ear wax.

First, though, this same analysis needs to be run on larger groups of people over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then also trained an AI dataset using the same VOC data, producing a tool called an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="165705" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; olfactory system (AIO) that achieved a 94.4 percent accuracy rate in identifying people from the study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-may-be-caused-by-a-common-aquatic-bacterium"&gt;with Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; – a promising start, but only on a small sample of people so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AIO based analytical system underscores its potential for use in bedside medical diagnostic devices, aiding in earlier and more effective treatment for Parkinson's disease patients," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current methods of diagnosing Parkinson's can involve a combination of clinical assessments and brain scans. The new research could potentially lead to a simple ear swab test that could make this diagnostic screening process quicker, cheaper, and capable of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-detects-parkinsons-7-years-before-most-symptoms-show"&gt;picking up Parkinson's earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could also help ongoing study to understand how Parkinson's gets started and how it might be stopped. Identified VOC changes could possibly be used as a chemical fingerprint, identifying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;other changes happening&lt;/a&gt; because of – or perhaps leading to – the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/june/ear-wax-as-a-possible-screening-medium-for-parkinsons-disease.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value," &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/june/ear-wax-as-a-possible-screening-medium-for-parkinsons-disease.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Hao Dong, from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting rid of your persistent fat layers, while gaining girth down under. That's a contemporary equivalent to the fabled fountain of youth, and a special class of weight loss drugs that leverage the GLP-1 hormone - such as Novo Nordisk's Wegovy or Eli Lilly's &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/eli-lilly-and-company-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-is-much-more-effective-than-novo-nordisk/"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; - are now being billed as the conduits for these seemingly miraculous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GLP-1 hormone suppresses hunger and regulates the production of insulin and glucose. After a meal, this hormone raises the level of insulin, which decreases blood glucose levels. Simultaneously, it reduces the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine, creating a feeling of fullness and satiation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's diabetes-geared Ozempic and obesity-focused Wegovy mimic this process by using the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, which binds to the GLP-1 hormone receptor, triggering the hormone in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Diabetes.co.uk, the average penile length in the United Kingdom has increased by 0.46 inches between 2022 and 2024, increasing from 5.17 inches to 5.63 inches over the period. Incidentally, this timeframe also coincides with the launch of Ozempic/Wegovy in the UK and the drug's subsequent rip-roaring popularity, with many A-class celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, jumping onto the proverbial bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reported increase in penile length is also corroborated by several social media anecdotes &lt;a href="https://www.uniladtech.com/science/news/doctor-explains-ozempic-penis-phenomenon-side-effect-004987-20250623"&gt;gathered&lt;/a&gt; by Unilad Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what might be causing male packages to, um, flourish so to say? Well, some speculate that better blood flow to the male nether regions might be responsible for the apparent elongation in penile length. Others, including Dr Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, theorize that this phenomenon might simply be a function of fat removal in the areas adjoining the penis, which would make a given male appendage appear longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic/Wegovy can cause a host of side effects, including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/update-fdas-ongoing-evaluation-reports-suicidal-thoughts-or-actions-patients-taking-certain-type"&gt;possible suicidal ideation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one should never take these drugs without a formal medical recommendation. For those already on GLP-1 drugs though, penile bragging rights might be a hefty ancillary benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
