Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most classic sign of liver distress is a yellow tint, known as Jaundice. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mallikarjun Sakpal, consultant, HPB and transplant physician, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, explained that this occurs when the liver fails to process bilirubin — a waste product from red blood cell breakdown.&lt;/span&gt; “When the liver struggles, bilirubin levels rise, causing a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-gastroenterologist-shares-7-early-signs-of-liver-cirrhosis-know-5-tips-to-prevent-liver-damage-101747305290844.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="mild yellowing"&gt;mild yellowing&lt;/a&gt; of the whites of the eyes or facial skin that should never be ignored,” he told HT Lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Facial puffiness and under-eye swelling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wake up with a consistently bloated look around your cheeks and eyes, it may not just be a lack of sleep. Dr Sudeep Khanna, senior consultant, gastroenterology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, pointed to fluid retention as the culprit. “When the liver is overloaded with fat, it produces less of the proteins needed to keep fluids inside blood vessels. This leads to leakage into facial tissues, causing&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/suffering-from-swollen-puffy-eyes-dermatologist-shares-why-this-may-happen-and-how-to-reduce-puffiness-101756377953013.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="persistent puffiness,"&gt; persistent puffiness,&lt;/a&gt;” he explained in an interview to HT Lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Adult acne and oily breakouts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudden breakouts, particularly around the jawline, cheeks, and forehead, can be a sign of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). According to Dr Sakpal, a fatty liver cannot remove toxins or balance hormones like androgens efficiently. This imbalance triggers overactive oil glands and stubborn pimples that resist standard topical treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Red 'spider' veins and rosacea-like flushing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny red lines branching out like a spider’s web — known as spider angiomas — are frequent markers of severe liver scarring or cirrhosis. Dr Raut explained these are caused by dilated capillaries. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Khanna added that 'rosacea-like flushing' often arises from poor estrogen breakdown, which increases blood flow to the facial skin and triggers visible vascular networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Dullness, itching, and patchy skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver disease can rob the skin of its natural glow. Dr Sakpal shared that a fatty liver often reduces the absorption of vitamins A and E, leading to dry, flaky, and itchy skin. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Furthermore, Dr Raut added that patients may experience a 'grey-brown' darkening or patchy appearance on the face due to hormonal imbalances and the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A silent epidemic: can it be reversed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these signs are alarming, the medical consensus is hopeful. Dr Khanna shared that fatty liver is often asymptomatic in its early stages, usually only detectable via ultrasound. However, once facial signs appear, it is a clear signal to act. “Weight loss of just 5 to 10 percent can significantly shrink liver fat and even reverse disease progression,” Dr Khanna said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recommended lifestyle swaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;⦿ Diet: Switch to greens-rich meals and cut out sugary sodas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Activity: Incorporate at least 30 minutes of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/walking-just-7k-steps-daily-can-reduce-risk-of-death-47-lower-cardiovascular-disease-incidence-25-lancet-study-10k-101753334398446.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="daily walking"&gt;daily walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Supplementation: Adding anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric can aid recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Screening: If you have risk factors like obesity or diabetes, consult a doctor for a FibroScan or ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But growing research suggests that the effects of weight loss may change with age. During midlife, losing weight may not always produce the same health benefits seen in younger adults and in some cases, it may also influence brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), researchers examined how diet-induced obesity and later weight loss affected young adult mice compared with mid-aged mice. In both groups, weight loss successfully restored healthy blood glucose control, showing that key metabolic improvements occur regardless of age. However, the scientists also observed an unexpected difference. In mid-aged mice, weight loss led to increased inflammation in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain involved in regulating appetite, energy use, and other essential functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Inflammation Raises New Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase in brain inflammation was detected at the molecular level and through detailed microscopic imaging of microglia (the brain's immune cells). The inflammatory response lasted for several weeks before gradually declining. While the long-term effects of this response are still unclear and may even play a role in achieving metabolic improvements, the findings raise important concerns. Persistent or poorly regulated inflammation in the brain has been linked to memory problems and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's. As a result, the study highlights new questions about how weight loss during midlife may interact with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers Urge a More Nuanced View of Midlife Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that losing weight in midlife is not a simple copy-and-paste of what works in young adulthood," said Alon Zemer, an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate and the first author of this paper. "Weight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity, but we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina added: "Our study characterizes the body's adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions -- molecular and structural. This high-end imaging by advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enable detection of sensitive changes with potential health ramifications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps for Protecting Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team stresses the importance of additional studies to better understand why this temporary but concerning brain inflammation occurs during midlife weight loss. Future work could help scientists develop approaches that maintain the metabolic advantages of weight loss while also protecting brain health as people age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, titled, "Weight loss aggravates obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation in mid-aged mice" was published in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt; and supported by an internal grant at BGU (with the Ilse Katz Institute of Nanoscale Science and Technology), and grants from theUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant no. 2021083) and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 194/24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren’t considered “added sugars” under FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Now our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what’s in a typical can of soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But that might be too flexible, Popp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The key is to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/food-safety"&gt;be mindful of what you’re eating&lt;/a&gt;, even if the product &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/28e626562c88439b96056e843215aa8d"&gt;seems healthy&lt;/a&gt; or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars. So can English muffins and Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although they lower the calorie content of foods, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/coke-cane-sugar-corn-syrup-better-d7a70ebd4aef1564e409dd087f6a69c3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said.

From research, it is proven to give a quick, reliable snapshot of global muscle strength and is considered a biomarker for physiological reserve, rather than just hand function,” explains Athanasios Tzoumaris, strength and conditioning coach at London-based gym and health clinic &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hooke.fit/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hooke.fit/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Hooke Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, where I took my test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="830ee13c-5b12-4d45-a273-ba0d8ad6e8b3-1"&gt;“Lower grip values are strongly associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality independent of age, existing medical conditions and body size,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physiologically, weak grip reflects loss of muscle mass and neuromuscular function. It may also indicate chronic inflammation, greater frailty, as well as poor nutrition—factors that accelerate biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinically, it is used to case-find probable sarcopenia [age-related muscle loss] and to add prognostic information to routine assessments as it is inexpensive, reproducible and predictive of functional decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with muscle strength in general, grip strength naturally declines with age, “reflecting changes in muscle mass, neural drive and overall physiological resilience,” says Tzoumaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, healthy adults reach peak grip strength in their late 20s to early 40s. From about age 50 onward, strength tends to fall by roughly 10% per decade, but maintaining resistance training and physical activity can significantly slow down this decline, keeping grip strength, and the health and longevity benefits it reflects, well above age-based norms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-FksH83USHZtfFrgNwmzjLV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-FksH83USHZtfFrgNwmzjLV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-are-the-best-ways-to-monitor-grip-strength" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-monitor-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to monitor grip strength?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ea2a2713-14df-47df-b5c7-b24ba156d4a9"&gt;Experts agree that grip strength can be reliably monitored using handheld dynamometry testing. “For the sake of consistency of assessment, in-depth insights and interpretation of the results, as well as training recommendations, you would ideally refer to exercise specialists using a professional-grade dynamometer,” says Tzoumaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told me that his high-tech contraption measures not only peak force (or maximal strength), “but also how quickly you get to that peak force, in milliseconds. The software then calculates asymmetries between limbs and other quite scientific metrics that involve a fair amount of physics, which you wouldn’t be able to replicate with an at-home device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For at-home testing, “there are fairly inexpensive dynamometers you can buy that produce acceptable testing results which may allow you to monitor progress, however they don’t offer the same insights into how an individual has achieved that score,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At-home devices are likely not as sensitive, he adds, potentially leading to less accurate and certainly less detailed results. “But if you follow the same process each time you use it, you should be able to spot changes and trends over time in your scores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-collectionwidget-c9c3c57376f015cf8c788b46314846c1" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="4cbb00d2-32f3-4b36-b56d-1a5282b4730f"&gt;There are ways to track grip strength without a dynamometer, too. This could involve seeing how long you can hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand and timing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Set a target time and see if you can achieve it. If you are not able to, stick to the same weight until you do achieve it. Once you are able to hold that weight for the target time, pick a slightly heavier weight and follow the same process,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing this way would not give a direct representation of maximal grip strength, as it measures grip strength endurance—still a strength quality but different to maximal strength. However, it can still provide some insight into someone’s grip strength progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-grip-strength-norms" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-grip-strength-norms"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grip Strength Norms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="2880c739-42e5-4bd0-81cc-23914e2361f2"&gt;So, roughly how strong should you expect your grip strength to be in each decade of your life? If you want to gauge your own grip strength, to see if you’re on track for your age, here, Tzoumaris has shared some examples of normative value ranges—below average, average and above average, by age and sex, that the gym uses to calculate the results of its handgrip test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-table-FksH83USHZtfFrgNwmzjLV-8qJhq9xBUfdakHF5lV0KFDZPBgSsghKE" class="slice-container

id="6bfc20a6-5d5d-45dd-b213-adef6973eb8a"&gt;Training grip strength can be done in and out of the gym, according to Tzoumaris. “You can improve your grip strength by consistently training the muscles of your hands, forearms, and wrists. The goal is to build both maximal strength (your peak force) and endurance (how long you can sustain it for).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the gym, some simple but effective exercises include dead hangs from a pull-up bar, farmer’s carries with dumbbells or kettlebells, plate pinches for thumb strength (where you hold a weight plate in one hand with your thumb on one side and fingers on the other for as long as possible), and wrist curls to target the forearm flexors,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outside the gym, even everyday actions like squeezing a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fhand-gripper%2Fs%3Fk%3Dhand%2Bgripper%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-8253993319126482745-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/hand-gripper/s?k=hand+gripper" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fhand-gripper%2Fs%3Fk%3Dhand%2Bgripper%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;hand gripper&lt;/a&gt;, tennis ball or carrying heavy shopping bags can help.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Many consumers feel pride in avoiding the glazed pastries in the supermarket and instead opting for “all natural” granola that comes packed with extra protein. Same goes for low-fat yogurts “made with real fruit,” “organic” plant-based milks and bottled “superfood” smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyer beware: Healthy grocery buzzwords like those often cover up an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-hot-climate-sugar-soda-diabetes-dee1cb27322afb3e556fd2c6f8ecf1ae"&gt;unhealthy amount of sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/c147e0085eb842ac9144e8214dddd063"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are difficult to quickly spot because many companies use clever marketing to distract consumers, said Nicole Avena, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical School and Princeton University who has studied added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avena said while some health-forward brands know people are starting to become aware of the hazards of added sugars, “a lot of the bigger brands don’t worry so much about people’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to spot hidden sugars and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;What to look for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with saturated fat and salt, eating excess sugar is linked to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/033b68db8ce342cd9cfdcda57a628027"&gt;heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other health risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average American consumes 17 grams of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/sugar-shrink-the-sweet-spot-for-blood-sugar-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well." data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren’t considered “added sugars” under FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;What should you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what’s in a typical can of soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that might be too flexible, Popp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/food-safety"&gt;be mindful of what you’re eating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, even if the product &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/28e626562c88439b96056e843215aa8d"&gt;seems healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars. So can English muffins and Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Taking from one column to add to another&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they lower the calorie content of foods, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coke-cane-sugar-corn-syrup-better-d7a70ebd4aef1564e409dd087f6a69c3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said. She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn’t affect blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t let the food companies decide how much sugar you’re eating,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Stumm writes about food, travel and wellness.

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The patient was rushed to the Cam Khe Regional Medical Center suffering from dizziness, persistent vomiting, and acute pain in the right upper abdomen, doctors said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to her family, she initially took three tablets, but when the pain persisted, she consumed five more, nearly exhausting an entire blister pack. It is not clear while the family failed to monitor her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with a severe overdose and provided intensive treatment involving antidotes and intravenous fluids, allowing her condition to stabilize after five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;While paracetamol is a common over-the-counter pain reliever, medical experts warn of a rising trend in poisoning cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Nguyen Duy Long from the center's Toxicology Department noted that while the drug is generally safe, overdoses or even therapeutic doses can be toxic for individuals who are malnourished, alcohol-dependent, or suffering from liver disease. Prolonged use or combining multiple medications containing paracetamol can lead to severe complications, including acute liver injury, liver failure, coagulation disorders, and multi-organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Medical recommendations state that the maximum daily dose for adults should not exceed 3.5 to 4 grams within 24 hours, with doses spaced four to six hours apart. For the standard 500 mg tablet, this equates to a maximum of six tablets per day. In children, the dosage must be strictly calculated based on body weight, typically 10–15 mg per kilogram per dose, with a daily maximum of 50–70 mg per kilogram. Parents are advised to use powder sachets or rectal suppositories when necessary, ensuring each dose is spaced at least five to six hours apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctor Long advises against self-medicating with excessive doses or using painkillers for prolonged periods without professional guidance. Medications should always be taken according to the specific instructions of pharmacists or healthcare workers, with a particular warning against combining different drugs that contain the same active ingredient, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Parents are urged to supervise medication use for children, store medicines safely to avoid confusion, and seek immediate medical attention if any abnormal symptoms occur after ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4856728,4908227,4695117,3639716,3502109" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, feel free to mix and match meals if there's one you don’t like. Because we created this meal plan with healthy blood sugar in mind, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutritional profile, particularly as it pertains to calories, carbohydrates, fiber and protein. You can feel free to repeat a meal in this list or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17899/health-condition/diabetic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if you prefer. Each breakfast ranges from 301 to 453 calories and 35 to 48 grams of carbs. Lunch options span 374 to 416 calories and 43 to 46 grams of carbohydrates. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;How many carbs should I eat per day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for how many carbs you should eat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Factors like body size and activity level can impact how your blood sugar responds to carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Paying attention to how your blood sugar reacts to the foods you eat can help clue you in to the best routine for your body. For more individualized recommendations, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_181-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overlook Your Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;: People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart disease compared to people without.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When eating for better blood sugars, consider the impact on your heart health as well. Strategies like increasing fiber and keeping an eye on saturated fat and sodium can help protect your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair Protein With Carbs&lt;/strong&gt;: To prevent blood sugar spikes and promote more stable levels, aim to pair carbohydrates with protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that this strategy results in lower blood sugar levels compared to a carbohydrate consumed without a protein source.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To do this in practice, pair a carbohydrate food, like fruit, with a protein source such as nuts, edamame, peanut butter, cottage cheese, yogurt or a hard-boiled egg.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Because total added sugar intake can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, it may be helpful to take inventory of where added sugars may be making their way in your routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we opted to skip added sugar entirely in this plan, that’s not necessary or sustainable for most people long-term. Instead, aim to follow the American Heart Association's recommendation of limiting added sugar to 9 teaspoons (36 grams) for men and 6 teaspoons (25 grams) for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to dessert items, things like sweetened drinks, flavored yogurt, cereals, granola bars, granola and many prepared foods are common sources of added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump Up the Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that can help promote better blood sugar and improve heart health - a win-win!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber-rich foods travel through the digestive system slower than refined grains and added sugar, which means it can help you feel fuller for longer and promote a steadier release of glucose, resulting in more stable blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber-rich foods include whole-grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include Physical Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: The American Diabetes Association recommends people aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While that’s a great goal to aim for, don’t fret if you’re not there yet. Research shows that walking for just two to five minutes after a meal can help reduce blood sugar levels, further proving that small daily habits can lead to big impacts on health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The company clarified that the issue pertained to a single batch identified in January 2025 and did not merit a blanket warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company strongly refuted the “over-cautionary and misplaced reference” to 2023 made in the recent Australian advisory, stressing that it “does not reflect the current situation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhayrab has been manufactured by IIL since 2000, with over 210 million doses supplied across India and 40 countries. It continues to hold a 40 per cent market share in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) advised that Australian travellers who received the anti-rabies vaccine Abhayrab in India after November 1, 2023, should consider the vaccination invalid and start a new course. In January 2025, IIL proactively identified a packaging anomaly in one specific batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company official said, “The company immediately notified Indian regulators and law enforcement agencies, lodged a formal complaint and worked closely with authorities to ensure swift action. Importantly, this was an isolated incident and the counterfeit batch is no longer available on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inbtw_content_maindiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIL emphasised that every batch of vaccine manufactured in India was tested and released by the Central Drugs Laboratory before being made available for sale or administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunil Tiwari, vice-president &amp;amp; head of quality management, IIL, said the company aimed to reassure stakeholders that its pharmacovigilance and quality systems were robust and the public could continue to trust vaccines supplied directly by IIL and its authorised channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tribune India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:30:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUDhEZVdxeFJVMk01c0lFZnNuM0YxUF9KUVhQX0hlOTJrR2I0OVdPMnI3NUdmcXhqLUZ5UldWUW5FVllvd3dOd3F5LW43MFZVRFE0TkFNSG9SYUNZdlJ6VjQxZlpGYkxWUFhXSHdVQ0k5T0FDVF8zdVdYdGE3UklBZDFGcjY0bjJnRFd6bEJpZDhZZE4zTHJDZWZOWThUdHluQVUybE10VjNBNlXSAa8BQVVfeXFMTnFIaDRYRFExU21HUHNKeS1Bb2IxUmVQaHpqM3hDTUtkQ1gxclBBUmlzVlVaOE9Gek5uTTZybnJNaDdtUDR1dWJiQUk4a0xWTjAzd1NLNXY2YUIwRWg1dnRSZTBBVjhvUnRHUjFLYVk2aHJVRXNubDF5X3MzSkhadjM0VC1QcWQzT2tITk9sRzloMktkZlVrZUppUDNVeFIta3Q2UFM3OEdxTG9idlVTRQ</guid></item><item><title>一位胃肠病学家说，这种受欢迎的食物正在严重破坏您的肠道- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/gastroenterologist-says-popular-food-wreaking-183000546.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Avoid This Popular Food for Better Gut Health&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;d3sign - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69771726/symptoms-of-unhealthy-gut/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy gut;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; and digestive tract has much wider implications for your health than just avoiding GI woes.

Dr. Dibba explains that processed foods, especially those that are acidic, may damage the gut lining—the barrier that absorbs water and nutrients while preventing toxins and partially digested food from making it to the bloodstream.

Researchers showed that a severe drop in NAD+—a core energy molecule—drives Alzheimer’s pathology in both human brains and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring proper NAD+ balance with the drug P7C3-A20 not only prevented disease in at-risk mice but also reversed advanced pathology, repairing brain damage and fully restoring cognitive function. The findings point to a major shift in how Alzheimer’s may be treated, suggesting that recovery—not just slowing decline—could one day be achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central NAD+ Failure:&lt;/strong&gt; Human and mouse Alzheimer’s brains showed a dramatic loss of NAD+, impairing essential cellular functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal Achieved:&lt;/strong&gt; Restoring NAD+ balance repaired pathology and fully recovered cognition even in mice with advanced disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; The targeted drug P7C3-A20 restored healthy NAD+ levels without the dangers linked to over-the-counter NAD+ boosters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University Hospital Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For over a century, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114448"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finding that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on their previous work, published in &lt;em&gt;Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA,&lt;/em&gt; showing that restoring the brain’s NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, not only did preserving NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to dangerously high levels that promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to supraphysiologic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer’s reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766864151217"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about NAD+ in Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They found that a severe decline in NAD+ is a major driver of Alzheimer’s pathology, disrupting energy balance and damaging key brain systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766864152647"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can restoring NAD+ actually reverse advanced Alzheimer’s effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Here, however, we provide proof of principle for therapeutic reversibility of advanced AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advanced disease amyloid-driven 5xFAD mice, treatment with P7C3-A20, which restores nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis, reverses tau phosphorylation, blood-brain barrier deterioration, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and neuroinflammation and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, resulting in full cognitive recovery and reduction of plasma levels of the clinical AD biomarker p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P7C3-A20 also reverses advanced disease in tau-driven PS19 mice and protects human brain microvascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In humans and mice, pathology severity correlates with disruption of brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and the brains of nondemented people with Alzheimer’s neuropathology exhibit gene expression patterns suggestive of preserved NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-six proteins aberrantly expressed in advanced 5xFAD mouse brain and normalized by P7C3-A20 show similar alterations in human AD brain, revealing targets with potential for optimizing translation to patient care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:41:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBXeHI4RXRfalQ5MVEyZmlucDdQV1dZWGlBTTAwd3JBZGVvU1ZrY3NxUEJORVR2LXlVS0dYRDdKeUJzbWE0czJ6Q2xXVXV1OEdjS3pVN05hMEswMk1HTHBNUUFDOThYaU1neUJ4dE96dnY2V0xUMFNKckpDVU8xUQ</guid></item><item><title>女人的妈妈不可信，最终假装心脏病发作，所以她的女儿拒绝拨打911 ，让她忍受后果- TwistedSifter</title><link>https://twistedsifter.com/2025/12/womans-mom-fakes-a-heart-attack-so-her-daughter-refuses-to-call-911-and-leaves/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pek061/aita_for_not_calling_an_ambulance_for_my_mother/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In this story&lt;/a&gt;, one woman is in this exact situation with her mother, and she refused to call 911. Now, she wondering if that was the wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for not calling an ambulance for my mother?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My (20f) mother (55f) is a narcissist. It’s become worse as I’ve gotten older, but basically, she has to make everything about herself always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s always twisting someone else’s problems to make it about her or lying about the dumbest stuff to gain attention or screaming and fake crying when someone says she’s in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s a complete attention seeker, and I’m convinced she has a personally disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her mother is convinced she has other medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, she’s taken to faking medical issues or illness to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s done this before like faking a gluten allergy despite still eating gluten with no problems, or pretending to have the most obviously fake panic attack when being called out for her nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems, that isn’t enough, and for the past few weeks, she’s been talking about being diagnosed with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an argument at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we had dinner and my brother (25m) told us that he wanted to marry his girlfriend (just said it casually, not like he actually proposed yet or anything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom doesn’t like brother’s girlfriend ever since they started dating (even though she’s only meet her a handful of times), and decided to get into a screaming-match about it with my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t having any of it, and just got up and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with him because, jokes on me if I’m going to stay with her when she’s like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mother’s next move was pretty extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, she then ‘fainted’, making pain-noises, while writhing on the ground. I think she was trying to imitate a seizure while conscious? IDK but she looked like a fish flopping around crazily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I just stared at her, as it honestly looked like an adult throwing a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told us she was having a heart attack and to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When neither of us did, she screamed that we were selfish children letting her die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was definitely faking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t end up leaving then, but we did stay to see what she’d do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After neither of us really reacted for a few minutes, she got up, totally fine, but was mad at us for not helping her and started screaming again about how we’re abusing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then brother and I left for real, and went to his girlfriend’s house. That’s where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, she’s wondering if she should’ve called 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently she posted on Facebook about how she survived her heart attack, while berating my brother and me for not caring about her and being emotionally abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt (not actually my aunt but mom’s best friend), messaged me and my brother about it and I told her what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said I should have just called 911 anyway because it wasn’t my place to say and they could have determined if she was really fine or not, but I’m so sick of her lying nonsense and I’m not wasting 911’s time on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So AITA because I didn’t call them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling 911 would’ve been a waste of time for 911. She did the right thing. Her mom needs therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person would’ve called 911.&lt;/p&gt;

But epigenetic factors such as our behaviors, environments and diets can turn some genes on or shut others off through different processes. One such mechanism is DNA methylation, the focus of the new study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What we were looking for here are the chemical ‘tags’ that can be added onto your DNA,” said Jordana Bell, a professor in epigenomics at King’s College London and the lead author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Consider it the “grammar” of your genome, said José M. Ordovás, a senior scientist and leader of the Precision Nutrition &amp;amp; Healthy Aging directive at Tufts University who was not involved in the study. These markers don’t alter the fixed sequence of your DNA, but the tags (like punctuation marks) affect how they are expressed,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;DNA methylation patterns also shift with age, allowing for the development of epigenetic clocks that estimate biological (rather than chronological) age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Using these clocks to compare epigenetic markers of aging among the study participants, the researchers found a link between higher levels of theobromine in the blood and reduced signs of cellular aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;After running further tests to see whether other cocoa components - including caffeine - showed similar patterns, Bell and her team discovered it occurred only with theobromine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What our results are suggesting is that [theobromine] might be affecting the activity of genes,” Bell said. “And then that contributes to aging and health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s also possible that something synergistic is going on with the theobromine and other chocolate components they &lt;i&gt;didn’t &lt;/i&gt;measure in the study, such as polyphenols, Bell said. These anti-inflammatory compounds, which are also found in dark chocolate, are linked to better brain function, a more varied gut microbiome, and lower risks of conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_are_the_study_limitations" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

One of the sample groups did complete a food questionnaire that asked how frequently the participants ate chocolate, but it didn’t delve into specifics such as what kind they were eating, the percentage of cocoa it had, or how much of it they ate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The data also comes from one single point in time, so the study wasn’t able to see how theobromine levels over weeks, months or years might relate to aging rates, Bell said. “You need to see things moving one time after another,” Ordovás said. “That brings more confidence.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And epigenetic clocks aren’t set in stone. “These are dynamic estimates,” Bell said. “It just means that at this point in time, looking at your DNA, we estimate that you seem to be aging a little bit slower or faster than we would expect based on your chronological age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This is a good thing because you can use this knowledge to guide diet or other health interventions to change your biological age estimate, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_does_this_mean_for_choosing_chocolate" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile 
             padding_top_24"&gt;What does this mean for choosing chocolate?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The findings about theobromine add to what we know about the other health-promoting compounds in dark chocolate, such as polyphenols. And here are some recommendations about dark chocolate from Alexis Supan, an outpatient dietitian at the Bariatric &amp;amp; Metabolic Institute with the Cleveland Clinic:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While anything above 50 percent cocoa solids can be considered “dark” chocolate, that range is a big one, and you’d probably be better served aiming for 70 percent or greater.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The higher the percentage, the more bitter it will be, but it will also bring a higher concentration of the beneficial compounds and less of the “not-so-healthy things like the saturated fat and the sugar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure that cocoa is the first ingredient listed on the label. Ideally, you’d want just three ingredients: cocoa, sugar and cocoa butter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Choose chocolate that isn’t Dutch-processed, which is sometimes listed on the label. This alkalization process mellows its flavor, but also strips away some of the polyphenols. “You’re not getting quite as much antioxidant power,” Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For balance in your diet, keep the rest of your daily added sugar in check. A one-ounce serving of dark chocolate can provide about one-third of the daily upper limit for women and one-quarter for men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark chocolate can contain higher levels of harmful metals such as cadmium and lead, which are riskier for pregnant people or younger children, Supan said. Consumer Reports has a list of levels in many popular brands, so you can make an informed decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As long as the chocolate fits this criteria, what form you choose to consume it in, whether in a mug or bar, shouldn’t matter. But when used in baking - say, that dark chocolate cake or rich, gooey cookies - keep in mind that the cocoa is competing with ingredients such as butter, sugar and flour, so you’re probably taking in less of the good products, Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Her tip for the holidays? Try a dark chocolate bark. You can make it festive with some fruit and nuts, but you’ll still be getting a solid dose of the actual dark chocolate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finally, if you aren’t a fan of chocolate, don’t force yourself to eat it simply for some type of cellular benefits that theobromine might bring. After all, “methylation is involved in aging, but it is a tiny percentage compared with all the many other factors,” Ordovás said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These include your diet as a whole, physical activity, sleep and stress levels. “This is one tiny little sliver, and it’s a great reason to not feel bad about having an ounce of dark chocolate today,” Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQdXNQR19uMmJzOXc4QWh5MzNucXk2UkxyS0IyNUxDWElsRmhDYmQxZGhnWEM5VDRSUTl2RGJHN28wSXYwZnJfa1lPSFNiWnNVR3VmT3Rib1EtNG1OUjJkTmZ6UTF3VkFCaFh1ZUpUZWw0ZWJLZEphQlVvNzNxWkdyWlVOMkNZcGxIdEE</guid></item><item><title>一位胃肠病学家说，这种受欢迎的食物正在严重破坏您的肠道-预防</title><link>https://www.prevention.com/health/a69849055/food-impacting-gut/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="1.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69771726/symptoms-of-unhealthy-gut/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69771726/symptoms-of-unhealthy-gut/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="healthy gut" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; and digestive tract has much wider implications for your health than just avoiding GI woes.

The findings suggest that these adverse events disrupt an individual’s ability to regulate emotions and practice self-compassion, which in turn exacerbates attention and hyperactivity issues. This research highlights the potential for psychological interventions focusing on self-kindness to help mitigate ADHD symptoms stemming from early life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Individuals with the inattentive presentation often struggle to sustain focus, stay organized, and remember daily tasks. Those with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation may experience inner restlessness, excessive physical movement, and difficulty waiting their turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ADHD is often viewed as a biological or genetic condition, environmental factors also play a significant role in its development and severity. Previous scientific literature has established that adverse childhood experiences, often referred to as ACEs, are linked to a variety of negative mental health outcomes. ACEs include events such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as household dysfunctions like domestic violence, parental divorce, or family incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the known link between early trauma and general psychological distress, fewer studies have specifically examined how these events influence ADHD symptoms in college students. There is also a lack of research regarding the internal protective factors that might buffer these effects. The authors of the current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the psychological mechanisms connecting early adversity to adult ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically sought to understand the role of emotion regulation and self-compassion. Emotion regulation refers to the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have and how they experience and express them. Self-compassion involves treating oneself with warmth and understanding during difficult times rather than reacting with harsh self-judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Türkiye, a cultural context where traditional child-rearing practices and family structures may influence how adverse experiences are processed. The research team recruited a sample of 442 young adults from a public university. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 29 years, with an average age of approximately 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample was predominantly female, making up 67.4% of the group, while males accounted for 32.6%. The researchers collected data using a web-based survey tool. Participants were informed of their rights and provided consent before completing a battery of validated psychological measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess early life difficulties, the researchers used the Adverse Childhood Experiences Checklist. This 10-item measure asks participants to indicate whether they experienced specific types of abuse or household dysfunction before the age of 18. Responses were recorded using a simple yes or no format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current ADHD symptoms were measured using the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1). This 18-item questionnaire screens for symptoms experienced over the past six months. It includes two subscales: one for inattention and one for hyperactivity-impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed emotion regulation using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short Form. This scale measures how frequently individuals use strategies like cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression to manage their emotions. For this study, the authors focused on the general ability to manage emotional experiences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion was measured using the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. This 12-item instrument assesses how kind and caring individuals are toward themselves during instances of pain or failure. It includes elements such as self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that adverse childhood experiences were common among the participants. Approximately 76% of the students reported experiencing at least one adverse event. About 27% of the sample reported four or more adverse experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis revealed clear associations between the variables. Students who reported a higher number of adverse childhood experiences tended to have lower levels of self-compassion. These students also exhibited lower levels of emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, higher scores on the ACEs checklist were associated with higher levels of both attention deficit and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. The researchers used a technique called path analysis to test how these variables influenced one another. This analysis suggested that the relationship between early adversity and ADHD symptoms was not entirely direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data supported a model where adverse childhood experiences lead to lower self-compassion. This lack of self-compassion then predicts difficulties in emotion regulation. Finally, poor emotion regulation predicts increased severity of ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion appeared to play a mediating role. The analysis showed that self-compassion had an indirect effect on the relationship between ACEs and emotion regulation. It also had an indirect effect on the association between ACEs and ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that emotion regulation mediated the link between self-compassion and ADHD symptoms. This implies that one reason self-compassion helps reduce ADHD symptoms is that it improves an individual’s ability to manage their emotions. All variables together accounted for 22% of the variance in attention deficit symptoms and 16% of the variance in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that individuals with high levels of self-compassion are better equipped to process adverse experiences constructively. They are less likely to engage in self-criticism or shame. This positive self-regard appears to foster better emotional control, which subsequently reduces the intensity of ADHD-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted that adaptive emotion regulation strategies serve as protective factors. When individuals can reappraise stressful situations rather than suppressing their feelings, they may experience less impulsivity and better focus. The disruption of these skills by early trauma appears to be a key pathway to ADHD symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to this study that should be considered. The research relied on self-reported data, which can be subject to memory errors or social desirability bias. Participants may not have remembered childhood events accurately or may have been hesitant to report them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study utilized a cross-sectional design, meaning data was collected at a single point in time. This prevents the researchers from establishing definitive cause-and-effect relationships. It is possible that the relationships between these variables work in different directions than hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample consisted solely of university students in Türkiye. This specific demographic means the results may not generalize to other populations, such as older adults, those not in college, or people from different cultural backgrounds. Additionally, the participants were screened for symptoms but were not clinically diagnosed with ADHD by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlighted the potential overlap between ADHD and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD often display hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts that can mimic the inattention seen in ADHD. It is important for clinicians to distinguish between trauma-related inattention and neurodevelopmental attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should employ longitudinal designs to track these variables over time. This would help clarify how early adversity impacts the development of these symptoms throughout young adulthood. Including clinical samples with formal ADHD diagnoses would also strengthen the validity of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers significant implications for mental health support. The results suggest that interventions aimed at increasing self-compassion could be beneficial for college students with ADHD symptoms, particularly those with a history of trauma. Teaching students to be kind to themselves may improve their emotional regulation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251370427" target="_blank"&gt;Adverse Childhood Experiences and ADHD in College Students: Exploring the Role of Emotion Regulation and Self-Compassion&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Fikriye Eda Karaçul and Gökmen Arslan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVXl0eHpUSDdOZ0M1MWlxNG9QLW1mT0FvQlVYajQtTGd1RDZkRnJwZHVJeEdDSU92Z1Ayci0wVTV5cVE4Q3VWWmpVUURteDFQSnJPdXAyRk1vNDVIWFdTTkpCTTZuODdwR3VJY19wTDQyOGEyblBYU0l4WWQyeVRUZExrenlwZHA4U0JMUkczQjNtdE0ybzgxQ19FNUxFYnJ0S3ZMd3llVklIY01a</guid></item><item><title>狗在多大程度上减轻了我们的压力？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/how-much-do-dogs-reduce-our-stress-1/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-hEgojh wpds-c-hEgojh-ikjuZWZ-css PodcastCarousel_storyCard__hJIce"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Broken Doors " src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcast.posttv.com%2Fseries%2F20220324%2Ft_1648139452139_name_RelatedImage_900x300.jpg&amp;amp;w=400"&gt;&lt;p class="PodcastCarousel_storyDesc__ZCeG0"&gt;An investigation into no-knock warrants in the American justice system — and what happens when accountability is flawed at every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:02:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxONnRWQjlnN0trWGFaMGJnT1NieGpVdGN6SjEyTm1rWVBWenFKZFNyN3U0UkViNE9hTUg0bk1PX1lRNTBaZEROOEdHMXNRU3hGYUZtbEp0RkMzV2VpYTZ0UmZBVXRfRGJvSmphck1RWFJQcDdSMFB2dmw3YjIwN21aYXV3MHdlZVVRcEdXSGxDV0F6TEcw</guid></item><item><title>我每天早上喝柠檬水，并注意到身体的这3个好处-健康：值得信赖和富有同情心的健康信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/daily-lemon-water-benefits-11831207</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking lemon water is the first thing I do every single morning. I have done it for as long as I can remember. Why? It keeps me hydrated, supports digestion, and boosts my immune system—and it might even make my skin glow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-it-hydrates-me"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love water, but lemon makes it more fun. Starting every morning with lemon water helps hydrate me after sleep and sets me up for my morning workout. It also knocks several cups of water off my daily hydration goal of at least ten.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-it-supports-digestion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I always appreciate simple digestive aids that don't require supplements. Lemons are one answer. For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;One very small study found that the acid in lemons increases gastric emptying (how quickly the stomach digests food).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another study found that taking vitamin C supplements improves "good" gut bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, which also helps fight infection.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-it-supports-heart-health-and-healing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Citrus fruits like lemons are high in vitamin C and other antioxidants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenolic compounds are antioxidants that support healthy blood pressure, blood flow, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/lower-cholesterol-naturally-8350243" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; ("healthy cholesterol") levels. All of this reduces your risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C helps with tissue repair and growth. It's an important part of collagen, a key protein in skin, joints, and bones that loses strength with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-my-process"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what exactly do I do? (Hint: It's very simple.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up water:&lt;/strong&gt; I fill a 24-ounce mason jar with water and microwave it for about 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add lemon:&lt;/strong&gt; I add half a lemon per 24 ounces of water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink slowly:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first thing I consume every day, before tea/coffee or breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I continue this trend when traveling as much as possible—because how hard is it to bring or buy a lemon? It's especially helpful after later-than-usual bedtimes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning lemon water is simply what I do now: it is a fully-formed habit. It reminds me that health doesn't need to be overcomplicated, time-consuming, or expensive. It also reminds me that the smallest habit can make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-my-1-tip"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lemon water has a few caveats due to its acidic nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooth erosion:&lt;/strong&gt; Highly acidic foods can contribute to dental erosion—loss of tooth enamel, the outer protective layer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acid reflux: &lt;/strong&gt;Consuming citrus regularly (e.g., daily) can contribute to acid reflux—when acid from your stomach bubbles up into your esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;My top tip: Wait about an hour before brushing your teeth.&lt;/strong&gt; This allows your saliva to wash away the acid and protects tooth enamel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Dental Association (ADA) also recommends rinsing your mouth with water or eating dairy after highly acidic meals or beverages and using a straw for acidic beverages, which I will start doing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Side note: I often do oil-pulling, otherwise known as swishing coconut oil in my mouth for several minutes and spitting it out. Many people believe it has benefits, but the ADA points out the lack of research.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, my dental hygienist recently commented on the whiteness of my teeth and told me I have basically no plaque. So, I'm still a believer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The new weekly toll marks a 38% week-over-week surge in laboratory-confirmed flu infections. It's a milestone in an already rough flu season that &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/flu-season-arrives-in-ny-with-major-spike-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrived early&lt;/a&gt; and drove down &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-school-attendance-drops-parents-freak-out-as-flu-season-foils-christmas-plans" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attendance at the city’s public schools&lt;/a&gt; during the week leading into the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1gcvh"&gt;Hospitalizations tied to influenza jumped sharply, with 3,666 New Yorkers requiring inpatient care compared to 2,251 the week before, continuing a trend of rising severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fhqm6"&gt;“We can look at how hospitals are doing around New York every two hours, so we can monitor whether hospitals are being overwhelmed or not,” McDonald said. “Right now things are going smoothly, but this is something we're paying close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="khon"&gt;Health officials declared influenza “prevalent” across New York state earlier this month, requiring health care facilities to have unvaccinated personnel wear masks around patients and residents. The designation reflects widespread transmission across all regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9lh0v"&gt;McDonald said it was too early to say when the season would reach its peak, but warned “it is gonna get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="djg7s"&gt;State health officials say it's not too late to get a flu vaccine. This year’s vaccination rate is roughly in line with past years. But this year's flu strain is more severe, McDonald said, so “if you haven't had your flu vaccine this year, this is the year to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ee2bu"&gt;Those who are sick — especially children, people who are older or people who have underlying health conditions — should reach out to their doctors for antiviral drugs that can reduce symptoms and complications. However, the drugs must be started within 48 hours of coming down with the flu to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7cft6"&gt;People who are feeling ill “should really not go to work or not visit family,” McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f2epd"&gt;He also suggested those who are immunocompromised or have a serious underlying disease wear an N95 or KN95 mask in crowded indoor spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bpmrs"&gt;COVID-19 and RSV — another respiratory illness — also continue to circulate, but state data shows COVID-19 hospitalizations have been relatively stable in recent weeks and RSV activity has seen smaller increases compared with influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPa1I2U1VoLVROOEJOVDBlN2ExbGlYTFlwb1pfMHpXRFg3MHhoVUJ3ZFBhMGJpZ3BON1RENWZIWDdWZ0gtT1A2QkhmTGVUaXNueHZ6VTZlclRGRkFrUklmcWxCQXRTWlZLZVRNb3FOUDZEQmtScFNyUWdZWm5hV08zblNyZmh2eTV5czdTNkhuX3V3V01CLXFyaQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
