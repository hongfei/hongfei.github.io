						&lt;strong class="dateline"&gt;MITCHELLVILLE, Iowa —&lt;/strong&gt; 													&lt;p&gt;Five people were hurt in a two-car crash that left one vehicle upside down and submerged in water on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Polk County Sheriff's Office says the two vehicles crashed at the intersection of N.E. 112th Street and East University Avenue south of Mitchellville at about 9:15 a.m. Sunday. A deputy and several witnesses were able to flip the upturned vehicle back onto its wheels.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An adult male in the submerged vehicle was taken to a nearby hospital by air ambulance. His condition is listed as stable.

But lurking beneath all these headlines and gripes lies a stubborn, unshakable fact: in 2025, Americans simply don’t live as long as citizens in dozens of other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re an average American baby born this year, you’re expected to live about 78 years. That sounds fine, maybe even good to some ears, but step outside US borders even just over to Canada or across the United Kingdom and it’s abundantly clear: Americans are living shorter lives than almost all their economic peers and, frankly, than millions of people in less wealthy parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on? Let’s take a look into what the latest data tells us about American longevity—and why, for all the tech innovations and world-class medical centers dotting the landscape, life expectancy here just keeps stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;keyword id="3932708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="US-life-expectancy" source="Orion"&gt;US life expectancy&lt;/keyword&gt; measure up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: life expectancy is the average number of years a newborn can expect to live under current mortality rates. In the US, that number hit a recent low after COVID-19 but has since bounced back a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s not keeping pace with history—or with the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023 US life expectancy: 78.4 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Average (2025): 73.5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking: 48th globally (and slipping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: the US is above the global average, but a few years below its “peer” nations. Most of Western Europe, plus Japan, Australia, South Korea, and even some smaller nations like Monaco, enjoy life expectancies between 82 and 87 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are on average living about 3–5 years less than their economic peers, and as much as 8 years less than the world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the latest stats for the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both sexes: 78.4 years (2023 data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Males: 75.8 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Females: 81.1 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Canada, France, Japan, and even the UK all clock in well above the US average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO (World Health Organization) data lines up: no matter which authority you check, the trend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s rank in the longevity league&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that put the US? In 48th place (as per several reports) and, according to the latest forecasts by World Population Review, likely to drop even further down the list by 2050. Other wealthy nations, meanwhile, continue to inch higher, sometimes gaining years while the US just creeps forward months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer nations growing faster: For example, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the UK, and Italy already clock in at 80+ years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;US trend is stagnating: Some projections put the US at 80.4 years—in 2050. That’s nearly a quarter-century just to gain a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is the US lagging behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time in a US health economics classroom, you might echo this refrain: Americans spend more—way more—on healthcare than anyone else, but live shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get sticky (and let’s be real, infuriating). According to the CDC and public health research, several chronic and acute challenges conspire to keep US life expectancy low:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease and obesity: Rates here dwarf those in peer nations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes: A chronic and costly epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Diseases of despair": Suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses hit the US particularly hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant mortality: Above-average for a wealthy nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle fatalities: Still shockingly high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare disparity: Insurance rates, cost barriers, and uneven healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socioeconomic inequality: Health outcomes dramatically vary by income, ZIP code, and racial group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are living shorter, sicker lives even as the country outspends rivals on everything from advanced surgeries to high-end drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to the UK and peers: A stark gap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause and zero in on a particularly telling comparison: the United States vs. the United Kingdom. Recent investigative reports by Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health deliver this sobering headline: Americans live years less than the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of excess US deaths: Heart disease, drug overdoses, infant and maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really stands out isn’t just the small year-by-year difference. It’s the long-term trend: since the 1980s, America’s trajectory has flatlined, while Europe trudges upward—even through its own crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy differences: Universal coverage, safety nets, and regenerative social programs in the UK and Europe often make healthier choices easier and provide fallback care when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health investment: The UK spends less on care, but more on prevention and community wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digging into health habits and policy differences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “silver bullet” explanations, the data won’t cut you any slack. It’s death by a thousand small problems, and they’re entangled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet: Appallingly high processed food consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultra-processed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Sedentary lifestyles prevail, especially among kids and teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addiction: A toxic brew of widespread opioid, meth, and alcohol abuse. Overdose rates have reached devastating levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health: Underfunded and stigmatized, pushing more people into crisis and self-harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Coverage: Insurance gaps, high out-of-pocket costs, and rural hospital closures remain endemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors: Pockets of heavy pollution and “food deserts.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CDC points out, even American children today face a 1-in-5 shot at developing obesity before adulthood, foreshadowing future medical costs and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would it take for America to catch up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and studies converge on a short list of must-dos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle chronic disease: Expand access to preventive screening, healthy foods, and physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address the opioid crisis: Investment in mental health and addiction treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make healthcare universal and affordable: Reduce insurance and cost barriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant health: More prenatal care, family leave, and education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle poverty and inequality: Social safety nets, fair wages, and safer housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without bolder national action—and strong local follow-through—these gains will remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s health gap is no longer a technical problem; it’s a political, social, and moral one. Other countries have shown it’s fixable, but it takes serious willpower and the humility to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for the next generation, then, is simple: Will we keep coasting along on what’s left of the old American advantage, or finally tackle the causes behind our shorter lives? For now, the world’s watching and, to tell the truth, living longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CDC – Life Expectancy Data Briefs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WHO Data: United States&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 15:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>佛罗里达州有4人死于食肉细菌：谁有风险？ - AL.com | 4 people have died from flesh-eating bacteria in Florida: Who is at risk? - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JFEVPMONJFFIRKI6KL76LSLEX4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="64ELBVFBHZFARPXCNTZ55M6RTQ"&gt;Four people have died from a flesh-eating bacteria in Florida waters, &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to the state’s health department. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CHUMCZ7XWVDZNJRLC3DIO6DAOY"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that normally lives in warm, brackish seawater and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;is found in higher numbers from May to October because of higher water temperatures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SDHXJ6FRCFDCTMRSMA7APUC2F4"&gt;Infections from the bacteria were reported in 11 Florida counties this year, while the deaths occurred in Bay, Broward, Hillsborough and St. John’s counties.

Yet depression already affects about eight percent of U.S. adults each year, and new data suggest that dieting could make that burden heavier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large U.S. survey now links calorie‑restricted diets with higher scores on the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PHQ‑9&lt;/a&gt; depression questionnaire, especially in men and in anyone carrying extra weight. The work was led by psychiatrist Dr. Gabriella Menniti at the &lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-link-between-calories-and-mood"&gt;Link between calories and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis pooled answers from 28,525 adults who described what and why they ate during six rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two thousand of them, about eight percent, flagged enough depressive symptoms to meet a clinical cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reported limiting overall calories registered depression scores almost one‑third of a point higher than similar adults who were not dieting. That margin sounds small but was consistent across income, age, and ethnic subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men who counted calories fared worse than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gym-phobia-the-hidden-workout-hurdles-faced-by-women/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, posting higher somatic complaints such as fatigue and sleep trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overweight participants who slashed calories from carbs or fat also showed larger mood dips than their weight‑stable peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-carry-a-different-risk"&gt;Men carry a different risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition scientists suspect that male biology raises the bar for minimum nutrient needs. Adult men generally require more protein, iron, and several B‑vitamins simply to maintain lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those inputs fall short, energy metabolism slows, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788288/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood‑regulating chemicals&lt;/a&gt; like serotonin may sag, increasing the odds of irritability and flat affect. The research team saw this pattern even after adjusting for income, education, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diets low in carbohydrates or fats may theoretically worsen brain function and exacerbate cognitive‑affective symptoms, especially in men with greater nutritional needs,” noted Dr. Menniti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weight-matters-more-than-willpower"&gt;Weight matters more than willpower&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying extra body mass can mask nutrient shortfalls because fat tissue stores &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;, not vitamins. Overweight dieters often cut portions without adjusting food quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch may create a loop where weight barely shifts but micronutrient levels tumble, undercutting motivation and generating disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing calories may thus result in mood slumps that can sabotage adherence before metabolic gains appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, the link between calorie cutting and low mood was strongest among adults with body mass index values between 25 and 30. The authors suggest that expectations, failed or delayed, may magnify emotional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-swings-and-calorie-cuts"&gt;Mood swings and calorie cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain burns about twenty percent of daily energy yet relies almost exclusively on glucose for that supply. Severe decreases in blood sugar impair attention within minutes and can magnify anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting carbohydrates to meet weight‑loss goals can therefore leave neurons underfed long before the scale budges. That shortfall is often misread as laziness or lack of discipline rather than a biochemical SOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fats matter as well. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9962071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Omega‑3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; help build cell membranes and regulate inflammation, and low seafood intake has been linked to mood disorders in multiple trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplement studies are mixed, yet people who start with the lowest omega‑3 levels seem to benefit the most. This pattern suggests that deficiency, not dosage, drives the mood signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-micronutrients-hide-in-plain-sight"&gt;Micronutrients hide in plain sight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 supports the methylation reactions that produce dopamine and serotonin. Observational work finds that adults with low B12 levels score higher on depression scales even after accounting for income and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron paints a similar picture, with recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10175994/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHANES&lt;/a&gt; analyses showing more depressive symptoms in men who test low for ferritin. The deficit can sap energy and flatten motivation within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restrictive calorie plans that cut red meat, eggs, or fortified cereals can nudge both nutrients below recommended thresholds within weeks. Mood changes often surface before lab tests flag anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-calories-and-mood"&gt;Balancing calories and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieticians usually recommend filling half the plate with colorful produce, a quarter with lean protein, and the rest with whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That template &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-enough-fiber-prevents-cancer-in-a-surprising-way/"&gt;supplies fiber&lt;/a&gt; for gut bacteria, amino acids for neurotransmitters, and slow‑burn starch for stable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding two servings of fatty fish per week or a daily handful of walnuts covers omega‑3s without extra pills. Vitamin‑B12‑rich foods like yogurt or fortified plant milks close common gaps for anyone skipping meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weight management, experts advise shaving no more than five hundred &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddlers-get-half-their-calories-from-ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; off daily needs. Slower loss keeps micronutrient density intact and reduces cravings that torpedo adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cut-calories-gradually"&gt;Cut calories gradually&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking mood alongside meals can be as simple as jotting one word like “flat” or “energized” next to dinner entries in a phone app. Over a week patterns emerge that tell more than any food label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If low energy always follows days under 1,800 calories, that data acts like a check‑engine light. The fix may be a small dose of complex carbs rather than abandoning the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/want-to-slow-down-aging-add-these-foods-to-your-diet/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health professionals often remind clients that food is information, not just fuel. Sending the right signal takes mindful tweaks, not monastic austerity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, sustainable changes compound faster than any crash diet. Your brain, as well as your belt, will notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2025/05/28/bmjnph-2025-001167.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Nutrition, Prevention &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:48:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPY2piOGp2UldJcXdIOGNtMFNicTVoVGlwLW5SOTJFRWtOT0VEWTBIQTBaWEhOUWZ0RUFrTkc3YVpTZHl2Wml0NDlOSTRmZ2szQzFCNGl4OXhCRy1IdGNORGJSRDNIVlJTX3RzQnNuX08zMFBFS2tDQXhnNTZCOWxwbEhMaC1kX2l5Y18wam5fMkNXX1gtTXJpMG55XzZCdTVla3BqcUt0VWZJNmdCZXplanVWMA</guid></item><item><title>过敏似乎几乎不可能避免—除非您是阿米什人-《华盛顿邮报》 | Allergies seem nearly impossible to avoid — unless you’re Amish - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTVlacUprWlVoZ05VMWVSV09lcEhoSU1wNmVKNjAxX1lSYVYzNlNWT2c5YWpNU0h3dXNZeHBGbUplSFlkNDdVTGZoUW9JdEo3T0RfSXM2RUplVlVLN25XUzVyNkNZUkV4WFlibFFtdU5RTGFqSDI1MjNtaVZxdmVlTE9ZVlFScUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W4IBUWYA45ET7FC7QT22TL3RNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether triggered by pollen, pet dander or peanuts, allergies in this day and age seem nearly impossible to avoid.

In the Amish kids, it’s probably 1 to 2 percent,” said &lt;a href="https://genes.uchicago.edu/faculty/carole-ober-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Carole Ober&lt;/a&gt;, chair of human genetics at the University of Chicago. “A few of them do have allergies, but at much, much lower rates compared to the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UF23FG35JFHN3NSP6A4OY37SUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now, Ober and other researchers are trying to discover what makes Amish and other traditional farming communities unique, in the hopes of developing a protective treatment that could be given to young children. For instance, a probiotic or essential oil that contains substances found in farm dust, such as microbes and the molecules they produce, could stimulate children’s immune systems in a way that prevents allergic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SFF6MNEFVFK7E5B6PZIQMIF7I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Certain kinds of farming practices, particularly the very traditional ones, have this extraordinary protective effect in the sense that, in these communities, asthma and allergies are virtually unknown,” said &lt;a href="https://cmm.arizona.edu/profile/donata-vercelli-md" target="_blank"&gt;Donata Vercelli&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of Arizona. “The studies that have been done in these farming populations are critical because they tell us that protection is an attainable goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRQOOVOMW5ARBB6RQOKNJT7OGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Amish are members of a Christian group who practice traditional farming — many live on single-family dairy farms — and use horses for fieldwork and transportation. As of 2024, around &lt;a href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;395,000 Amish&lt;/a&gt; live in the United States, concentrated mostly in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2AJY73RCKVGXTNBVWD6TMEVACA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the past century, the incidence of allergic diseases — including hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, food allergies and eczema — has increased dramatically. Hay fever, or an allergic reaction to tree, grass and weed pollens, emerged as the first recognized allergic disease in the early 1800s, climbing to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3293845/" target="_blank"&gt;epidemic levels&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and North America by 1900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWBGKCI4YRHEVL5BJPRQLMWCCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The 1960s saw a sharp increase in the prevalence of pediatric &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4617537/#S3" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which the airways tighten when breathing in an allergen. From the 1990s onward, there has been an upswing in the developed world in food allergies, including cow’s milk, peanut and egg allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RSLYT44TJFGGPBUJOWT6G2LPX4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urbanization, air pollution, dietary changes and an indoor lifestyle are often cited as possible factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="44OAN52KXNBFTMJ7FFRYU52ABI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02463.x" target="_blank"&gt;“hygiene hypothesis”&lt;/a&gt; — first proposed in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1838109/pdf/bmj00259-0027.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;1989 study by &lt;/a&gt;American immunologist David Strachan — suggests that early childhood exposure to microbes protects against allergic diseases by contributing to the development of a healthy immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJ62WORKQ5BDTDVCRKM3H2GVBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that hay fever and eczema were less common among children born into larger families.

Perhaps even more beneficial than having older siblings or pets, however, is growing up on a farm. (More than 150 years ago, hay fever was known as an &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/b20418620" target="_blank"&gt;“aristocratic disease,”&lt;/a&gt; almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society.

But even among farming communities, the most pronounced effect appears to be in the Amish.

The researchers first ruled out a genetic cause; in fact, an analysis showed that the Amish and Hutterite children were remarkably similar in their ancestral roots. Instead, the main difference between these two populations seemed to be the amount of exposure as young children to farm animals or barns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AYMREDE3LBF3JEFOSTKAWYPLSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm,” Ober said. “The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LSCZQF7BTVF6DMCG25AFYT73BQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When analyzing samples of Amish and Hutterite house dust, they found a microbial load almost seven times higher in Amish homes. Later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5495101/" target="_blank"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; showed that the airways of mice that inhaled Amish dust had dramatically reduced asthmalike symptoms when exposed to allergens. Mice that inhaled Hutterite dust did not receive the same benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ULV25BYEDZCTZLHJ5AANYVK4VU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now, Ober and Vercelli are beginning to identify the protective agents in Amish dust that prevent allergic asthma. In 2023, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674923007066" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of farm dust found proteins that act like delivery trucks, loaded with molecules produced by microbes and plants. When these transport proteins deliver their cargo to the mucus that lines the respiratory tract, it creates a protective environment that regulates airway responses and prevents inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZ757QVFS5ERPIHT5AM7ANSHCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We don’t really talk about the hygiene hypothesis as much anymore because we now understand that it’s not really about how hygienic you’re living,” said &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112360153-kirsi-m-jarvinen-seppo" target="_blank"&gt;Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Food Allergy at the University of Rochester Medical Center. “It’s more like a microbial hypothesis, since beneficial bacteria that colonize the gut and other mucosal surfaces play a significant role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65DZXHH6PJBSBHZIG6HNTODXBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During the first year or two of life, a baby’s immune system is rapidly developing and highly malleable by environmental stimuli, such as bacteria. Some experts believe that exposing young children to certain types of beneficial bacteria can engage and shape the growing immune system in a way that reduces the risk of allergic diseases later in life. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11877632/#imr70012-sec-0015" target="_blank"&gt;Farm dust&lt;/a&gt; contains a hodgepodge of bacteria shed from livestock and animal feed that isn’t harmful enough to cause illness, but does effectively train the immune system to become less responsive to allergens later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4DGEPS5T2BHWFM776J64JRMHBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2021, Järvinen-Seppo and her colleagues compared the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/all.14877?casa_token=ZKhKPcIO6EkAAAAA%3AFSy-TdwFIEjoHyTakQIWeE4hY6n9-xV0T6FwV6RJsSJvykykDmP1msQq-SviEXKQVCC91bzkWRhIqtM_" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; of 65 Old Order Mennonite infants from a rural community in New York with 39 urban/suburban infants from nearby Rochester. Like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites follow a traditional agrarian lifestyle. Almost three-fourths of Mennonite infants in the study were colonized with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;infantis&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium associated with lower rates of allergic diseases, in contrast to 21 percent of Rochester infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEBT7UXCKRC7ZKJG43NQQ7F4ZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The colonization rate is very low in the United States and other Western countries, compared to very high rates in Mennonite communities, similar to some developing countries,” Järvinen-Seppo said. “This mirrors the rates of autoimmune and allergic diseases.” These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases, Järvinen-Seppo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PCYTASANOND3PCLQ6UZ4ZGQX3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whatever form the treatment takes, the impact on prevention of allergic diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide and reduce quality of life, could be enormous, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3BE2HSKAQJDSJKV3ESBJQYEQXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. … But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed,” Vercelli said. “Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:31:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTVlacUprWlVoZ05VMWVSV09lcEhoSU1wNmVKNjAxX1lSYVYzNlNWT2c5YWpNU0h3dXNZeHBGbUplSFlkNDdVTGZoUW9JdEo3T0RfSXM2RUplVlVLN25XUzVyNkNZUkV4WFlibFFtdU5RTGFqSDI1MjNtaVZxdmVlTE9ZVlFScUE</guid></item><item><title>我在39岁时参加了第四次马拉松训练......然后被诊断出患有致命的癌症，在年轻人中爆发-每日邮报 | I was training for my fourth marathon at 39... then diagnosed with a deadly cancer exploding among young people - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lindsay Barad felt like she was in the best shape of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 39-year-old New Yorker had just run her fourth 26.2-mile marathon, and was avoiding &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-993a9400-6289-11f0-9784-357eae7e5d39" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and even eating clean. She felt unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just a month after the race in 2021, she was hit with a devastating diagnosis of stage four appendiceal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-88b27fc0-6348-11f0-ba8e-3b04051855cf"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and told she had hundreds of tumors scattered over her insides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had never even heard of this cancer,' Barad told DailyMail.com in an exclusive sit-down interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know it was possible. I was really, really shocked. I had no other symptoms; I just thought this was some kind of endometriosis, something like that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Appendiceal cancer, or appendix cancer, is now the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14794291/cancer-exploding-millennials-quicker-colon-doctors-warn.html"&gt;fastest-rising cancer&lt;/a&gt; among under-50s, with young adults today being up to seven times more likely to develop the disease as in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barad is among the latest young adults to be diagnosed with the disease and, like many others, said she has no idea why she developed it, despite her healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also has no idea when it started. She had heavy periods, menstrual cramps and bloating for as long as she could remember, which can be symptoms of appendicceal cancer, but had always played them down as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;VID HERE PLEASE PUT LIVE: 3477873 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindsay Barad was diagnosed with stage four appendiceal cancer at age 39 years when she thought she was in the best shape of her life. She is shown above at her 40th birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors had dismissed them too, saying they were 'just something women go through' and putting her on birth control and over-the-counter painkillers to reduce her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in late 2021, after she changed gynecologist, Barad was recommended for an ultrasound on the pretence of getting an IUD, or small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan revealed a grapefruit-sized cyst on her right ovary, despite the fact that ovaries are only about three to five centimeters long. This was also very large for Barad, who is just 5ft 1in tall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed into surgery, but during the procedure doctors noted a strange mucus in her abdominal cavity and that her appendix was swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They removed her appendix and sent it for testing, along with her cyst, right ovary and right fallopian tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few weeks later, in December 2021, she was called back into her doctor's office to be given the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barad said: 'It's hard to figure out when was that quote-unquote normal [menstrual cramps] versus when did I have appendix cancer, and that was what was making the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What was a red flag symptom was close to my diagnosis I had to urinate a lot, and I would notice every time I would drink something I would have to use the bathroom. I always felt the need to pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad was an avid runner before the diagnosis, and was training for her fourth marathon when she was told she had appendiceal cancer. It came as a total shock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it turned out that was because I had a huge ovarian cyst and it was taking up space where my bladder is and that was me needing to urinate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Appendiceal cancer has no clear symptoms, especially in its early stages, meaning doctors often struggle to diagnose the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is rare, with about 3,000 cases every year, and normally diagnosed in people around 50 and 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as cases have risen among younger adults, researchers have suggested that shifts in the microbiome caused by the western diet could be raising the risk of developing the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also one of the leading theories linked to a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13271881/colon-cancer-mystery-causing-rise-young-people.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer &lt;/a&gt;in young people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are several types of the cancer, but Barad was diagnosed with&lt;span&gt; low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN), a rare and slow-growing form where cells in the appendix overproduce mucin — a jelly-like substance — that can flood the abdominal cavity and push other cells into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This disruption in the body's internal cavity can cause a large cyst to develop on an ovary, like in Barad's case, or on another organ of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It isn't clear how often this form of the disease affects patients, but some studies on only a small number of patients have suggested it is around 40 percent of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat her cancer, Barad was brought in for a major 12-hour surgery in March 2022 to try to clear the disease from her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the procedure, surgeons initially made an incision from her chest to her pelvis and opened up her body, before trying to remove as much of mucin as possible that was coating each organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad is pictured above following surgery to remove the cancer from the inside of her body. She was told she had hundreds of tiny tumors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They removed part of her liver, omentum - the thin tissue surrounding the stomach - and part of her diaphragm during the surgery because these were covered in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also said they might have to remove her uterus, leaving Barad unable to start a family, but managed to save the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, doctors pumped her abdominal cavity full of chemotherapy drugs heated to 106F (41C), sewed her up and rotated her for about 90 minutes. She was rotated to spread the chemotherapy drugs in her abdomen to treat any remaining cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs were then extracted, and Barad said she went through months of a 'miserable' recovery where she was so unwell she was barely able to leave the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the surgery was a success, and the cancer has not been detected in Barad since. She now returns every year to the hospital to check for recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Appendix cancer is slow-growing, however, with Barad saying that she will never be considered 'cured,' just 'in remission' because of the risk more cancerous cells could appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It's so slow moving, it could be slowly growing over the next couple of years, so it's uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But every year now I get scans and blood work done and I feel like I am just in really good hands with all of this.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad, who is from New York City, is now living an intentional life, and is thankful for those around her and enjoying going on long hikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She was treated for the cancer in a grueling 12-hour surgery, but said she has not needed any further surgery or chemotherapy since&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Survival rates for appendix cancer vary widely depending on the type and how advanced the cancer is,&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancercenter.com/cancer-types/appendix-cancer/stages"&gt; with between&lt;/a&gt; 67 and 97 percent of patients living for longer than five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For LAMN, about 64 percent of patients survive for longer than five years according &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6524118/"&gt;to studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amid her recovery, Barad said she is now trying to live an intentional life and is thankful for the people around her and aiming to raise awareness about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lives in her apartment with her dog Charlie, a rescued Maltese poodle mix, and keeps active with long hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had her eggs frozen at age 35 in case she wanted to start a family but now says she doesn't think she wants to put her body through the trial of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barad is thankful that her cancer was slow growing but fears the outcome if it had not been detected earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was helped through her journey by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmppals.net/"&gt;PMP Pals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.abdominalcancers.org/"&gt;Abdominal Cancers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which aim to help patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The research tracked over a thousand women across the United States and found that exposure to concentrated neighborhood poverty was linked to sharper drops in episodic memory over time. The decline was most pronounced among Black women. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70139" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier research has shown that people in lower-income neighborhoods face higher risks for various health conditions, including memory decline and dementia, most studies have examined each person’s immediate residential area in isolation. They often did not consider how poor neighborhoods might be clustered together or how neighborhood conditions change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown that people living in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to develop various physical and mental illnesses and tend to have shorter lifespans than people living in higher-income areas. However, people’s neighborhood exposures are not restricted to the immediate areas around their homes, as they tend to actively seek resources, such as food, from nearby neighborhoods to meet their daily needs,” said study author &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/15867/jinshil-hyun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jinshil Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that individuals living in low-income neighborhoods might successfully access better resources elsewhere, unless their communities are surrounded entirely by other low-income neighborhoods. In such cases, their access would be severely restricted, potentially harming their health-related behaviors and health outcomes. We chose to investigate whether living in areas of more concentrated poverty affects cognitive health among midlife women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the researchers considered both the person’s neighborhood and the surrounding areas to measure concentrated poverty. They also accounted for changes in address over time, allowing them to assess long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage. Rather than relying on general cognitive tests, the researchers focused on specific cognitive skills that often decline with age: processing speed, working memory, and episodic memory. The goal was to understand whether living in high-poverty “hot spots” during midlife would predict declines in these areas—and whether the effects differed across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;a href="https://www.swanstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN)&lt;/a&gt; provided the opportunity to examine this question using data collected over (up to 14 years of data) in women at over midlife women from 5 sites in the United States,” Hyun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 1,391 women from Ann Arbor, Boston, Chicago, Alameda and Contra Costa County, Los Angeles, Jersey City, and Pittsburgh. Participants ranged in age from 49 to 60 at the study’s cognitive starting point. The researchers followed them for up to 13.5 years and conducted repeated assessments of their memory and thinking abilities. They also gathered information on a range of factors known to influence brain health, including education, menopause status, financial hardship, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure neighborhood poverty, the researchers used U.S. Census data to calculate poverty rates in each participant’s home census tract and the surrounding tracts. They categorized neighborhoods into three levels: low, moderate, and high concentrated poverty. High-concentration areas were defined as those with unusually high poverty rates that were geographically clustered. These designations took into account how often participants moved and how their neighborhood conditions changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main finding was that women living in high concentrated poverty areas experienced a faster decline in episodic memory, which includes both immediate and delayed recall of information. Episodic memory is the ability to remember specific events or pieces of information from one’s own experience. Unlike processing speed, which naturally tends to decline in midlife, episodic memory often remains more stable. A sharper-than-expected decline in this type of memory during midlife can be an early warning sign of cognitive problems later in life, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women living in high-poverty neighborhoods saw a 7% decline in immediate and delayed episodic memory over a 10-year span. The decline in delayed recall was even steeper—about 10%—for Black women living in those same neighborhoods. In contrast, women living in lower poverty areas either did not experience this level of decline or saw only mild reductions. This pattern remained consistent even when accounting for differences in education, smoking, alcohol use, menopause status, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing speed and working memory were also affected by neighborhood poverty but in different ways. Women in poorer neighborhoods had lower average scores on these tests at the start of the study. However, the rate at which these abilities declined over time did not differ significantly across neighborhood types. This suggests that neighborhood poverty may shape baseline brain health but does not necessarily speed up age-related decline in all cognitive areas equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Experiencing cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, and different aspects of cognition decline at different rates,” Hyun told PsyPost. “For example, processing speed typically starts to slow down in early adulthood, while memory usually remains stable until later in life. However, our study revealed that women living in areas of concentrated poverty experienced accelerated memory decline even during midlife (approximately 7% per decade). Those living in higher income areas did not show significant memory decline. This suggests that living in highly concentrated low-income neighborhoods may be related to increased rates of cognitive aging, potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether other factors could explain the link between neighborhood poverty and memory decline, the researchers considered cardiovascular health risks and physical activity levels. Both are known to influence cognitive function. However, these factors did not fully explain the memory differences observed in this study. This indicates that other pathways—possibly involving chronic stress, environmental toxins, or reduced access to stimulating environments—may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was not surprised that living in high-poverty neighborhoods was associated with faster cognitive decline, but the magnitude of this effect was unexpectedly large,” Hyun said. “While residents of affluent neighborhoods showed no significant memory decline, residents of areas with concentrated poverty experienced a 7% decline per decade. Greater memory decline in midlife could serve as an early indicator of future Alzheimer’s risk. Alzheimer’s disease currently has no cure, and effective treatment options are limited. Therefore, addressing neighborhood and individual risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease as early as in midlife would be crucial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether the effects of neighborhood poverty varied by race and ethnicity. They found that Black women living in high-poverty areas experienced the most rapid decline in delayed episodic memory. This may reflect the compounding effects of systemic disadvantage, such as racial discrimination and economic segregation, which can create chronic stress and limit access to health-promoting resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. For instance, the sample was drawn from urban areas, and the results may not apply to women living in rural settings. The study also did not account for neighborhood conditions earlier in life, which may have lasting effects on brain health. In addition, the study focused on where participants lived, not where they worked or spent their daily routines. These places may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the study found links between living in areas of concentrated poverty and memory decline, it could not confirm exactly how this relationship works. Future research is needed to identify which neighborhood features—such as access to parks, quality of schools, exposure to air pollution, or social cohesion—might influence cognitive aging. Real-time location tracking and environmental data could help researchers understand how different places shape health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to better understand how people move through and use their surrounding areas in daily life,” Hyun said. “In a different study, the Einstein Aging Study, we are collecting GPS data from individuals to see whether their ability to travel to different neighborhoods is limited by where they live. By identifying these patterns, we can suggest targeted solutions that address both community-level factors (like improving neighborhood conditions) and personal-level strategies to support healthier lifestyles. Ultimately, our goal is to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Alzheimer’s Association, the Sylvia and Leonard Marx Foundation, and the Czap Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70139" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exposure to neighborhood concentrated poverty is associated with faster decline in episodic memory among midlife women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jinshil Hyun, Mary Schiff, Charles B.

It wasn't until 2021 when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she saw limited improvements from birth control, diet and exercise, Hamilton joined a trial in 2024 examining a GLP-1 drug in PCOS patients. By October, she received her first weekly dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s obesity injection Wegovy and diabetes shot Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said some results were almost immediate: after months without a cycle, her period resumed within two weeks of starting the drug. After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. Treating PCOS is among several new but unapproved potential uses of the blockbuster drugs beyond promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174095" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Grace Hamilton, a patient with PCOS talking GLP-1s in Galway, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Addison Peacock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCOS, which is frequently underdiagnosed, affects an estimated 5 million to 6 million women of reproductive age in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/pcos" target="_blank"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is typically characterized by higher levels of testosterone and other hormones usually associated with men called androgens, which can leads to symptoms such as irregular and painful periods, excess hair growth and acne. PCOS is the most common cause of infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is strongly linked to metabolic issues, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8984569/" target="_blank"&gt;an estimated 35% to 80% of patients &lt;/a&gt;experience insulin resistance. That means the pancreas pumps out more insulin to keep blood sugar in check, and high insulin levels can promote weight gain and disrupt hormone balance. A significant share of women with PCOS have obesity or Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there's no standard PCOS treatment. Current options like birth control, lifestyle changes and the diabetes drug Metformin may only help with certain symptoms, which could differ depending on the patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health experts see promise in GLP-1s, particularly given their effect on improving weight loss and insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unmet need is massive," said Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Colorado. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. She previously studied the oral form of semaglutide and has an ongoing clinical trial on the injectable version, which is what Hamilton participated in for 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her studies are still small in comparison to drugmakers' previous clinical trials on GLP-1s with thousands of patients. Not all of the women who have so far completed Cree's ongoing study lost significant weight, demonstrating that not everyone may respond to GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk and rival &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been studying their GLP-1s as potential treatments for other chronic conditions like fatty liver disease, but not PCOS. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting longer and larger trials to better understand the effect of GLP-1s on PCOS symptoms is crucial, said Sasha Ottey, executive director of the advocacy group PCOS Challenge. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that certain patients may not lose weight on GLP-1s, and others may not need to shed pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, insurance coverage for GLP-1s is a barrier for some PCOS patients, who are often eligible for approved uses of the drugs. Most plans cover GLP-1s for diabetes, but not for obesity or unapproved uses. The drugs can cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance. Still, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk offer significant discounts on their drugs to some patients who pay for it out-of-pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the body respond better to insulin, so it doesn't need to produce as much of it to manage blood sugar. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the questions was, what other methods do we have to improve insulin sensitivity?" Cree said. She noted that other recommended treatments for PCOS symptoms, such as food changes, increasing exercise and the diabetes drug Metformin, are based on that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1s such as semaglutide improve insulin sensitivity and reduce appetite through several mechanisms. That includes slowing how quickly food leaves the stomach, prompting the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar is high and suppressing the release of a hormone that raises blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weight loss caused by GLP-1s further helps improve insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107393750" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Daniel Grill | Tetra Images | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early results from Cree's ongoing study support the idea that GLP-1s may lower testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05819853" target="_blank"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, which began in 2023, follows girls and women ages 12 to 35 with obesity and PCOS who are on or off Metformin. The study is designed to administer semaglutide to patients for 10 months, and examine their weight loss, metabolic changes and improvements in reproductive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree hopes the trial will answer whether GLP-1s can improve ovulation in women with PCOS. Many women with PCOS don't ovulate regularly, which can lead to irregular periods and difficulty getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree has initial data on 11 women who completed the 10 months on semaglutide and were not on Metformin. She said eight of them lost more than 10% of their body weight and saw a reduction in their testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five out of the eight patients had their testosterone levels reach "normal ranges," Cree said. Meanwhile, six out of the eight patients reported more regular periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree said her trial will eventually have data from 40 women, but she is still enrolling patients in the group that takes Metformin. She said it will likely take two years before she publishes the first results from the study, which will focus on the differences in outcomes between kids and adults who only received semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said comparing the groups is crucial because hormones that control growth are released during puberty, which could change how kids respond to GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all women with PCOS will benefit from taking a GLP-1. Cree said in her trial, three patients who completed 10 months on semaglutide did not lose at least 10% of their body weight. One of those women did not lose weight at all, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree said that's consistent with previous studies on GLP-1s in adults with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of GLP-1s in improving symptoms, more research is also needed on PCOS itself, said Dr. Karen Tang, an OB-GYN and founder of Thrive Gynecology. She said some people can experience hallmark symptoms of the condition, such as facial hair and acne, even though they have normal levels of testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot that's very much unknown about PCOS and exactly how the disease kind of works," Tang told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;GLP-1s give some patients a big boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests GLP-1s may address more than just weight issues for people with PCOS. In &lt;a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/research-library/do-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-affect-the-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients with PCOS may also lose more weight on GLP-1s than those without the condition, said Dr. Kerry Krauss, an OB/GYN and medical director at Natural Cycles, who has PCOS herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research needs to confirm those benefits, but she said it gives hope to many PCOS patients who are frustrated with common treatments for the condition. Those options typically target just one aspect of PCOS, such as reducing androgen levels with certain types of birth control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174132" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Haley Sipes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the case for Haley Sipes, a 31-year-old mother of three based in Western Kentucky who experienced PCOS symptoms for years without a diagnosis. In 2022, before being diagnosed, she lost 75 pounds over 10 months through diet and exercise alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her progress stalled in late 2022 despite an intense diet and exercise regimen, and her weight began to fluctuate in 2023. By mid-2024, she had regained about 30 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes sought help from her primary care provider and underwent blood work, which revealed she had a hormonal imbalance. Initial efforts to regulate her hormones with progesterone and testosterone had a limited effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further bloodwork diagnosed Sipes with PCOS and insulin resistance, which she views as the root cause of her weight loss struggles. She recalled bloating, fatigue, low energy, and water retention during earlier efforts to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her history of painful, irregular periods and ovarian cysts since age 10, her providers never mentioned PCOS as a possible diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, her doctor prescribed Zepbound. Her insurance covered it due to her BMI and prediabetes status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes said she noticed changes within the first month: her food cravings quieted, her inflammation decreased, she experienced less joint pain, and her period became less painful and occurred more regularly. Sipes added that she has not had ovarian cysts since starting Zepbound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After around eight months on the medication, she lost more than 60 pounds. Sipes said those results significantly improved her emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just a better version of myself when I'm not controlled by food thoughts and hormonal issues that cause mood swings," she continued. "My life does feel so much more enjoyable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes plans to continue taking Zepbound to maintain her results, possibly at lower doses. She noted that more research is needed on whether PCOS symptoms can fully resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Insurance coverage is a challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance coverage is currently the biggest hurdle preventing PCOS patients from accessing GLP-1s, said Dr. Alyssa Dominguez, an endocrinologist with Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. She said many PCOS patients are eligible to use GLP-1s for their approved uses based on BMI or related conditions, but may not have coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ifebp.org/resources---news/survey-reports/glp-1-drugs-us--2025-pulse-survey" target="_blank"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, President Donald Trump rejected a Biden administration plan that would have required Medicare and Medicaid to cover obesity drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174099" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Nabeelah Karim is a patient with PCOS who took GLP-1s to manage her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Nabeelah Karim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients, like 34-year-old California mom Nabeelah Karim, have turned to other options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim was diagnosed with PCOS at 19 and took birth control on and off until giving birth in 2021. She said she struggled with hair loss, irregular periods, debilitating cramps, facial hair growth, severe water retention and mood swings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim said her period symptoms worsened after she gave birth, and in late 2023, she began what would be a painful five-month-long period. Doctors suggested that she lose weight, take painkillers or return to birth control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Karim lost some weight through diet and exercise, she was eventually prescribed Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro through the digital health startup Noom in April 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her long period stopped and symptoms eased within days, and she began to lose more weight over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It had solved all the problems that I had experienced for years up until that point," Karim said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her insurance plan never formally approved or denied coverage of Mounjaro, forcing her to pay its more than $1,000 per month out-of-pocket price. She eventually found a third-party compounding pharmacy that accepted her prescription, allowing her to buy a cheaper but unapproved version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim used that compounded version for six months and continued to experience weight loss and improvements to her PCOS symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During FDA&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages" target="_blank"&gt;-declared shortages&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and some health experts have pushed back – and in some cases, taken legal action – against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs. The FDA has declared U.S. shortages of both companies' drugs over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When people ask about how safe compounded drugs are, the answer I typically give is I don't know," said Dominguez from USC's School of Medicine. She said that's unlike branded drugs, which have clearly defined risks and benefits proven in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamilton, the 27-year-old patient who took a GLP-1 for PCOS symptoms, has never taken a compounded GLP-1. She is currently appealing her insurer's denial of semaglutide now that she has completed Cree's trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My whole life has been an inability to access care for my medical condition, and I'm tired of that," she said. "If somebody would have been able to provide 11-year-old Grace with this drug, that would have saved me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 12:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNdHVUNThYbGhqUkxMc19PSThDQzlBdHlmWmluc1pjZUhIbU5iZ2NqRmF6TExqVDU1WmZzOEs3V1pIaE43blBYZDJldDEtWTBfUFFEYWRoajhRZFBBSF9WRFZnV3pyMG1vSkdJYmFqaWZDWVc3dVVIbGhyaDQtSlpVQkF30gGHAUFVX3lxTFBYb0hYNlVKZE9GVzlzRTdiQnhzLXRNZ3RZSXZKaDhvSTRSUjgzbTlmVjkwWlVpM1JILUZ5SmFrVHI3aEROWlZUcWFXYWFZMmFpckF0UGhEQlp3UGNwNmx2aXp4c3JEM2FKOUVOZHB3ZXZ6Sjh6ZnhTRHZYTUk1eFFzcWV2MDBaTQ</guid></item><item><title>这种健康状况与痴呆症有着惊人的联系-旧金山纪事报 | This health condition has a surprising link with dementia - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNVlFxUENhTGNteW1mcHBJb0FxZ00yZVhOelZqNmh1eGFrQmdJVjI2U3lDbU5Ic1VIb0F0QXlsMVNKa29MdmZEVndlcjhpeTFVZUdmU2k4QnFBUFJ3UDBJU2F5UUN2TXhGMXRYR0w3TDFmME5QQVJHQU5VRGtrQzZnWGFSZURnc3lOc012TC1pUktCUC1RdU1yTjVoemg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Last year the National Cancer Registry reported an estimated 641 cases of new HPV-associated cancers diagnosed and 196 cancer deaths every year in Ireland, most of which are potentially preventable by vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Women are twice as likely to die from such illnesses as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Minister for Health &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/jennifer-carroll-macneill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/jennifer-carroll-macneill/"&gt;Jennifer Carroll MacNeill&lt;/a&gt; “has decided to introduce a schools-based HPV vaccine catch-up programme without delay”, Mr Harris said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“This will give students who have previously been offered a HPV vaccine another opportunity to receive that vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;However, Green Party leader &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/roderic-o-gorman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/roderic-o-gorman/"&gt;Roderic O’Gorman&lt;/a&gt; said the vaccine would cost €600 for anyone who has already finished school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Raising the issue in the Dáil this week he highlighted the case of 20-year-old Lucy, who missed the HPV vaccine when she was at school and who wants to take it up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“The cost of the initial appointment with a practice nurse, multiple shots and multiple GP visits to get those shots totals is €600. She is a third-level student. She does not have that level of disposable income.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;He asked: “Why does she have to fork out €600? Why does she have to pay for potentially life-saving shots when just six months ago the Government committed to rerunning the Laura Brennan HPV vaccine catch-up campaign?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The Tánaiste said “the Minister is exploring opportunities to identify a suitable delivery model for those aged under 25 who have left school. In the meantime, it is important to have as many children of school-going age as possible vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;When Mr O’Gorman said Lucy would not benefit from the programme the Tánaiste replied: “we have to start.

During the course of seven days, which included three weekdays and one weekend day, the participants wore a wristband accelerometer, which provided a daily detailed summary of any light (washing the dishes, walking the dog, a stroll to the photocopier), moderate (brisk walking, playing tag, moving, carrying, or pushing around things like a lawnmower) and vigorous (short jog, quickly climbing stairs, or more intense gardening like hoeing or digging up weeds) incidental physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up with the study subjects eight years later revealed the effects of the various levels of IPA in regards to cardiovascular risk. &lt;strong&gt;The median dose of vigorous (4.6 minutes a day) and moderate (23.8 to 23.9 minutes a day) incidental physical activity was associated with 25% to 38% and 40% to 50% lower risk of cardiovascular events (including deaths), respectively.&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of preventing heart disease deaths and major cardiovascular events, the researchers learned that &lt;strong&gt;1 minute of vigorous IPA was equal to 2.8 to 3.4 minutes of moderate IPA&lt;/strong&gt; and 35 to 48 minutes of light IPA. &lt;strong&gt;Essentially, 3 minutes of moderate activity every day while you're doing chores could lower your risk for heart problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this means for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, the message is very clear, according to Stamatakis. “Know that no movement is wasted and all of it counts. &lt;strong&gt;Use any opportunity in life to move at higher intensity, like using stairs instead of elevators or parking your car further away,” he says. “You’ll improve the function of your heart and vessels and your body will respond positively.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb of how to determine what’s light, moderate and what’s vigorous incidental physical activity is to use the singing, speaking rule, suggests Stamatakis. “If someone can comfortably sing or speak while doing activity that means it’s light intensity, when people are doing moderate activity, you can still speak, but singing isn’t possible anymore, and when you hit vigorous intensity, you shouldn’t be able to speak or sing while doing it,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, the study shows shorter spurts of activity can help protect your heart, but that doesn’t mean you should give up exercising on the regular.&lt;/strong&gt; You should still aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week and when your schedule is tight, amp up the intensity of your everyday chores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 11:08:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBYWFNkR2FmM3NkUV9QbmZCdHVCTTQ1LXB2d3dwUGEzTllpcG1kVUhDbDhXb2xBSXkxVnJMaEh5M1dRREczNEszR1VmMW04YW1kUkpsdWFIdnU2Z3BHUHZNUy1sMEFQQUY3bjRiQ3Y5dw</guid></item><item><title>“不要吃生食” ：潜伏在夏威夷的可怕威胁- SFGATE | 'Don't eat raw food': The terrifying threat lurking in Hawaii - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPSVA2S3JXQVJQLUNJdU9MYjBpcVhmT3U3cUhBdDdHYmhZSG8xcFJfQ3Z1ZUFwa0xoR2l6aUFJLVRkZ2xrMHlaN3daLVhaNi1uS3d1eGVpcXVPUE0ySHpzYm1tMW8zaGZvVHdEandpdWZ1aTF0STlKSkRoS2xGR0RjeWZNTEdHWnU2cUc3MklsNGNwUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

You're not alone. About 800 million people around the world experience low back pain, and it is a leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life. While over-the-counter medications and ointments may provide some relief, it does not solve the problem in the long term. A recent study has shown that a simple exercise can fix it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A clinical trial led by researchers at Macquarie University’s Spinal Pain Research Group found that a simple exercise, when done regularly, can fix lower back pain. The findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00755-4/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Exercise and back pain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low back pain affects millions of people globally. Repeated episodes of low back pain are also very common, with seven in 10 people who recover from an episode going on to have a recurrence within a year. The current best practice recommended to manage and prevent back pain is a combination of exercise and education. However, many cannot exercise due to accessibility or affordability, due to their high cost, complexity, and need for supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have found that a simple exercise, which is accessible and does not cost a penny, could solve this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercise in question is simple walking. They found that adults with a history of low back pain went nearly twice as long without a recurrence of their back pain if they walked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clinical trial, the researchers looked at whether walking could be an effective, cost-effective, and accessible intervention. To study this, the researchers followed 701 adults who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain. The participants of the trial were then randomly given either an individualised walking program and six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, or assigned to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed these participants between one and three years, depending on when they joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that walking has a profound effect on how low back pain is managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,” Mark Hancock, senior author and Professor of Physiotherapy at Macquarie University, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can walking help?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that walking could be instrumental in managing and even preventing low back pain. “Walking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status. We don’t know exactly why walking is so good for preventing back pain, but it is likely to include the combination of the gentle oscillatory movements, loading and strengthening the spinal structures and muscles, relaxation and stress relief, and release of ‘feel-good’ endorphins. And of course, we also know that walking comes with many other health benefits, including cardiovascular health, bone density, healthy weight, and improved mental health,” Hancock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Body pain in women linked to their belly fat!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author of the study, Dr Natasha Pocovi, also added that the program was very cost-effective. “It not only improved people’s quality of life, but it reduced their need both to seek healthcare support and the amount of time taken off work by approximately half. The exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients. Our study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shruti Haasan Reacts To Justin Bieber's Online Meltdowns| 'Planetary Mental Health In Shambles'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now planning to explore how they can integrate the preventive approach into the routine care of patients who experience recurrent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/back-pain-is-the-new-pandemic-know-its-cause-and-4-expert-approved-exercises-you-should-start-now/articleshow/122277063.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;low back pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxOVXdZcWplWnJhV1VmSUdoNkFJSThHeW1DNmpwRWk0WjNRQUg0dHc3N2hCSV9EcWVyVHpxYXFyYmY5Z1M2LWJWV2ZZWFZaaFVlWUdyTkZFbngzYzNBTE5mQ1JtUXc5YTNBaURLZC1rMTRUUEhVN1MyOWlkN2hxaUZNazJWNE9WcTBGb25GeEUxeE5WdXczR1JmRGxOV2hYWndLeS1qaFhZZUVfdGFXdUpxNGlyWkNXT3B4WnBNYWFWYVFFdmdNSVZfM1pFRlI4NEtzZGQ3WjBITWNpMWQwNVIyS0Q1VFhPQ0V3QUxZT2ZRUXZzdkdLaHc</guid></item><item><title>科学家揭示了一种普遍存在但先前未知的心理现象--PsyPost | Scientists reveal a widespread but previously unidentified psychological phenomenon - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPTVBBVUZlN3VHYnZ5SUNSbTJoS1EzUlJ5ekJMZWxzV2VJbVE4bFhNU2VZdXFfdEk2Z0hDR2pIaDk4QmhXQmdKNERnckk4OVB4Tnd5dlNoczMtaTJURjZhb3FrdGFhTWdENF9SeDN4SEtGTFhJdnVTOFA2U0lLU214Wm5CdUZVUHI1T0d3WnlFRWR4b1V6T0hMMHhFSWRKdDB3MWpBSlFPWERvVHNi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people will continue with a longer, less efficient path to a goal rather than backtrack and take a shortcut — even when the backtracking would save time and effort. A new series of studies published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251331053" target="_blank"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that this behavior, called “doubling-back aversion,” emerges in both physical and mental tasks, and is driven not by mistaken cost estimates but by how people think about their past and future effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long studied why people stick with inefficient paths. The status quo bias describes the tendency to prefer current arrangements, while the sunk-cost fallacy highlights how people keep investing in failing efforts to justify past choices. But these don’t quite explain situations where people are choosing among equally new options — except that one feels like it erases what’s already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two researchers at UC Berkeley — &lt;a href="https://kristinecho.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Kristine Y. Cho&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student, and &lt;a href="http://claytoncritcher.squarespace.com/;jsessionid=2861647ADF2B5CEC15922A1BB1E7D991.v5-web004" target="_blank"&gt;Clayton R. Critcher&lt;/a&gt;, the Joe Shoong Professor of Business — sought to investigate whether people really do avoid doubling back, even when it’s objectively better, and to identify why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We both had a strong intuition that we kept circling back to as we developed our research,” Cho explained. “The idea was this: Imagine you’re walking from your house to a friend’s place. You leave your front door, turn left, and head down the block. But then you realize that you would get there faster if you had gone right instead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, you’re still close enough to home that retracing your steps, passing your front door, and taking the better route would actually save time. But would most people actually turn around and walk past where they started? We didn’t think so. That reluctance to reverse course, even when it’s clearly better, seemed to pop up a lot in real life. So we set out to investigate it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across four experiments involving more than 2,500 adults from the United States, researchers tested whether people avoided more efficient strategies if they involved retracing their steps or restarting a task. The studies used both virtual navigation and cognitive tasks to examine the phenomenon in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, college students used a virtual reality interface to move from one location to another. After walking a short distance, they encountered a map offering two paths to the destination. One path was shorter but required them to double back — literally reversing the steps they had just taken. Even though the shorter route would get them there faster, many avoided it when it required backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies replaced physical movement with mental effort. In one task, participants had to generate 40 words starting with the letter “G.” After listing 10, they were given a choice: continue with “G” words or switch to “T” words — a task expected to be easier. The tasks were objectively equivalent except for one difference: in one version, the new task was described as “starting over” and discarding previous work, while in the other version, it was described as “continuing the task under new instructions.” Both versions involved writing 30 more words, but only the “start over” version framed the switch as undoing progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a third experiment, the researchers split doubling back into two components: deleting past work and having to complete the entire task from the beginning again. They manipulated how each component was framed and assessed how participants responded. The final study added a more detailed set of questions to examine how participants viewed their past and future efforts depending on their decision to switch tasks or stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all four studies, people consistently avoided options that involved doubling back, even when those options saved time. In the virtual reality study, only 31% of participants chose the shorter path when it required retracing their steps, compared to nearly 57% when it did not. In the word-generation tasks, framing the switch as “starting over” reduced the likelihood of switching from 75% to just 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sheer size of the effect caught us off guard,” Cho told PsyPost. “For instance, take Study 2 in our paper. In that study, we told participants that they would have to list 40 words starting with the letter ‘G.’ But after they listed 10 words starting with ‘G’, we gave them the option to switch to listing words starting with the letter ‘T’. Because more words in the English language start with ‘T’ than ‘G’, switching essentially made the task easier. And when the choice was framed simply as a choice to switch letters for the remainder of the task, 75% of participants did indeed choose to switch to the easier task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when the choice was framed as ‘doubling back,’ that is, discarding their progress and starting over on a new task with 30 new ‘T’ words, only 25% switched. The contrast was so stark that my first reaction was to suspect a coding error, that maybe we had accidentally reversed the responses. But after carefully checking the data multiple times, we confirmed it was correct. The effect wasn’t just real, it was strikingly strong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this aversion was not explained by a belief that the backtracking route would take longer. Participants generally understood that switching would save time. But they still chose to stay the course when switching was described as discarding previous work or restarting the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that doubling-back aversion was driven by how people mentally interpreted their efforts. When switching tasks was framed as undoing work, participants felt that their earlier effort had been wasted. This made the remaining work feel less like a path to success and more like an uphill slog. The effect was stronger when participants believed they had to start from scratch rather than continue with a portion of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aversion was strongest when both components of doubling back were present — undoing past work and starting over with a full task. But each factor independently contributed to the effect. In other words, people were less likely to switch to a faster strategy even if only one part of doubling back was invoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested whether participants’ decisions were shaped by how much time they thought each path would take. Although people generally did think switching would be quicker, these perceptions didn’t fully explain their choices. Instead, people were more influenced by subjective impressions about what switching meant for their progress and future effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that people often avoid backtracking, even when changing course would clearly get them to their goal faster,” Cho explained. “This hesitation stems from a discomfort with ‘wasting’ past effort, but in reality, refusing to double back often leads to even more wasted time and energy. Our key takeaway is this: Progress isn’t always about pushing forward. Sometimes, the smartest move is to step back, reassess, and choose the better path, even if it means undoing what’s already been done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the experiments captured doubling-back aversion in controlled settings, real-life decisions are often messier. Future research might explore how this bias plays out in more complex or emotionally charged scenarios — such as changing careers, relationships, or long-term projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We examined doubling back aversion in the context of tasks that take just a few minutes to complete,” Cho noted. “But we expect that if anything, for more complex and longer tasks, doubling back aversion might be even stronger as people might become even more averse to viewing their longer past efforts as a waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies also did not test ways to reduce doubling-back aversion. However, the researchers suggested that encouraging people to focus on future gains rather than past losses could help. For example, reframing a switch as a time-saving opportunity rather than a “restart” may reduce resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This focus on how people mentally frame past effort and future potential has also shaped the researchers’ broader work. As Cho explained: “In our work on doubling-back aversion, we explored how people resist switching tactics midway, even when doing so would help them reach their goals more efficiently. More recently, we’ve been examining a related form of hesitation. This time, it’s not in switching paths, but in committing to one at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it might seem that having enticing options (e.g., a great apartment one could rent, a fun event one could sign up for) would make commitment easier, we’ve found that it’s often the loss of a great option that finally pushes people to choose. People often hold out for something even better, but the disappearance of a pretty good option inspires some pessimism that encourages people to grab onto what is as good as they can get for now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A theme that this suggests is that people are too past focused, worrying about feeling that they have made good use of their time and efforts,” Cho added. “But people need to recognize that the past is fixed, and it is only the future we can control. We need to be willing to accept that we may have made some mistakes along the way, but that is never too late to change course, especially when doing so will get us to where we want to go more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251331053" target="_blank"&gt;Doubling-Back Aversion: A Reluctance to Make Progress by Undoing It&lt;/a&gt;,” was published May 9, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 10:02:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPTVBBVUZlN3VHYnZ5SUNSbTJoS1EzUlJ5ekJMZWxzV2VJbVE4bFhNU2VZdXFfdEk2Z0hDR2pIaDk4QmhXQmdKNERnckk4OVB4Tnd5dlNoczMtaTJURjZhb3FrdGFhTWdENF9SeDN4SEtGTFhJdnVTOFA2U0lLU214Wm5CdUZVUHI1T0d3WnlFRWR4b1V6T0hMMHhFSWRKdDB3MWpBSlFPWERvVHNi</guid></item><item><title>我们的身体是由真菌镶嵌而成的。一些科学家认为他们可能会影响我们的大脑- BBC | Our body is a mosaic of fungi.

The disease is reported more among men (40%), when compared to women (26%). If caught early, NAFLD can often be reversed. Here are seven evidence-based strategies to restore liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Say no to sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sugar is the biggest enemy of your liver. When you consume too much sugar, especially &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5893377/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;fructose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (found in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup), your liver has to process it. Over time, too much fructose overwhelms the liver, leading to fat buildup in the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also cause inflammation and liver damage. Excess sugar intake increases insulin resistance, which can worsen liver health and increase risk of type 2 diabetes. Cutting back on sugar, even for a month, can reduce liver fat significantly. To protect your liver, eliminate sodas, fruit juices, candied fruits, and foods that contain high-fructose corn syrup. Instead, opt for whole fruits in moderation to satisfy sweet cravings without overloading the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Incorporate intermittent fasting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting, where you eat food within an 8–10-hour window, followed by 14–16 hours of fasting, can be beneficial for the liver. This approach triggers autophagy, the body’s process of clearing damaged cells, which supports liver health. Changes such as eating an early dinner can improve liver function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10564080/#s0005" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have found that intermittent fasting positively affects NAFLD through a number of different physiological pathways. These include improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, modulation of lipid metabolism, induction of autophagy, modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulation of gut microbiota. However, intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, so it is important that you consult a healthcare professional before starting intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Move more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is key to reversing fatty liver, even without weight loss. A combination of cardio and strength training can make a significant impact on your health. Aim for three weekly sessions of weightlifting and three cardio workouts, complemented by 8,000–10,000 daily steps. Exercise will enhance insulin sensitivity, which will help the liver process fats more efficiently. A 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5954622/#s12" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that regular physical activity has a beneficial effect on NAFLD. Various regimens of aerobic and resistance training have been shown to reduce hepatic fat content through improvements in insulin resistance, liver fatty acid metabolism, liver mitochondrial function, and activation of inflammatory cascades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add protein and fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Protein curbs hunger, and thereby prevents overeating, which blocks fat accumulation. The fiber, on the other hand, supports gut health and reduces fat absorption. Try to incorporate foods like eggs, fish, chicken, broccoli, oats, flaxseeds, and chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid refined carbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you may be fond of all those chips, breads, and pastries. But if you want to reverse fatty liver, the best bet would be to cut out refined carbs from your diet. Replace them with whole grains such as quinoa and brown rice, starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes, and healthy fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fans Concerned as Karan Johar Looks Noticeably Thin in Latest Picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lose weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overweight and obesity can contribute to fatty liver. Losing just 5–10% of body weight can significantly reduce liver fat. Try to aim for a gradual weight loss through diet and exercise. This way, the weight loss will be sustainable and effective.

One hundred years ago, and for thousands of years before that, eggs were considered essential. Nutrient-dense and rich in protein and micronutrients, eggs were a staple throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a few decades ago, scientists found that high levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1764970/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol in the blood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol in the blood&lt;/a&gt; were a risk factor for heart disease, so high-cholesterol eggs were pushed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4632449/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to the naughty corner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to the naughty corner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, as nutrition science progressed, it became clear that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/102/2/276/4564504" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; did not significantly impact blood levels of cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this new understanding, and a healthy dose of research funding from the Egg Nutrition Center, eggs were edged slowly back into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their saturated fat content, though, is still a concern, so eggs are still partially sidelined. Still, they are likely much healthier than many of the low-fat, highly processed snacks that have replaced eggs in modern kitchens. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6470839/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eggs contain all essential trace elements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eggs contain all essential trace elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most nutritionists and associated experts have a relatively neutral view of eggs. In general, the advice is that they can form a part of a healthy, well-balanced diet, but at the same time, eating multiple eggs per day could be unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs and Alzheimer’s: What is the link?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, and despite decades of research, there is no cure, and treatments that can slow the disease are severely lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, understanding the lifestyle factors associated with increased risk is essential. In this vein, many scientists are focusing on dietary influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous research has shown that choline is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:important for cognitive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;important for cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. It has also identified a potential link between moderate choline intake and a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524008694" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced risk of dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. As the authors of the latest study explain, eggs are the “top food source” of choline, so they are worth investigating. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline has many important functions; for instance, it is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, plays a pivotal role in cell membranes, and has &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/8/815" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuroprotective powers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuroprotective powers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as the authors explain, “choline modulates the expression of key genes related to memory, learning, and cognitive functions via epigenetic mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although our body can synthesise choline, it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2782876/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cannot synthesize enough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cannot synthesize enough&lt;/a&gt; to meet all the body’s needs, so some must be taken in with our diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from choline, eggs contain essential &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which support &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/8/1094" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health as we age;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain health as we age&lt;/a&gt;. Worryingly, studies show that the majority of adults in the United States &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/5/e043301?uid=42bf899700" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:do not consume enough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;do not consume enough&lt;/a&gt; of these essential fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These facts led the authors of the new study to investigate links between egg consumption and Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduced risk and less protein buildup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent study included data from 1,024 older adults with an average age of 81.4. All participants lived in retirement communities and residential facilities in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They attended yearly checkups and completed food frequency questionnaires, and the researchers followed them for an average of 6.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, a little over one-quarter of them developed Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After analysis, the scientists found that individuals who consumed at least one egg per week had a 47% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s during follow-up compared with those eating one egg per month or fewer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of their study, they looked at the post-mortem brains of 578 participants. They found that those who ate one or more eggs each week were more likely to have less Alzheimer’s-associated protein buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choline and omega-3 synergy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors suggest that consuming at least one egg per week may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. They explain that the choline and omega-3s in eggs might have a “synergistic” effect, whereby they join forces to protect brain health during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/researcher/christopher-u-missling-phd-mba" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher U. Missling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher U. Missling&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, president and CEO of Anavex Life Sciences, who was not involved in the study. Missling explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 39–40% of the protective effect was explained by higher dietary choline intake. Egg yolks also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have known neuroprotective properties. The combination of choline and omega-3s may be particularly beneficial for brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors also point to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40120-020-00227-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating that people with Alzheimer’s are more likely to be deficient in omega-3s and choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists conclude that, “once replicated in other prospective cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials, these findings may have important public health implications for reducing the population’s risk of [Alzheimer’s].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the results are replicated, this could be a very useful, low-cost intervention. &lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;also spokle with Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was likewise not involved in the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs are often a go-to food for older adults, as they’re soft in texture, which can be helpful for those with dentures, quick to prepare, and packed with key nutrients,” Gallivan explained. “So it’s great to see a study focussing on how they may support cognitive health in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study does have certain limitations. For instance, they only had a relatively short follow-up — just 6.7 years. This, as the authors explain, increases the risk of reverse causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study population consisted of older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a specific U.S.-based cohort,” Missling told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. “The findings may not generalize to younger populations or those from different cultural or dietary backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reminded us that “dietary intake was assessed through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias and inaccuracies.” So, participants may not have accurately reported or remembered their egg consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s important to remember that no single food acts in isolation,” Gallivan told us, “and it’s our overall dietary pattern that really counts. A varied, nutrient-dense diet rich in whole foods is key to supporting brain health and reducing dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, if you like eggs, enjoy them. They may reduce your dementia risk, but if not, they will certainly provide you with a good dose of protein and a healthy range of micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eating-1-egg-per-week-linked-to-lower-alzheimers-risk-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 06:05:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1ZTGdnZW50Wkx0WjljLTM5QkNsajlDcGtvY3FDTjh4bTY5dmd1d0FIS2gtbGQzOXRhOER6ZXVyQUN1VmFLTXA4RU55S2tuVFFnb3I0eG9SWUx2LVk4M0pBNVg1bEFIZWM</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症：吃鸡蛋与减少有毒蛋白质的积累有关-今日医学新闻 | Alzheimer's: Eating eggs linked to less buildup of toxic proteins - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNa293dnpTeVBfNXc4UkFiNWpWR21hbWJIVHJkS1RRVzd5OGM2d01Pa3c0d29RTHdscjRlWnJDV2R3RTNUSXZTSnFFc3prQVNra2NLMmtLVjh3ODA2RllQMjFPZDZjVGxNZjN1MUZBSTg2TFpSQ0VvbW40cVY3UmdiNFRuTDNmVWQ1QUdDOExLRHB1cFVHekVTUkFhc1pNWE0tZUxfREJWdVM1am8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/egg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/egg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/egg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/egg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="eggs with different shell colors" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Feating-1-egg-per-week-linked-to-lower-alzheimers-risk-study-finds&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F07%2Fegg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Alzheimer's%3A%20Eating%20eggs%20linked%20to%20less%20buildup%20of%20toxic%20proteins" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/egg-Alzheimers-Stocksy_txp9f6bd02bvV9400_Medium_6755625-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Eating eggs regularly is linked to less buildup of toxic proteins in brain, according to a study on human brains.

All participants lived in retirement communities and residential facilities in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They attended yearly checkups and completed food frequency questionnaires, and the researchers followed them for an average of 6.7 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, a little over one-quarter of them developed Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After analysis, the scientists found that individuals who consumed at least one egg per week had a 47% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s during follow-up compared with those eating one egg per month or fewer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of their study, they looked at the post-mortem brains of 578 participants. They found that those who ate one or more eggs each week were more likely to have less Alzheimer’s-associated protein buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors suggest that consuming at least one egg per week may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. They explain that the choline and omega-3s in eggs might have a “synergistic” effect, whereby they join forces to protect brain health during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/researcher/christopher-u-missling-phd-mba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Christopher U. Missling&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, president and CEO of Anavex Life Sciences, who was not involved in the study. Missling explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 39–40% of the protective effect was explained by higher dietary choline intake. Egg yolks also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have known neuroprotective properties. The combination of choline and omega-3s may be particularly beneficial for brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors also point to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40120-020-00227-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating that people with Alzheimer’s are more likely to be deficient in omega-3s and choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists conclude that, “once replicated in other prospective cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials, these findings may have important public health implications for reducing the population’s risk of [Alzheimer’s].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the results are replicated, this could be a very useful, low-cost intervention. &lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;also spokle with Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was likewise not involved in the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs are often a go-to food for older adults, as they’re soft in texture, which can be helpful for those with dentures, quick to prepare, and packed with key nutrients,” Gallivan explained. “So it’s great to see a study focussing on how they may support cognitive health in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study does have certain limitations. For instance, they only had a relatively short follow-up — just 6.7 years. This, as the authors explain, increases the risk of reverse causality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study population consisted of older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a specific U.S.-based cohort,” Missling told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. “The findings may not generalize to younger populations or those from different cultural or dietary backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reminded us that “dietary intake was assessed through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias and inaccuracies.” So, participants may not have accurately reported or remembered their egg consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s important to remember that no single food acts in isolation,” Gallivan told us, “and it’s our overall dietary pattern that really counts. A varied, nutrient-dense diet rich in whole foods is key to supporting brain health and reducing dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, if you like eggs, enjoy them. They may reduce your dementia risk, but if not, they will certainly provide you with a good dose of protein and a healthy range of micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 05:34:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNa293dnpTeVBfNXc4UkFiNWpWR21hbWJIVHJkS1RRVzd5OGM2d01Pa3c0d29RTHdscjRlWnJDV2R3RTNUSXZTSnFFc3prQVNra2NLMmtLVjh3ODA2RllQMjFPZDZjVGxNZjN1MUZBSTg2TFpSQ0VvbW40cVY3UmdiNFRuTDNmVWQ1QUdDOExLRHB1cFVHekVTUkFhc1pNWE0tZUxfREJWdVM1am8</guid></item><item><title>加拿大艾伯塔省正在使麻疹再次变得伟大- Daily Kos | Alberta, Canada is making measles great again - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPSFk5eEZjRmc5M2JEdk9yQzNfWHlyaFRoblUtczAxVW1zS0ZZYy1xUGh3QkhYNHBvUTQ2N2Z5MDJnU09tNTFidVFpTURid29rUjhuSE1GMTVocU5LUW9qSXc1U0tnbGdON0RlekpxUmllUm9IMTY2N2tsdG44TC1GOUFNNnJIR0hSTC1OUlJvTVE5R1ZiT2VnaVpFZXQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/alberta-surpasses-1400-measles-cases-with-31-new-infections/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;CTV News reports that things are not looking good in Alberta, Canada.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberta added 31 new measles cases on Friday to reach a total of 1,407 infections since March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the cases, 18, were detected in the north zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six cases were found in Calgary, five in the south zone, one in central Alberta, and one in Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/alberta-surpasses-us-in-confirmed-measles-cases-with-more-than-1300/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Alberta surpassed the United States in confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean Blundell has more, much of it scathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://deanblundell.substack.com/p/freedom-sores-and-faith-based-failure" target="_blank" title=""&gt;“Freedom Sores” and Faith-Based Failure: How Alberta Became the Measles Capital of the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religious extremism, political cowardice, and anti-vax hillbillies have made Alberta ground zero for a third-world disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian province of Alberta has officially surpassed the United States in the number of confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let that sink in. Alberta — with just 4.6 million people — now leads North America in a disease we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;eliminated in the 1990s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The province has racked up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,407 active measles cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, compared to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,309 for the entire U.S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the reason? Simple. Alberta is infected — not just with measles, but with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a political virus and a religious death cult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; that’s been festering in the UCP’s base for years. Welcome to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freedom Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, where anti-vax evangelicals and cowardly conservative politicians have turned “personal choice” into a province-wide outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t a public health failure. It’s a public health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;execution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; — and the weapon is willful stupidity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/deanblundell/p/freedom-sores-and-faith-based-failure?r=4bv4c&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false" target="_blank"&gt;Blundell has more at the link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;, tracing the outbreak to convictions held by the Anabaptist communities -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;specifically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mennonites and Hutterites. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve been aided and abetted in this by the United Conservative Party, which dominates the province politically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a walk through their cowardice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No school vaccine mandates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Unlike other provinces, Alberta does &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; require children to be vaccinated to attend school. It’s a "parental rights" thing, apparently — which is political code for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;don’t piss off the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No public health emergency declaration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Despite more cases than the entire U.S., the UCP government refused to call it an emergency. Why? Because that would mean admitting that “freedom” failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; No province-wide immunization blitz. No penalties for spreading misinformation. No real leadership.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberta is Canada’s oil patch, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabasca_oil_sands" target="_blank" title=""&gt;with big deposits of oil sands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Alberta is also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_separatism" target="_blank" title=""&gt;threatening to secede from Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; under UCP leadership. Many of the same themes running through the MAGA movement in the U.S. resonate there, along with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aupress.ca/books/120251-alberta-oil-and-the-decline-of-democracy-in-canada/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;the baleful influence of the petroleum industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, conservative beliefs and petro-politics should be considered health hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

A new review from Harvard-affiliated &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; pinpoints 17 modifiable factors that turn up again and again in stroke, dementia, and late-life depression. Tackle even one, and you trim risk for all three; tackle several, and benefits compound significantly over time for long-term cognitive health. The researchers wrapped everything into a 21-point Brain Care Score so clinicians and patients can track progress just as they would blood pressure or cholesterol. Their bottom line: genes set the stage, but daily habits, environment, and treatable medical issues ultimately decide the plot.

Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia. This surge is closely tied to modern lifestyles, rising obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic disorders, making NAFLD a condition that reflects broader changes in diet, physical activity, and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-4-in-florida-what-is-it-and-how-to-stay-safe/photostory/122562539.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;condition &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH). NAFLD is becoming increasingly common, and is often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often termed the "silent epidemic," NAFLD is often symptomless in its early stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? You don’t always need a prescription and pills to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature has packed powerful allies into tiny packages: nuts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why choose nuts for fatty liver? As per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7693493/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, nut consumption improves cardiometabolic risk factors, like, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia – all closely linked to fatty liver.

They are a popular type of tree nut, known for their wrinkled, brain-like appearance and rich, sweet taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why pick them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Packed with omega‑3 fatty acids and antioxidants, walnuts are often hailed as the top nut for liver support. Their anti-inflammatory properties help reduce liver fat and improve enzyme levels. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515100/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2021 Mediterranean-diet study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that daily walnut consumption led to significantly greater liver fat reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the morning, walnuts provide steady energy and blood sugar stability. Whereas, at night, their melatonin and magnesium content can boost sleep and control overnight inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Almonds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds are the edible seeds of the Prunus dulcis tree, commonly known as the almond tree. They are technically drupes, which are fruits with a fleshy outer layer (the hull and shell in this case) and a hard shell surrounding the seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why pick them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; High in vitamin E, fiber, and monounsaturated fats, almonds support fat metabolism in the liver and reduce oxidative stress. Regular almond intake has been linked to lower LDL cholesterol and improved blood sugar levels, both important for fatty liver prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almonds are usually and popularly consumed in the morning, before or with breakfast. Early in the day helps curb cravings, enhance digestion, and stabilize sugar levels. A mid‑afternoon handful can prevent unhealthy snacking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pistachios&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistachios are the edible seeds of the pistachio tree, Pistacia vera, known for their distinct green color and slightly sweet, nutty flavor. They are typically encased in a hard, beige shell that needs to be cracked open to reveal the seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why pick them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loaded with antioxidants and beneficial fats, pistachios modulate genes tied to lipid metabolism and reduce oxidative damage. Studies suggest they support healthy lipid profiles and guard the liver against fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a pre- or post-workout snack, pistachios offer quick energy and recovery nutrition. Pair them with milk or a banana before bed to tap into their magnesium and promote relaxation. However, do not eat in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pecans&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans are a type of tree nut native to North America, specifically the southern and central regions of the United States and Mexico. They are known for their rich, buttery flavor and crisp texture, making them a popular ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why pick them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pecans are rich in monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, and antioxidants, nutrients that combat inflammation and protect liver cells. Incorporating them into a Mediterranean-style eating pattern helps reduce liver fat and improves metabolic markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swap them in as crunchy salad toppers at lunch, or enjoy a small portion mid-morning to satisfy hunger and support a healthy lipid profile. You can pair them with fruits for a delectable dessert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brazil nuts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil nuts are large, oblong seeds from the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), native to the Amazon rainforest. They are known for being a rich source of selenium, a trace mineral essential for various bodily functions. Beyond selenium, they also offer a good source of healthy fats, protein, fiber, and other vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why pick them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exceptionally rich in selenium, an antioxidant that boosts selenoproteins crucial for liver detox and oxidative stress defense. Just 1–3 Brazil nuts daily can meet your selenium needs without going overboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy them in the morning or early afternoon to ensure selenium is absorbed gradually throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safety note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selenium toxicity is possible with excessive intake. Stick to 1–3 nuts per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

One of the most common conditions is non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Once primarily associated with older individuals, NAFLD, however, is increasingly affecting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8485885/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, due to many modern lifestyle factors such as poor diet, sedentary habits, and obesity. If left untreated, fatty liver disease can progress to more serious conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. Over time, it may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, fatty liver can be reversed, along with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Here are five evidence-based strategies to reverse NAFLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stick to a &lt;keyword id="20264834" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Mediterranean-diet" source="keywords"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat has a significant impact on your overall health. The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish, is considered one of the best diets for overall health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/s0168-8278(17)32052-4/fulltext#s0025" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have consistently shown that following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. This diet helps to reduce liver fat and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet is rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant foods, and also does not have any refined carbs and processed sugars, both known to worsen liver health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incorporate physical activity&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise is a powerful tool to manage NAFLD. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly, such as brisk walking or cycling. Also, add strength training. A 2017 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/s0168-8278(17)32052-4/fulltext#s0045" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has linked NAFLD to a sedentary lifestyle. It is important to understand that our body is programmed to move. Physical activity plays an important role in the management of NAFLD and NASH. Regular exercise reduces liver fat by improving insulin sensitivity. Even small changes, like taking stairs or walking during breaks, can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that a Mediterranean diet can help reverse fatty liver disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lose excess weight&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is one of the most effective ways to reverse fatty liver disease. Even losing 5-10% of body weight can significantly reduce liver fat. It is important to understand that gradual and sustainable weight loss through diet and exercise is key. Rapid weight loss can worsen liver damage. Talk to your healthcare provider or nutritionist to create a sustainable plan tailored to your needs. Keep track of your progress with measurable goals, like waist circumference or BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="23463913" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cut-sugar" source="keywords"&gt;Cut sugar&lt;/keyword&gt; and refined carbs&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to improve your liver health is to limit foods high in added sugars, such as soft drinks, pastries, and white bread. Excess sugar, particularly fructose, is directly linked to fat accumulation in the liver. Also, avoid any refined carbs, and instead eat whole foods and ones that have a low glycemic index, such as oats, legumes, brown rice, and vegetables, to stabilize blood sugar levels. A 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10629746/#sec18" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has emphasized the importance of reducing sugar intake. It is also linked to metabolic conditions of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drink coffee &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have consistently shown that drinking coffee, especially black coffee without sugar or cream, may protect the liver. Coffee is rich in antioxidants like chlorogenic acid, which can help reduce oxidative stress in the liver. It has been associated with lower levels of liver enzymes, reduced liver inflammation, and a decreased risk of liver fibrosis in people with NAFLD. A 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10991-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that drinking cups of coffee every day can reduce the risk of fatty liver by 20% and death from chronic liver disease by 49%. However, if you have other health conditions like acid reflux or anxiety, it is important to consult a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 02:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxPdkJoQ25pNjdYeFRXTHVUT29EWmJGWHMzSHpNbzUwLU1DZFR2VGJHU21kVGhiN1h0TUVzdmw4WXc3d0xGcGlPZ2xYWG9sRFFqNms4Y240NHVoZ2RkRXB5d2hZNkFTLXA1ajJRTjBueXpJeTZZQm1aNVBTTWZITHU1NmJGTVQ2QkdOODZCZC1BWXZza3lWZUpRWlA1N2FUSDJhTzdOemNjM3NBWjJKZGtUV0JlX0o1M0ZsUjA3QWtnSFlNS3prN1lseVBIbjA1WURpMUlxQ2ZEOFVRNUhZXzhEZTk1dHBtS1ZiUUc2VA</guid></item><item><title>也许这不仅仅是衰老。可能是贫血。- Noozhawk | Maybe It’s Not Just Aging.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Sergott felt weary all the time. “I’d get tired, short of breath, a sort of malaise,” he said. He was cold even on warm days and looked pale with dark circles under his eyes.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His malady was not mysterious. As a retired nurse anesthetist, Sergott knew he had anemia, a deficiency of red blood cells. In his case, it was the consequence of a hereditary condition that caused almost daily nosebleeds and depleted his hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen throughout the body.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in consulting doctors about his fatigue, he found that many didn’t know how to help. They advised Sergott, who lives in Westminster, Maryland, to take iron tablets, usually the first-line treatment for anemia.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_816049329"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_816049329" zone-id="67458" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,local_news,health,maybe-its-not-just-aging-maybe-its-anemia,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But like many older people, he found a daily regimen of four to six tablets hard to tolerate. Some patients taking iron complain of severe constipation or stomach cramps. Sergott felt “nauseated all the time.” And iron tablets don’t always work.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After almost 15 years, he found a solution. Michael Auerbach, a hematologist and an oncologist who is the co-director of the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders in Baltimore, suggested that Sergott receive iron intravenously instead of orally.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Sergott, 78, gets an hourlong infusion when his hemoglobin levels and other markers show that he needs one, usually three times a year. “It’s like filling the gas tank,” he said. His symptoms recede, and “I feel great.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story reflects, however, the frequent dismissal of a common condition, one that can not only diminish older adults’ quality of life but also lead to serious health consequences, including falls, fractures, and hospital stays.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anemia’s symptoms — tiredness, headaches, leg cramps, coldness, decreased ability to exercise, brain fog — are often attributed to aging itself, William Ershler, a hematologist and researcher said. (Some people with anemia remain asymptomatic.)



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People say, ‘I feel weak, but everybody my age feels weak,’” Ershler said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though hemoglobin levels are likely to have been included in their patients’ records, as part of the complete blood count, or CBC, routinely ordered during medical visits, doctors often fail to recognize anemia.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The patients come to the clinic and get the blood tests, and nothing happens,” he said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anemia affects 12.5% of people over 60, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db519.htm"&gt;most recent survey data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the rate rises thereafter.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may be an underestimate.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Ershler and his colleagues examined the electronic health records of almost 2,000 outpatients over 65 at Inova, the large health system based in Northern Virginia from which he recently retired.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on blood test results, the prevalence of anemia was much higher: About &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40476342/"&gt;1 in 5 patients was anemic&lt;/a&gt;, with hemoglobin levels below normal as defined by the World Health Organization.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet only about a third of those patients had anemia properly documented in their medical charts.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anemia “deserves our attention, but it doesn’t always get it,” said George Kuchel, a geriatrician at the University of Connecticut, who wasn’t surprised by the findings.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s partly because anemia has so many causes, some more treatable than others. In perhaps a third of cases, it arises from a nutritional deficiency — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40159291/"&gt;usually a lack of iron&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes of vitamin B12 or folate (called folic acid in synthetic form).



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older people may have decreased appetites or struggle to shop for food and prepare meals. But anemia can also follow blood loss from ulcers, polyps, diabetes, and other causes of internal bleeding.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery can also lead to iron deficiency. Mary Dagold, 83, a retired librarian in Pikesville, Maryland, underwent three abdominal operations in 2019. She remained bedridden for weeks afterward and needed a feeding tube for months. Even after she healed, “the anemia didn’t go away,” she said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembers feeling perpetually exhausted. “And I knew I wasn’t thinking the way I usually think,” she added. “I couldn’t read a novel.” Her primary care doctor and Auerbach both advised that oral iron was unlikely to help.




&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron tablets, available over the counter, are inexpensive. Intravenous iron, becoming more widely prescribed, can cost $350 to $2,400 per infusion depending on the formulation, Auerbach said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients find a single dose sufficient, while others will need regular treatment. Medicare covers it when tablets are hard to tolerate or ineffective.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Dagold, a 25-minute intravenous iron infusion every five weeks or so has made a startling difference. “It takes a few days, and then you feel well enough to go about your daily life,” she said. She has returned to her water aerobics class four days a week.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, anemia arises from chronic conditions like heart disease, kidney failure, bone marrow disorders, or inflammatory bowel diseases.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These people don’t lack iron, but they’re not able to process it to make red blood cells,” Kuchel said. Since iron supplements won’t be effective, doctors try to address the anemia by treating patients’ underlying illnesses.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to pay attention: “Loss of iron can be the first harbinger of colon cancer and stomach cancer,” Kuchel pointed out.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In about a third of patients, however, anemia remains &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17565"&gt;frustratingly unexplained&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve done everything, and we have no idea what’s causing it,” he said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning more about anemia’s causes and treatments might prevent a lot of misery down the road. Besides its association with falls and fractures, anemia “can increase the severity of chronic illnesses — heart, lung, kidney, liver,” Auerbach said. “If it’s really severe and hemoglobin goes to life-threatening levels, it can cause a heart attack or stroke.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the unknowns, however, is whether treating anemia early and restoring normal hemoglobin will prevent later illnesses. Still, “things are happening in this field,” Ershler said, pointing to a National Institute on Aging &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/workshops/explaining-unexplained-anemia-older-adults-pathophysiology-clinical#:~:text=This%2520workshop%2520will%2520identify%2520the,to%2520clinical%2520trials%2520and%2520implementation."&gt;workshop on unexplained anemia&lt;/a&gt; held last year.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Hematology has appointed a committee on &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/clinicians/guidelines-and-quality-care/clinical-practice-guidelines/iron-deficiency-anemia"&gt;diagnosing and treating iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt; and plans to publish new guidelines next year. The Iron Consortium at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University convened an international panel on managing iron deficiency and recently &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(25)00038-9/abstract"&gt;published its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Haematology.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, many older patients can gain access to their CBC results and thus their hemoglobin levels. The &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/85839/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.1_eng.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization defines&lt;/a&gt; 13 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter as normal for men, and 12 for nonpregnant women (though some hematologists argue that those thresholds are too low).



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking health care providers about hemoglobin and iron levels, or using a patient portal to check the numbers themselves, could help patients steer conversations with their doctors away from fatigue or other symptoms as inevitable results of aging.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they’re signs of anemia, and perhaps it’s treatable.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chances are, you’ve had a CBC in the last six months or a year,” Kuchel said. “If your hemoglobin is fine, great.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he added, “If it’s really outside the normal boundaries, or it’s changed compared to a year ago, you need to ask questions.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking tart cherry juice can gently boost melatonin levels, which may help improve sleep onset and overall sleep quality without the grogginess often associated with certain sleep medications and supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy an iced mocktail.&lt;/strong&gt; Pour tart cherry juice over ice and top with sparkling water and a splash of citrus for a sleepy mocktail. Add a scoop of magnesium glycinate powder—another nutrient known to help with sleep—to increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep-enhancing benefits&lt;/a&gt; of the tart cherry juice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have it with a light snack.&lt;/strong&gt; “Drinking tart cherry juice alongside a small snack—like whole-grain toast with almond butter—may help support tryptophan absorption and promote relaxation,” DeVito tells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink it 1-2 hours before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; DeVito says this timing will help limit middle-of-the-night bathroom trips. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce end-of-day stress. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s hard to fall asleep when your mind is racing, so Salinas recommends incorporating relaxation techniques like breathing exercises, meditation, yoga or some light stretches to help manage stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. A regular sleep-wake rhythm helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regulate your body’s internal clock&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up feeling rested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit screen time before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; Blue light can disrupt the production of melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep. “I usually encourage shutting off screens at least 30-60 minutes before sleeping,” says Salinas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get active during the day.&lt;/strong&gt; Research suggests that consistent, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;moderate-intensity exercise&lt;/a&gt; can help you fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality.6 Aim to avoid high-intensity workouts close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid caffeine later in the day. &lt;/strong&gt;Drink your last caffeinated beverage at least 4–6 hours before going to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking tart cherry juice before bed may help you fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality thanks to its melatonin, tryptophan and antioxidant content, but it’s not a band-aid. If you’re having difficulty sleeping, take a moment to assess your habits. A consistent sleep schedule, along with a nighttime routine, can help signal to your body that it’s time for sleep. For deep sleep, consider adding more movement to your day, limiting afternoon caffeine intake and turning off devices an hour before lights out. With these daily habits—and a glass of tart cherry juice—you’ll be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/expert-recommended-sleep-products-2024-8711570" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;catching more quality zzzs&lt;/a&gt; in no time.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental awareness grows daily as we discover the impact of our everyday choices. One household item now under scrutiny is toilet paper – a product many consider essential but which creates significant ecological problems. The future is bringing sustainable alternatives that promise to revolutionize personal hygiene while protecting our planet. This shift represents one of many &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/examples-of-natural-and-artificial-changes-in-ecosystems/"&gt;examples of artificial changes in ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; driven by human innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The environmental cost of toilet paper&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toilet paper production consumes vast natural resources at an alarming rate. Each roll requires trees, water, and energy, contributing to deforestation and habitat destruction worldwide. The manufacturing process releases chemicals that become &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/what-are-pollutant-agents/"&gt;pollutant agents&lt;/a&gt; affecting air and water quality.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Beyond production impacts, toilet paper disposal creates additional environmental burdens. When flushed, it travels through sewage systems where it can cause blockages and require energy-intensive treatment. Even “flushable” varieties don’t break down as quickly as marketed, contributing to infrastructure problems and eventually becoming &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/natural-water-pollutants/"&gt;natural water pollutants&lt;/a&gt; in our waterways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statistics paint a concerning picture:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Resource&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Amount Used Per Year&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trees&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Habitat loss, reduced carbon capture&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;473 billion gallons&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Water scarcity, ecosystem disruption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Energy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17.3 terawatts&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carbon emissions, climate change&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show that &lt;strong&gt;traditional toilet paper manufacturing contributes significantly to water contamination&lt;/strong&gt;. The bleaching process introduces chlorine compounds that, when released into waterways, create persistent toxins. Understanding &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/how-water-is-contaminated/"&gt;how water is contaminated&lt;/a&gt; through our everyday choices helps us make better decisions for environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Health concerns with traditional toilet paper&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond environmental impacts, toilet paper presents several health challenges. The rough texture can cause irritation, especially with repeated use. For those with sensitive skin or existing conditions like hemorrhoids, the abrasive nature of toilet paper can exacerbate discomfort and potentially lead to infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals increasingly recognize that &lt;strong&gt;water cleaning provides superior hygiene compared to dry wiping&lt;/strong&gt;. Paper simply spreads residue rather than removing it completely, particularly with non-solid waste. This incomplete cleaning can lead to bacteria transfer and potential urinary tract infections, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chemical additives in toilet paper create additional health concerns:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragrances and dyes that cause skin reactions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Bleaching agents with potential links to respiratory issues&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives with irritant properties&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microplastics from recycled paper sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These chemicals not only affect users directly but eventually enter our environment. This exemplifies &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/how-consumerism-affects-the-environment/"&gt;how consumerism affects the environment&lt;/a&gt; through seemingly innocent daily choices. The cumulative impact of these personal products extends far beyond our bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The bidet revolution: water-based alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japan leads the global shift away from toilet paper with sophisticated toilet systems that use water jets for cleaning. These high-tech fixtures represent the future of bathroom hygiene, offering customizable water pressure, temperature control, and even air drying functions. The transition eliminates the need for paper products entirely while providing superior cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advantages of water-based cleaning systems extend beyond environmental benefits. Users report &lt;em&gt;improved personal hygiene, reduced irritation, and greater comfort&lt;/em&gt; compared to traditional paper methods. For those with mobility issues or certain medical conditions, these systems offer independence and dignity that paper alternatives cannot match.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simple bidet attachments have made this technology accessible without requiring complete bathroom renovations. These affordable devices connect to existing toilets and provide the essential water-cleaning function without the expense of high-end models. Installation typically takes less than an hour and requires minimal tools or plumbing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teaching younger generations about these alternatives represents an investment in future environmental protection. &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/ecological-games-for-children/"&gt;Ecological games for children&lt;/a&gt; can help introduce these concepts in engaging ways, creating awareness that will shape their consumption patterns throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Transitioning to sustainable bathroom practices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those hesitant to install bidets, transitional approaches offer stepping stones toward paper-free bathrooms. &lt;strong&gt;Bamboo-based toilet paper provides a more sustainable alternative&lt;/strong&gt; to traditional wood-pulp products. Bamboo grows rapidly with minimal water and no pesticides, making it an excellent renewable resource with a substantially lower environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reusable cloth options present another path for the environmentally conscious. Specially designed cloths for personal cleaning can be washed and reused, eliminating waste entirely. While this option requires commitment to proper sanitization, it aligns perfectly with &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/environmental-values-what-are-and-examples/"&gt;environmental values&lt;/a&gt; that prioritize sustainability over convenience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The financial benefits of abandoning toilet paper are substantial over time:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial bidet investment: $30-$300 depending on features&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Average toilet paper spending per person: $120 annually&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Water cost increase: approximately $2-5 annually&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Return on investment: typically 6-18 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creative reuse represents another aspect of sustainable living. Just as we can find new purposes for common household items, like &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/how-to-make-candles-with-used-oil/"&gt;making candles with used oil&lt;/a&gt;, we can reimagine our bathroom practices to eliminate waste and reduce consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shift away from toilet paper symbolizes a broader movement toward thoughtful consumption and environmental stewardship. By questioning even our most ingrained habits, we discover opportunities to align our daily practices with our values for planetary health and human wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
