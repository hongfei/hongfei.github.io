			&lt;p&gt;Brain damage caused by blocked blood vessels may be treatable using injections of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="174948" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study by researchers from the University of Zurich and the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results could one day help patients who have experienced some forms of stroke recover lost functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice with stroke-induced brain damage, the researchers found that injections of human stem cells could successfully develop into immature brain cells. &lt;span&gt;The results were dramatic: most of the implanted cells remained in place, developing features of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mystery-of-how-neurons-control-the-brain-has-finally-been-solved"&gt;fully functioning neurons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;communicating with surrounding cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sweetener-could-damage-critical-brain-barrier-risking-stroke"&gt;Common Sweetener Could Damage Critical Brain Barrier, Risking Stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We found that the stem cells survived for the full analysis period of five weeks and that most of them transformed into neurons, which actually even communicated with the already existing brain cells," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/media/2025/stroke.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; neuroscientist Christian Tackenberg, from the University of Zurich.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers observed blood vessels self-repairing, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/every-new-memory-you-make-causes-damage-to-your-brain-cells"&gt;inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt; reducing, and the blood-brain barrier growing stronger. The mice even showed signs of improved movement and coordination – a key finding, as strokes can seriously impair the body's motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174951" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain.jpg" alt="Mouse brain cross section." class="wp-image-174951 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Image of a mouse brain showing the stroke area (dashed circle) and the projections of the transplanted human stem cells (dark brown). (UZH)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study builds on &lt;a href="http://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202504154"&gt;earlier work&lt;/a&gt; carried out by some of the same researchers, which looked at the optimal timing for injecting stem cells following a stroke. This is going to be important in developing actual treatments: it seems the brain needs to have stabilized to a certain extent after the stroke for the transplant to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4061516"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have covered some of the same ground, Tackenberg and team say none have gone into the same level of detail as this latest one. The researchers weren't just interested in the survival of implanted cells, but also in whether they might form neurological connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis goes far beyond the scope of other studies, which focused on the immediate effects right after transplantation," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/media/2025/stroke.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tackenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the damage that a stroke does to the brain is irreversible, and it's something that affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930241308142"&gt;a quarter of the population&lt;/a&gt;. The internal bleeding or oxygen restriction caused by a stroke permanently destroys brain cells, which can significantly affect speech and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that, given time,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="174948" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; therapy could be used to repair what is currently irreparable. We're already seeing multiple innovations in this area, including treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cells-reverse-type-1-diabetes-in-clinical-trial"&gt;for diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cell-transplant-restores-vision-in-multiple-people"&gt;vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this approach could work in human brains remains to be seen, and would need to be tested over a much longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of challenges ahead: any interference in the brain has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-consciousness-detected-in-25-of-unresponsive-patients-tested"&gt;go wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers need to find a way to prevent the implanted stem cells from going beyond their original remit, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is essential to pursue new therapeutic approaches to potential brain regeneration after diseases or accidents," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/media/2025/stroke.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tackenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that neural stem cells not only form new neurons, but also induce other regeneration processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63725-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Health blogs, wellness coaches, and even social media influencers call it a “miracle mineral” that can calm anxiety, improve sleep, ease muscle cramps, support heart health, and boost energy. With such loud claims, many people rush to add magnesium capsules, powders, or gummies into their daily routine. However, they meet a drastic sense of disappointment right after! Why? Not because the supplements aren’t working. It’s because, despite weeks of consistent use, there seems to be little or no noticeable effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puzzling experience leaves users asking an inevitable question: why doesn’t magnesium work, even when taken daily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the truth is that magnesium plays a crucial role in over 300 biochemical processes in the body. But unlike the loud claims, its impact is often subtle, gradual, and highly dependent on other supporting yet crucial factors like diet, absorption, dosage, and underlying health conditions. Unlike stimulants such as caffeine or fast-acting painkillers, magnesium rarely produces an instant “kick.” Instead, its benefits tend to build slowly over time, sometimes so quietly that they go unnoticed unless carefully observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a detailed look at why magnesium supplements might not produce visible effects for many people, and what science says about making supplementation actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 01:57:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>女婴的父母说，当他们发出绝望的请求时，世界已经“分崩离析” -镜报</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-baby-girl-say-world-35941313</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_420b4d" publication="mirror"&gt;Parents of baby girl say world has been 'blown apart' as they issue desperate plea&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_b38f47" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Six-month-old Rory has been in hospital since she was born due to a condition that causes the left ventricle of her heart to be stretched and enlarged - her parents are desperate for a donor and refuse to lose hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35941312"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Rory Fletcher has been hospitalised since her birth due to dilated cardiomyopathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;The desperate &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt;

No wonder so many people feel confused about how to actually get healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition executive who is attempting to bring real science back into the conversation. His mission? To debunk the myths keeping people stuck — and replace them with evidence-based solutions that make lasting health and weight loss possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #1: My metabolism is slowing down with age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Your metabolism doesn't automatically slow down just because you're getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metabolic rate is tied to body weight, not age," Bikman says. "When people gain weight, their metabolism actually rises. When they lose weight, metabolism falls. The problem isn't age — it's how we're treating our metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real danger is following extreme diets and punishing exercise plans that leave your metabolism broken. TV shows that glorify starvation-style weight loss might deliver dramatic short-term results, but long-term, they wreck your body's natural balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is you can fix your metabolism by eating smarter — balancing proteins, healthy fats, and carbs the right way," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: freebird7977/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #2: Exercise can erase a bad diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard it: "Don't worry, you can just work it off at the gym." But that's a dangerous half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is essential. It's great for your heart, brain, hormones and aging well. But as Bikman puts it: "You can't outrun a bad diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A truly tough workout might burn a few hundred calories. That's less than a slice of pizza. And the wrong foods — especially refined carbs and seed oils — don't just resist being burned, they actively trigger fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to rev up your metabolism, your diet is the lever that matters most. "Your diet likely got you where you are," Bikman says. "But it can also change to get you to where you want to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #3: All calories are the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, in a chemistry lab, a calorie is a calorie. But in your body, the type of calorie changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would anyone seriously argue that 2,000 calories of soda are equal to 2,000 calories of real, nutrient-dense foods?" Bikman asks. "One drives obesity and disease, the other helps you to thrive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plain truth is, calories interact with your hormones. Insulin, for example, dictates whether you burn calories, store them as fat or waste them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limit carbs, fuel with protein and healthy fats, and you'll enjoy steady energy, sharpen your brain, strengthen your immune system, and actually accelerate your metabolism," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #4: Low-fat diets are the healthiest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth dates back to 1977, when U.S. government guidelines told Americans to cut fat and eat far more carbohydrates — without legitimate scientific backing. The result? People swapped healthy fats for refined carbs and the outcome has been catastrophic. The average adult is now nearly 30 pounds heavier than average adults in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fats are not the villain," Bikman says. "They're essential. They help you feel full, fuel your brain and support your gut and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His advice: embrace healthy fats — found in eggs, beef, olive oil, avocado, coconut and more. Ditch harmful seed and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are essential fatty acids and essential amino acids," Bikman says. "But there's no such thing as an essential carb."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From science to solution: The birth of HLTH Code&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, knowing the truth doesn't always make it easier to eat perfectly. Life gets busy. Stress sneaks in. And that's why Bikman and his team created &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt; — a nutritionally optimized, science-backed shake designed for real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with protein, collagen, probiotics, prebiotic fiber, apple cider vinegar, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats — without added sugar or artificial junk — it's engineered to check every box: weight management, gut health, brain health, energy, and even skin, hair and nail support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes it tastes amazing. "If it didn't, no one would stick with it," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solving hunger the right way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are "overfed but undernourished." We eat plenty of calories but not the right nutrients, leaving us hungry again an hour later. HLTH Code fixes that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each shake keeps you full for hours, fuels your body with what it actually needs, and costs much less than takeout or fast-food meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Replace one meal a day for wellness, or two if you're serious about weight loss," Bikman recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;five-star reviews&lt;/a&gt; back him up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"These are the best shakes I've ever had — tastes like heaven and keeps me full for hours!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Helped me break a weight loss plateau. Down 21 pounds."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Perfect for my intermittent fasting window. Energy, clarity, results."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why HLTH Code works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy weight loss isn't just about calories—it's about restoring your body's metabolic balance. &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code&lt;/a&gt; helps reset those signals so your body burns fat instead of storing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The science is clear," Bikman says. "When you give your body the right nutrition, everything changes — energy, immunity, brain function, appearance, and yes, weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk-free guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptical? Bikman gets it. That's why &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code&lt;/a&gt; offers a full satisfaction guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have nothing to lose but the extra pounds — and everything to gain in health, confidence, and vitality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to see the difference?

    &lt;p&gt;Over the past 40 years, Dr. Timothy Lepore has been the emergency room head, sole surgeon and medical examiner on Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Today he runs the only private practice, where he treats dozens of patients with &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/genetically-engineering-mice-to-cut-lyme-disease-transmission-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; each year. About 15% of residents on the island have been afflicted with the disease, which can cause a wide range of symptoms like a fever, rash, facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lepore, 80, may finally be able to retire if a team of scientists' dream to curb the transmission of Lyme disease on the island becomes a reality. The scientists' target is not the deer or ticks often associated with the disease: it's wild mice, the main host of Lyme bacteria. The hope is that by genetically engineering mice to be immune to Lyme and releasing them in Nantucket, the population of mice able to spread Lyme disease on the island will shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why scientists are zeroing in on Nantucket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem on Nantucket can be traced back to 1926, when the community voted to import two female deer to the island to give a lone buck company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, by the 1950s, half the land on the island was put into conservation. The untamed brush and wild grasslands create an ideal ecosystem for Lyme's hosts to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the deer population grew, so did the population of ticks. Deer don't get Lyme, but female ticks feed on them, and then lay as many as 2,000 eggs in a single batch. Deer also spread the disease as thousands of them carry ticks across Nantucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all ticks carry Lyme disease, and a tick bite doesn't guarantee the transmission. Even if the tick is carrying Lyme, the tick has to be attached for more than 24 hours to infect someone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most people associate Lyme disease with deer and ticks, white-footed mice are the main host of Lyme bacteria. When an uninfected tick bites an infected mouse, the bacteria transfer to the tick. When an infected tick then bites an uninfected mouse, the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a problem with tick-borne disease because we engineered the environment to maximize the number of ticks and maximize the number of mice that are the best hosts of Lyme disease," Kevin Esvelt, a genetic engineering pioneer and associate professor at MIT, said. "It came back and bit us, literally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but if left untreated, the infection can spread to the heart, joints and nervous system, as it did for 33-year-old Shauna Asplint, who was first diagnosed with Lyme when she was 10. A few years later, the left side of her face stopped moving, a residual effect from the disease still noticeable today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease afflicts nearly half a million people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is rarely fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What scientists are hoping to do &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Esvelt was the first to identify that CRISPR, a technology that allows scientists to modify DNA, could be used to change a species' genetics in perpetuity. His discovery led to Mice Against Ticks, a project run out of Esvelt's Sculpting Evolution lab at MIT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years, he and researcher Joanna Buchthal have looked into whether they could add a gene for an antibody that prevents Lyme disease to a mouse embryo that has progressed into two cells. The lab's technique involves injecting both cells to maximize the likelihood of getting the antibody into the DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injection mix contains both the antibody gene and CRISPR, which acts like molecular scissors. After CRISPR finds and cuts the targeted area of DNA, the cell inserts the antibody gene into the mouse's genetic code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the mouse is born, it will be immune to Lyme disease, and so will its children. The immunization is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed plan is to release thousands of engineered mice on Nantucket over time, starting during the winter months when the native mouse population is low. The immune mice wouldn't spread Lyme to ticks. Therefore, the scientists believe that as the immune population of mice grows, the spread of Lyme disease on the island will slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential consequences for messing with Mother Nature &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists' plan would, essentially, speed up evolution, a process that typically happens very slowly, over thousands or millions of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that's precisely why we have to be careful, because we are doing things that couldn't happen naturally," Esvelt said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esvelt needs the community to agree before he releases genetically engineered mice on Nantucket. Some there have concerns about the potential impact on Mother Nature. Scientists have presented their findings to locals at a series of town halls, which are followed by public Q&amp;amp;A sessions. One resident, who has had Lyme disease twice, thought the mice plan was a "cool" idea, but shared some reservations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mice are kinda the foundation of the food chain. So tinkering with the food chain makes me a little cautious," the resident said during a town hall last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have presented their latest findings to locals 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Telford, Esvelt's collaborator and an epidemiologist at Tufts University who's been studying ticks on Nantucket for the last 40 years, acknowledges that it would be more economical and straightforward to go out and poison the mice on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But then there's a whole food chain that might depend on these mice that would be impacted," Telford said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Timothy Lepore, the physician holding off on retirement, is supportive of the scientists' proposal, but as an avid falconer, he wants more testing done to ensure there won't be unintended consequences to the island's ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If federal and state regulators agree, the team plans to first release the engineered mice in a small field trial on a private island so that they can better understand the ecological impacts before any potential experiments on Nantucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esvelt admits he also worries about the impacts of messing around with Mother Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But, on the other hand, I'm not terribly fond of Mother Nature, if she's gonna give my kids disease," Esvelt said. "All of technology is saying to Mother Nature, 'You're beautiful. And we appreciate you very much and we need to conserve you. But we're not always happy with the way things work, naturally. And so we're going to change it.'"&lt;/p&gt;

only for him to become &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;paralyzed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;hours later—because of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rare brain disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; that makes cells bleed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The boy, a little league MVP, lost his ability to walk, talk, and even breathe independently in 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors then realized that the child had a cavernoma—a mulberry-like cluster of leaking cells near his brain stem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prognosis was dark: Casey heard that due to the condition that affects 1 in every 2,000 people, her boy would likely never walk again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;In another case, a pediatrician thought it was an earache &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another person to witness the medical anomaly in their offspring is Connie Lee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recalls how her four-month-old daughter struggled to sleep and started becoming progressively more irritable over the course of a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Daniel’s case, the doctor initially thought the infant was suffering from a minor ailment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pediatrician observed the child’s raised fontanelle (the soft spot on an infant’s skull), pondered on the probability of an earache, and prescribed amoxicillin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;An MRI showed that Connie Lee’s daughter had multiple tumors on her brain &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Lee returned home, her baby had started projectile vomiting, and thus she could not keep the medication down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This prompted a call to the doctor, who then scheduled an MRI at a children’s hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The resulting imagery would show that Lee’s months-old daughter’s brain had numerous tumors, the largest of which was four centimeters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“She was in crisis,” Lee recalled. “Had she not had the brain surgery that day, she would not be with us now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cavernous Malformations are raspberry-like clumps of leaking brain cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Connie Lee is also the CEO of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alliance to Cure Cavernous Malformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a patient research foundation and advocacy for people with the disorder .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Answering questions for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; on September 20, she described the condition as “abnormal” and “leaky” blood vessels that look like “a raspberry or mulberry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Blood tends to flow through them pretty slowly because they’re in the capillaries of the brain blood vessels and they can occur anywhere in the brain or in the spinal cord,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seizures are a telling sign of the disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee goes on to say that the most telling symptoms of cavernous malformation include focal seizures, which affect at least 50 percent of patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-laying-in-a-hospital-bed-in-front-of-a-monitor-jWJdT3chmWQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Getty/Unsplash;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Getty/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These events affect an area of the brain triggering failures in speech and vision and involuntary behaviors in the body while the patient is still conscious. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She further notes that the symptoms experienced by the patient “depends on where the  cavernous malformations are located,” explaining that they can translate into “abnormal body” movements and “weird smells that no one else around [the patient] can smell.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“About fifty percent show up with seizures that are focal seizures, meaning the seizures happening in just a small area of the brain,” Lee elaborated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another sign of Cavernous Malformation is a drooping face &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/alliancetocure/p/Cy3i52IquhN/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alliancetocure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;alliancetocure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Other folks, when they first have a Cavernous Malformation symptom, will have some sort of neurological deficit,” her explanation continued.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It can be face drooping or vision issues, weaknesses, numbness, tingling in arms and legs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Those are not necessarily related to the most severe presentation of CCM (cerebral cavernous malformation), which is hemorrhage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee went on to say Witten Daniel, the little boy who suffered complete paralysis in a matter of hours, fell into the category of CCM patients whose leaking blood vessels become full brain hemorrhages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and infants are more inclined to suffer sudden deteriorations &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/doctor-reading-brain-mri-x-ray-result-Jl_tNv6PEZA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Curated Lifestyle/Getty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Curated Lifestyle/Getty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among kids and infants, the condition more often than not goes undetected until the hemorrhage has progressed, and this is because they have difficulty accurately explaining what they are experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so for little kids, when we get to a point where this becomes emergent, where there’s an emergency, what we see are things like vomiting, projectile vomiting, floppiness, so this loss of muscle tone in infants especially.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And it can be mistaken for something that’s not as severe. The vomiting can be easily mistaken for flu,” Lee says, as a nod to Daniels’ experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains that although sudden deterioration like Witten’s is rare; it is more common in children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon experiencing symptoms, individuals should see a doctor or go to an emergency room&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Responding to the question on what action to take at the onset of these symptoms, Lee says that patients “certainly should take themselves to the emergency room to be checked, and that would include face drooping.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can sometimes just be something as simple as Bell’s palsy, which is not a serious condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It often resolves on its own, but it can also be the sign of something more serious. It’s better to be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The folks who are having focal seizures, that’s not as much of an emergency. You can take that to your regular doctor and then get a referral to neurology for further workup to see if there is some explanation for it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee explains that the most certain way to know is through diagnosis, which usually involves a CT scan and then an MRI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only two percent of Cavernous Malformation patients pass away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately, Witten’s sudden deterioration is not the norm, and the suddenness with which debilitates differ from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as harrowing and jarring as the effects may be, only two percent of diagnosed cases result in patients passing away eventually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.utphysicians.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UTHealth Houston;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UTHealth Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By and large, everyone else who has a cavernous malformation will either recover, and most people, even those who have brain hemorrhage, if it’s higher in the brain, frequently have good recovery, even almost back to normal, or if it’s in lower parts of the brain, they continue to have disabilities and deficits,” Lee elaborates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, due to the “higher plasticity” of children’s brains, they have a better chance of making faster and fuller recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only way to get a sure diagnosis is with an MRI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee’s organisation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alliance to Cure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.alliancetocure.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:notes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Cavernous Malformation is a rare disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, MRIs help with diagnosis with treatment options thereafter being available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So if there is a referral to MRI, the diagnosis is pretty simple and straightforward. To diagnose it works,” Lee observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;But getting a doctor to schedule an MRI can be tricky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So what stands in the way of getting an MRI? Multiple things. First off, the doctor needs to or the health care provider needs to believe you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you’re having neurological symptoms, sometimes they get tossed off as psychiatric symptoms or get attributed to some other physical disease that’s happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so it may take a while before you actually get to the point where the doctor will say, Oh, there’s something going on in your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We should give you an MRI.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and certain “populations” are not favored candidates for MRI’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think particularly there are populations in our country (the US) that don’t get the benefit of the doubt in the same way as others,” Lee observed, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and those folks typically take longer to get a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A second issue that gets in the way of diagnosis is with kids,” she continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/polygraph-parents-two-young-children-who-suddenly-vanished-revealed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; need to be sedated in order to have an MRI. MRI requires you to lie still for twenty five minutes or more, and children just can’t sustain that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So the sedation itself is a big deal. It requires time in pre op, in the MRI, and then in a recovery area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witten Daniel is home and well, and planning his return to the baseball field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a testimony to Lee’s assertions of the low mortality rate surrounding Cavernous Malformation, her daughter and Witten Daniel have made the next best thing to full recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Daniel’s case, it was Casey’s refusal to accept her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-left-puzzled-after-toddler-complains-of-hearing-ultrasound-photo-too-loud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:son;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s fate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a Google search, she connected with neurosurgeons Dr. Manish Shah and Dr. Jacques Morcos at Houston’s UTHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of this interaction, her son, now seven, is home again, preparing to return to the baseball field, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/09/12/lubbock-mother-says-google-search-saved-her-sons-life/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;KCBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears the internet rallied behind Witten Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 22:31:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9fV0MwY2loUDF4Y0JwNFVPaXpNa0tJNmlrd3paQTRYS3A5UFVFaHc4UEhzRkhncm5TUi1PaU5DUl9Oay1UY1Q2cUFVMTdfb2FNYVlqX2oxQ245aFZpdXM5aW5IN21LVlNBZGQ5S3lRMlNVcC1SOHJFQ2UyRQ</guid></item><item><title>“我们在几周内治愈癌症” ：人工智能创造合成蛋白质，而传统方法需要数年时间才能捕获肿瘤-粗鲁的法棍面包</title><link>https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/were-curing-cancer-in-weeks-ai-creates-synthetic-proteins-that-hunt-tumors-while-traditional-methods-take-years/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 Scientists leverage &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to rapidly create &lt;strong&gt;personalized immune therapies&lt;/strong&gt; for cancer treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚗️ Innovative AI designs &lt;strong&gt;minibinder proteins&lt;/strong&gt; that train the immune system to target cancer cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔍 Virtual safety checks enhance therapy &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; by preventing attacks on healthy cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏳ New method promises &lt;strong&gt;faster&lt;/strong&gt; and more &lt;strong&gt;precise&lt;/strong&gt; cancer treatments, transforming oncology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of cancer treatment is witnessing a revolutionary shift with the introduction of AI-driven methods to create personalized immune therapies rapidly. This groundbreaking approach utilizes artificial intelligence to design proteins that can effectively train the immune system to target cancer cells. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on finding natural immune matches—a process that can take years—this new technique accelerates the timeline significantly. Within just weeks, scientists can create synthetic proteins that direct immune cells to cancer targets, marking a significant advancement in cancer research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Faster Way to Train the Immune System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; highlights a significant leap forward in cancer treatment. Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark and the Scripps Research Institute have developed an AI platform to target cancer proteins, such as NY-ESO-1. This protein, prevalent in numerous tumors, has been a focal point for activating immune responses. By leveraging AI, scientists designed a minibinder protein that attaches to the NY-ESO-1 structure, enhancing the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involved inserting the AI-designed protein into immune cells, resulting in modified cells known as IMPAC-T cells. These cells demonstrated a robust capacity to identify and eliminate cancer cells marked by NY-ESO-1. The success of these laboratory experiments underscores the potential of AI in creating highly effective cancer-targeting therapies. As Kristoffer Haurum Johansen, a postdoctoral researcher involved in the study, noted, the AI-generated minibinders performed impressively well in laboratory settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fighting Cancer With Digital Blueprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative AI system extends beyond known cancer targets, offering a new avenue for precision medicine. Researchers tested the platform on a previously unmapped target from a metastatic melanoma patient. The system successfully generated minibinders for this novel target, demonstrating its potential to design therapies for previously untargetable cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XLwz0TcFeQ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/theyre-hijacking-nature-with-machines-this-quantum-gamble-in-denmark-fuels-global-tensions-over-microsofts-power-and-national-resistance/"&gt;“They’re Hijacking Nature with Machines”: This Quantum Gamble in Denmark Fuels Global Tensions Over Microsoft’s Power and National Resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability represents a transformative step in cancer treatment, enabling the creation of therapies tailored to the unique cancer markers in each patient. By utilizing digital models, scientists can bypass the limitations of existing data and immune cell availability. According to Timothy P. Jenkins, associate professor at DTU, the platform essentially provides a new set of tools for the immune system, designing molecular keys to target cancer cells with remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Screening to Improve Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of developing new immune therapies is ensuring they do not inadvertently attack healthy cells. Cancer markers often resemble proteins found in normal tissues, posing a risk of severe side effects if therapies bind to the wrong targets. To mitigate this risk, the research team implemented a "virtual safety check."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Precision in cancer treatment is crucial,” said Sine Reker Hadrup, professor at DTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/i-just-saw-impossible-scientists-prove-time-reflections-exist-leaving-experts-stunned-and-forcing-physics-to-rewrite-its-own-laws/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using computer simulations, the team tested each minibinder against a comprehensive range of pMHCs present on healthy cells. This preemptive screening allowed them to eliminate potentially harmful designs before reaching the lab testing phase. By predicting and ruling out cross-reactions during the design phase, researchers increased the likelihood of developing safe and effective therapies. This step is pivotal in ensuring the safe application of these treatments in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Bench to Bedside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lab results are promising, the journey from research to clinical application requires careful navigation. Jenkins estimates that it will take approximately five years before initiating clinical trials in humans. Once these trials commence, the treatment protocol will likely resemble existing methods used for certain blood cancers, involving the collection and modification of a patient’s immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new AI method promises to streamline and personalize the process. By utilizing digital tools to design a perfect match for each patient's tumor markers, the approach could revolutionize treatments for solid tumors, where current immune therapies have had limited success. This advancement paves the way for potentially treating cancers previously deemed untreatable and exploring rare or unique mutations overlooked by conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5LVxn9Sbff"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/students-build-rocket-engine-in-9-months-swiss-undergraduates-create-revolutionary-3d-printer-that-fuses-two-different-metals-simultaneously-while-cutting-production-time-by-67-percent/"&gt;“Students Build Rocket Engine In 9 Months”: Swiss Undergraduates Create Revolutionary 3D Printer That Fuses Two Different Metals Simultaneously While Cutting Production Time By 67 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Era in Precision Oncology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capability to design cancer-targeting proteins from scratch marks a pivotal moment in immunotherapy. This breakthrough illustrates the feasibility of transitioning from a digital blueprint to a functional immune therapy within a matter of weeks. The synthetic minibinders developed by the research team function comparably to natural receptors, effectively guiding T cells to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tested in laboratory settings, these engineered immune cells demonstrated comparable efficacy to those created through traditional methods, yet with faster and safer development processes. With ongoing refinement, AI-powered approaches could make personalized cancer treatments more accessible, precise, and swiftly deliverable. The future of immunotherapy is evolving beyond biological understanding to include the design of solutions through digital innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of AI in cancer treatment progresses, it raises important questions about the future of precision medicine. How will these advancements shape the landscape of oncology and patient care in the coming years?&lt;/p&gt;

When she woke up the next day, she felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda called her cousin and best friend throughout the day, telling the latter that she felt like she was “going to die.” When she didn’t check in the next day, her friend contacted the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marketing and advertising student was found unconscious in her dorm room and transported to the ICU at Leicester Royal Infirmary hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia. The serious bacterial infection caused bacterial meningitis, which led to sepsis. The college freshman underwent amputations to her fingers and both legs in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal disease, per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22442-meningococcal-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, is a bacterial infection that can be spread through spit or mucus. The illness can infect your meninges, which are the membranes that cover one’s brain and spinal cord, and blood. Some survivors have long-term complications, including brain damage, kidney damage, loss of limbs and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda, who wants to share her story to caution other students, said, “I have no memory of any of this, but I’m lucky to be alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student explained that when she arrived at the hospital, her blood oxygen level was at 1% and her blood wasn’t properly circulating through her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feet were green and swollen,” she said. "My organs were failing, and doctors told my family that if I woke at all I'd likely be brain dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda’s amputated legs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, Moponda was put into a coma and woke up two days later. She recalled that she “couldn’t see or speak and it was a whole week before I started speaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her treatment, the skin on her fingers and feet became swollen and painful because of the lack of blood flow. She also caught a flesh-eating infection on her buttocks, which was addressed with a skin graft from her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fingers were amputated at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham in December. Both of her legs were amputated right below the knee the following month.  "Basically my legs had died because of a lack of blood going to them," she said. "It was terrible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just kept crying all the time. I felt so hurt, it was killing my spirit," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda, who lived an active lifestyle and had aspirations to be a model, said she "just cried" when she woke up from the operation. "I felt like my whole life had just begun and now I had to start all over again differently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a

to walk again and is dedicated to breaking “all the barriers of disability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This doesn't make me less of a person,” Moponda said.  "I am unapologetically me and I want to help others to feel confident about who they are and how they look.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;paralyzed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;hours later—because of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rare brain disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; that makes cells bleed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The boy, a little league MVP, lost his ability to walk, talk, and even breathe independently in 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors then realized that the child had a cavernoma—a mulberry-like cluster of leaking cells near his brain stem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

pretty slowly because they’re in the capillaries of the brain blood vessels and they can occur anywhere in the brain or in the spinal cord,” she

and this is because they have difficulty accurately explaining what they are experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so for little kids, when we get to a point where this becomes emergent, where there’s an emergency, what we see are things like vomiting, projectile vomiting, floppiness, so this loss of muscle tone in infants especially.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And it can be mistaken for something that’s not as severe.

It’s better to be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The folks who are having focal seizures, that’s not as much of an emergency.

from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as harrowing and jarring as the effects may be, only two percent of diagnosed cases result in patients passing away

To diagnose it works,” Lee observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;But getting a doctor to schedule an MRI can be tricky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So what stands in the way of getting an MRI? Multiple things. First off, the doctor needs to or the health care provider needs to believe you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you’re having neurological symptoms, sometimes they get tossed off as psychiatric symptoms or get attributed to some other physical disease that’s happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so it may take a while before you actually get to the point where the doctor will say, Oh, there’s something going on in your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We should give you an MRI.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and certain “populations” are not favored candidates for MRI’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think particularly there are populations in our country (the US) that don’t get the benefit of the doubt in the same way as others,” Lee observed, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and those folks typically take longer to get a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A second issue that gets in the way of diagnosis is with kids,” she continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/polygraph-parents-two-young-children-who-suddenly-vanished-revealed/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; need to be sedated in order to have an MRI. MRI requires you to lie still for twenty five minutes or more, and children just can’t sustain that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So the sedation itself is a big deal. It requires time in pre op, in the MRI, and then in a recovery area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witten Daniel is home and well, and planning his return to the baseball field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a testimony to Lee’s assertions of the low mortality rate surrounding Cavernous Malformation, her daughter and Witten Daniel have made the next best thing to full recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Daniel’s case, it was Casey’s refusal to accept her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-left-puzzled-after-toddler-complains-of-hearing-ultrasound-photo-too-loud/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s fate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a Google search, she connected with neurosurgeons Dr. Manish Shah and Dr. Jacques Morcos at Houston’s UTHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of this interaction, her son, now seven, is home again, preparing to return to the baseball field, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/09/12/lubbock-mother-says-google-search-saved-her-sons-life/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;KCBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears the internet rallied behind Witten Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9370777" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9370777" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="16907"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9370777-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-cec2b290-9594-11f0-a631-b50140170532"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; issued a travel warning to the country in a bid to keep the virus from reaching the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also more warnings over malaria returning to the US, which &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12236947/Five-people-infected-malaria-Florida-Texas-potentially-fatal-disease-returns-US.html"&gt;kills up to 30 percent of untreated patients,&lt;/a&gt; after cases ticked up in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts told Daily Mail they were increasingly &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12717101/dengue-fever-usa-outbreak-decade.html"&gt;worried about mosquito-borne diseases advancing into the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharon Nachman, chief pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, told this website: 'Mosquito-borne diseases have spread in distance from down South, and we are seeing the mosquito pool slowly moving up the East Coast of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is of concern, as they do transmit infections, and if they transmit infections to people in these locations, people need to be aware of the diseases and how to get treated for them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above shows a Aedes albopictus mosquito, found in eastern, southern and central states. It can carry diseases like dengue, chikungunya and Zika&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows cases of West Nile Virus detected in the US by state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr Louisa Messenger, an environment and global health expert in Nevada, warned that her state had considered ramping up mosquito control efforts this year amid an explosion in its population of the biting insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost everyone gets bitten by mosquitoes, with experts saying it is likely that more than a hundred million bites take place in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these bites only result in a raised red bump for a few days, which may be itchy or become inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a number of cases the mosquito has transferred an infectious disease to the individual that can quickly trigger symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman added: 'If a child has had a recent mosquito bite and their behavior has changed or they have a rash, those are the sorts of things that their physician should look at.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid mosquito bites and the potential danger the pose, Daily Mail has rounded up expert-backed tips to keep you safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;REPELLENT &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are dozens of brands of mosquito repellent available in the US that can be sprayed onto the skin to ward off a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Nachman said she advises her patients to use ones that contain DEET, an active ingredient that can prevent bites from both ticks and mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For children, she recommended applying it to their clothes as opposed to their skin, saying this avoids it accidentally coming off during play or if children get wet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For adults, she said the spray should be applied to any exposed areas of skin that could be vulnerable to a bite such as the neck, face, arms, legs and ankles. It is recommended to reapply the repellent every few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said using DEET, picardin or IR3535-laced sprays could effectively ward off mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The repellents work by &lt;span&gt;obscuring the natural odor of the human body, that attracts mosquitoes, or repelling them on contact with the skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquitoes have taste receptors in their feet, which are repelled by substances like DEET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommended applying the sprays at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger added: 'I am often asked whether it is essential to use the chemicals because people don't like the fact they are sticky, stay on clothing, and they don't always want to put a harsh chemical on their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But studies show that these chemicals are safe for human use and work. While there is some evidence that eating cinnamon, garlic or lavender rosemary may work, I can't recommend these because they are not EPA-approved.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another repellent to prevent mosquito bites are burning coils, which contain chemicals like pyrethrins. These are released into the air to repel mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, experts said the best way to avoid bites without using repellent is wearing long-sleeved clothing that covers the arms and legs, a common target for mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;ZAPPERS AND TRAPPERS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people love to take a few moments outdoors to have dinner or read a book at dusk, which is also a peak time for mosquito activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zappers can help, though. They use ultraviolet light to attract mosquitoes before killing them with an electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traps may also be an option, which use human-like pheromones to attract mosquitoes before ensnaring them before they can land on a human and bite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These should be placed under bushes or near water sources, experts say, while zappers can be placed near where people gather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said: 'These can be effective, but it does depend on your local mosquito population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These traps will catch a few of the mosquitoes, but won't get everything, so it is likely you will still have some mosquitoes on your patio.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;TOPICAL PRODUCTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some people, dousing themselves in mosquito-repellent spray can feel arduous or even uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these cases, manufacturers have come up with alternative ways to apply mosquito repellent to the skin, including via a lotion or using mosquito repellent wipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommend applying these products to the same exposed areas of skin as spray-on repellent to ward off mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman said it was not clear how long these products would be effective, saying they could leave someone needing to continuously reapply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This all sounds well and good,' she said, 'but while it will work for a short time, whether it will work for longer is doubtful'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said: 'Over-the-counter lotions and wipes can be effective, and applying mosquito repellent to your skin is one of the best things you can do to avoid being bitten.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOME CARE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also many steps people can take at home to reduce their exposure to mosquitoes and their risk of being bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the top of Dr Nachman's list was emptying any containers near the home that contain stagnant water, which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stagnant water is a wonderful place for mosquitoes to bloom,' she said, 'if you have any, dump it out, it will reduce the mosquito population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that mosquitoes can breed in very small amounts of water, such as the equivalent to a bottlecap or tablespoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other suggestions include having net screens on the door or windows that are often open in the dusk or early morning to stop a mosquito from entering the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also say turning on the air conditioning in the evening can help, saying that the dry and cooler air causes any mosquitoes already in the house to become much less active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 18:38:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNYVJLSnRva05YRzZmX3d0b0d4MDZ3eEVucUFIQmdxRUh0aW9icG9yZXc3Y01SNC1sWGhfYWUtazZSSEk4aXVOaWxQS2k1OW5mM3pmRjUzazEzc3JsY2ZYR200dXdDUjBYWklBSnhFd2ZaRmtOMzFiSzRUa2pTR1V3aEZxWnh3dlhS0gGOAUFVX3lxTFBFdVZFNzBfbE53a2QzVlc1dUc2TkVTLXd0WTdhTVcyaTVlRkwxLXh1bnVvWHdaNHhTQk5reWlETFFNTEZOYm0zaldibzFwXzdDTm5vNHZJdW5sNGphY1RYUm9HWV9xVGJ5d3BONWNValVUdHFkVXRsQ09pZjc0V1cteXZjYzNYWUZVeGFwMXc</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法， 7种姿势错误会让你看起来比实际年龄更老- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-7-posture-mistakes-that-silently-make-you-look-older-than-you-are-according-to-physical-therapists/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="368" data-end="522"&gt;We spend so much time thinking about skincare routines, workout programs, and nutrition hacks to slow down aging. But posture? It rarely makes the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="524" data-end="880"&gt;The reality is that how you carry yourself can add or subtract years from your appearance. Physical therapists will tell you that posture doesn’t just affect how your body feels—it changes how others see you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="524" data-end="880"&gt;Rounded shoulders, forward necks, stiff knees… they all create the impression of being older, more tired, and less energized than you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="882" data-end="1037"&gt;The good news is that these patterns aren’t set in stone. With awareness and small tweaks, you can make your posture work for you instead of against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1039" data-end="1153"&gt;Here are seven common posture mistakes that silently age you—and what physical therapists recommend to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1160" data-end="1187"&gt;1. Slouching shoulders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1189" data-end="1373"&gt;Think about the last time you saw someone sitting in a café, shoulders rounded forward, spine collapsed into the chair. What did it say about them? Probably not “vital and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1375" data-end="1578"&gt;When your shoulders slump, your chest caves in and your upper back curves unnaturally. Not only does this contribute to chronic back pain, but it also projects the look of someone weighed down by life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1580" data-end="1767"&gt;Physical therapists often start with a simple cue: roll your shoulders back and down, as if you’re gently putting them in your back pockets. This opens the chest and realigns the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1769" data-end="2038"&gt;I’ve noticed this in my own life while editing photos for long stretches. I’ll get up and realize I’ve been sitting like a question mark. Just five minutes of doorway stretches—placing my forearms on each side of the frame and leaning forward—undoes hours of tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2040" data-end="2205"&gt;Slouching is more than a bad habit. It’s a visual signal that you’re carrying the weight of the world. Straightening up flips that signal into strength and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2212" data-end="2237"&gt;2. Forward head tilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2239" data-end="2273"&gt;“Text neck” is the new bad back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2275" data-end="2541"&gt;As Dr. Scott Bautch, a past president of the American Chiropractic Association’s Council on Occupational Health, has explained, “Your head weighs around 10–12 pounds, but every inch it tilts forward &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/what-is-text-neck?.com"&gt;adds significant pressure to your neck&lt;/a&gt;—up to 60 pounds of force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2543" data-end="2703"&gt;No wonder it ages your appearance. A head jutting forward not only strains muscles but creates that tired, stooped look we often associate with getting older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2705" data-end="2897"&gt;The correction? Bring screens to eye level, practice chin tucks (pulling your chin gently back without tilting the head up or down), and check your posture every time you pick up your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3119"&gt;I started keeping my laptop on a stack of books during writing sessions, and the difference was night and day. My neck no longer felt stiff at the end of the day, and my profile in photos looked more upright and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3121" data-end="3197"&gt;A small adjustment in head position instantly takes years off your stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3204" data-end="3224"&gt;3. Locked knees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3226" data-end="3311"&gt;Here’s a posture mistake most people never think about: standing with knees locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3313" data-end="3528"&gt;When you push your knees all the way back, you’re essentially jamming your joints and making your legs look stiff. It doesn’t just feel unnatural—it also adds an awkward, rigid quality to your whole body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3530" data-end="3727"&gt;Physical therapists encourage a &lt;a href="https://improveworkspace.com/should-my-knees-be-locked-or-slightly-bent-using-standing-desk/?.com"&gt;“soft bend.”&lt;/a&gt; Not exaggerated, just enough so your legs look dynamic instead of frozen. This distributes weight through your muscles instead of straining ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3729" data-end="4000"&gt;I picked this up while traveling in Tokyo. Watching commuters stand on crowded platforms, I noticed their knees weren’t rigid. They looked relaxed, balanced, and—despite the chaos around them—comfortable. It made me rethink the way I stand in line at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4002" data-end="4168"&gt;Want to try it? Next time you’re standing still, unlock your knees slightly and shift your weight gently between feet. You’ll not only feel younger, you’ll look it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4175" data-end="4209"&gt;4. Uneven weight distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4211" data-end="4363"&gt;Do you always lean on one hip while standing? Cross your legs the same way every time? Maybe you shift your weight into one side without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4365" data-end="4541"&gt;These habits build up asymmetry. Your muscles adapt unevenly, one side gets tighter, and eventually your whole stance tilts. Visually, it gives you a lopsided, fatigued look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4543" data-end="4705"&gt;As noted by physical therapist Dr. Vinh Pham, “Posture is not just about appearance—it’s about symmetry. When the body is balanced, it looks and feels younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4707" data-end="4944"&gt;One simple fix is to check your feet. Are they carrying equal weight? Stand tall, spread your weight evenly, and imagine a string pulling you upward from the crown of your head. Suddenly your stance projects balance instead of fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4946" data-end="5178"&gt;For me, this clicked during long photography sessions. I’d catch myself leaning on one hip while holding the camera. Once I learned to center my weight, I not only looked steadier, but my shots improved because my body was stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5185" data-end="5211"&gt;5. Rounded upper back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5213" data-end="5364"&gt;This one is practically the poster child of “looking older.” The rounded, hunched upper back—sometimes called &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/kyphosis-exercises?.com"&gt;kyphosis&lt;/a&gt;—isn’t limited to older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5366" data-end="5615"&gt;Desk jobs, laptop living, and endless hours of scrolling are giving younger people the same posture pattern. Once the thoracic spine curves forward, everything follows: the head juts out, the shoulders close in, and your presence looks diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5617" data-end="5867"&gt;The antidote? Extension exercises. Physical therapists recommend lying over a foam roller at mid-back level and gently arching backward, or strengthening the rhomboids (the muscles between your shoulder blades) with simple rows or band pull-aparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5869" data-end="6134"&gt;I’ve mentioned this in another post, but strength training in this area completely changed how I carry myself. Adding just a few sets of rows each week made my upper back feel sturdier—and people around me noticed I “look taller,” even though I’m the same height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6141" data-end="6163"&gt;6. Dropped pelvis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6165" data-end="6218"&gt;Your pelvis is the hidden puppet master of posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6220" data-end="6446"&gt;If it tilts forward too much, you develop swayback—your lower back curves excessively, and your stomach sticks out more than it should. Tilt it backward, and your lower spine flattens, creating a rigid, older-looking stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6448" data-end="6538"&gt;Both positions throw off your alignment, and both silently add years to your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6540" data-end="6782"&gt;Physical therapists often coach clients to find &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article-abstract/64/4/510/2727727?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;“neutral pelvis.”&lt;/a&gt; Imagine your pelvis as a bowl of water: tilt too far forward and it spills out the front; tilt too far back and it spills out the back. Neutral is when the water stays level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6784" data-end="7004"&gt;For me, yoga was the game changer. Moves like bridge pose and cat-cow helped me feel the difference between forward, backward, and neutral tilt. Once I learned that awareness, I could adjust it instantly in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7006" data-end="7113"&gt;Getting the pelvis right doesn’t just protect your spine—it makes your entire posture look more youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7120" data-end="7142"&gt;7. Shuffling gait&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7144" data-end="7203"&gt;Walking posture is just as important as standing posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7205" data-end="7424"&gt;A shuffling gait—short steps, little arm swing, eyes down—is one of the clearest signals of aging. But here’s the thing: it usually has nothing to do with age. More often it’s tight hips, weak glutes, or stiff ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7426" data-end="7649"&gt;Physical therapists recommend loosening up the hips with stretches, strengthening glutes with simple bridges or lunges, and consciously lengthening your stride. Even swinging your arms naturally as you walk adds vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7651" data-end="7931"&gt;I had to relearn this after spraining an ankle years ago. I found myself taking tiny steps out of caution, and the habit stuck. Once I did mobility work and got comfortable again, I noticed my walk regained a kind of bounce. Friends commented that I seemed “lighter on my feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7933" data-end="8036"&gt;That’s the magic of fixing gait—it doesn’t just change how you move, it changes how you’re perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8043" data-end="8063"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8065" data-end="8261"&gt;Posture is a silent language. It tells the world whether you’re energetic or weary, youthful or weighed down. And unlike skin creams or expensive treatments, it’s completely within your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8263" data-end="8498"&gt;Every one of these mistakes—slouching shoulders, forward head tilt, locked knees, uneven weight, rounded upper back, dropped pelvis, and shuffling gait—ages you unnecessarily. But each has a fix that doesn’t require hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8500" data-end="8637"&gt;Roll your shoulders back. Lift your head. Unlock your knees. Stand evenly. Open your upper back. Balance your pelvis. Walk with energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8639" data-end="8768"&gt;They’re small adjustments, but together they send a powerful message: I’m vibrant, I’m present, and I’m younger than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four schools in Hidalgo County are reporting cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a virus that's common in children and spreads easily through touch. So far, health officials say there are 60 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hand, Foot, Mouth Disease is a contagious viral infection that typically affects children, mostly younger children under the age of five," DHR Health Family Medicine Residency Program Director Dr. Naomi D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the disease is commonly spread at schools and daycares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There have not been a publicized list of the schools due to privacy reasons, but they are considering this an outbreak and are monitoring closely," D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED STORY:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.krgv.com/news/hidalgo-county-warns-residents-of-hand-foot-mouth-disease-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Hidalgo County warns residents of hand, foot, mouth disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parents like Jazlyn Mora, it's personal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharr mother says her one-year-old was diagnosed with Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[I noticed] when she wasn't eating and when the blisters started occurring," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mora says soon after, her daughter's temperature spiked to 102. It was then doctors diagnosed the one-year-old with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was not going to be a cure. Just to take the medicine on time and that she wasn't going to be able to eat for like a few days due to the pain that she's having in the mouth and all over the body," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mora's daughter doesn't go to daycare. It's why she says she was so surprised by her daughter's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I just feel like we need to be more clean inside the house, or maybe she touched something or ate something that wasn't good and contained bacteria," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease can be spread through touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Typically, children are touching every surface, and they're putting their hands in their mouth and it's very important that hand hygiene is the top priority," D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first signs are usually fever followed by sore throat and then blisters or ulcers around the mouth, on the gums, hands and bottom of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are encouraged to keep their child at home for about a week after being diagnosed to stop it from spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the disease lasts about seven to 10 days, and they should isolate the infected child for the first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart disease patients should get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, cardiology experts say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/should-you-eat-more-red-meat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you eat more red meat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Study: Lower targets for blood pressure can prevent heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/low-income-explains-poorer-survival-after-a-heart-attack-more-than-race-study-finds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Low income explains poorer survival after a heart attack more than race, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/an-annotated-page-from-heart"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; An annotated page from ‘Heart’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall. These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A moose in Minnesota stumbles onto the road. She circles, confused and dazed, unable to orient herself or recognize the danger of an oncoming semitruck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kills her is the impact of 13 tons of steel, but what causes her death is more complicated. Tunneling through her brain is a worm that doomed both of them to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commonly known as the brain worm,&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/parelaphostrongylus-tenuis"&gt;Parelaphostrongylus tenuis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a parasitic nematode that infects a large range of wild and domestic herbivores, such as moose and elk. The worm can migrate into the brain of unsuspecting hosts, where it may cause catastrophic disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-pigs-turn-neon-blue-in-california-triggering-warnings"&gt;Wild Pigs Turn 'Neon Blue' in California, Triggering Warnings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174866" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad.jpg" alt="Moose wandering onto road" class="wp-image-174866 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad.jpg 6224w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-2048x1537.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MooseWanderingOntoRoad-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 6224px) 100vw, 6224px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174866" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Big herbivores like moose, elk, and horses are susceptible to the parasite.

The &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/brainworm"&gt;symptoms of the disease&lt;/a&gt; can vary, from disorientation and circling to paralysis across the animal's back end, the inability to stand up and potentially death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utia.tennessee.edu/person/?id=8872"&gt;As parasitologists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessie-Richards"&gt;we've&lt;/a&gt; been studying the effects these worms can have on moose populations in Minnesota. Tracking the spread of parasites and diseases in wild moose populations helps wildlife managers preserve those populations and reduce the spread to other animals or livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/p-tenuis-brainworm"&gt;white-tailed deer can harbor these parasites&lt;/a&gt; without having any symptoms of disease, the worm can wreak havoc on populations of &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/ungulate"&gt;ungulates, like moose and elk&lt;/a&gt;, that aren't adapted to the parasite. And tracking the disease in the wild isn't easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The disease cycle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;White-tailed deer harboring these parasites may &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/brain-worm"&gt;shed the worms into their environment&lt;/a&gt; when they defecate. Snails and slugs then take up this larva, where it develops inside them to the point where it's capable of infecting other types of deer, moose, elk and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174846" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ParasiticNematodeParelaphostrongylusLifecycleW.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the different hosts and life stages of the parasitic nematode parelaphostrongylus" class="wp-image-174846 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ParasiticNematodeParelaphostrongylusLifecycleW.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ParasiticNematodeParelaphostrongylusLifecycleW-600x379.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174846" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain worm life cycle. (Jesse Richards)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us as parasitologists, the biggest challenge lies in detecting the disease before it irreversibly damages its host. Only white-tailed deer pass the parasite in their feces. This means we can't detect this parasite by analyzing the poop of moose, or any animal, besides the white-tailed deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an animal is visibly sick, it's too late for it to make a recovery. Only after their death can we recover the body and identify the parasite from where it's embedded in the brain or spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even once we've recovered the body, finding a single, threadlike worm within the entirety of a moose or elk's nervous system is time-consuming and often futile. Usually, wildlife biologists can only tell that an animal was infected by looking at microscopic evidence that suggests a parasite migrated through the central nervous system, and by analyzing DNA fragments left behind by the worm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnostic confusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make things even harder, disease signs caused by other worms, like the arterial worm &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/integumentary-system/helminths-of-the-skin/elaeophorosis-in-animals#Clinical-Findings_v44821716"&gt;Elaeophora schneideri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, look similar to brain worm and can affect Minnesota moose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arterial worm generally lives in the neck of black-tailed deer and mule deer. Like &lt;em&gt;P. tenuis&lt;/em&gt;, this parasite moves around in the bodies of hosts that aren't adapted to it, and can cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologists attempting to diagnose a wild moose based on the visible clinical signs alone could easily confuse these two parasites and incorrectly conclude which parasite may have caused the disease. Given that the transmission of the parasites are vastly different, separate mitigation steps would be employed to minimize transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, biologists diagnosing based on microscopic findings in samples from the animal's body still risk misidentifying the worm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to get an accurate diagnosis is through &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK115571/"&gt;genetic analysis&lt;/a&gt; – analyzing the DNA sequence of the worm causing disease. The DNA sequence will tell researchers whether it is &lt;em&gt;P. tenuis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;E. schneideri&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serological testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While genetic analysis can help researchers monitor the presence of the disease in a population, they &lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/p-tenuis-brainworm"&gt;can't use it to diagnose live animals&lt;/a&gt;. But our team, with colleagues at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine's molecular diagnostic lab, has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37481-7"&gt;created a test&lt;/a&gt; that can help diagnose animals while they're alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a moose or elk has a brain worm, its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10207376/"&gt;cells produce antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which are a type of protein in the blood that try to defend against the parasite. Our &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/serology-test"&gt;serological test&lt;/a&gt; looks for these  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="174834" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in an animal's blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perform the testing, wildlife health specialists collect blood from sick or recently deceased animals and ship it to the lab. There, scientists run part of the blood through a test that looks for these specific antibodies against &lt;em&gt;P. tenuis&lt;/em&gt;, so the animal isn't misdiagnosed with another type of parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test, which the molecular diagnostic lab is now using to test samples sent in from across the country, has helped us monitor populations of moose and elk for this parasite. It can detect the parasite's presence while the animals are still alive and without expensive genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ripple effects from testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Minnesotan moose from our example is hit by a semitruck, wildlife officials find the deceased moose on the side of the road and quickly take a sample of her blood for testing. They send it off to the University of Tennessee, where it joins thousands of other samples from moose, elk and even caribou across North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each submission helps our colleagues in the molecular diagnostic lab improve the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test can also screen blood samples from animals that live in areas where researchers haven't detected&lt;em&gt; P. tenuis&lt;/em&gt;. If positive, those results may alert biologists that the parasite is expanding into new areas and help them manage populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a test at the molecular diagnostic lab indicates that the parasite is present in a new population early on, they will have more time to try to curb the disease spread. Wildlife managers may try to reduce snail and slug populations &lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire"&gt;with controlled burns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, they might increase how many white-tailed deer hunters in the area can harvest to reduce the deer population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that in the future, other researchers will use the techniques behind this serological test to make similar tests for other infectious disease agents containing RNA or DNA.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/214908/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The research also reveals that these stomach and digestive issues are linked to greater challenges with sleep, communication, sensory processing, and behavior. The findings were published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251362349" target="_blank"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a developmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts with others, and experiences the world around them. It is common for individuals with autism to show a preference for routines and engage in repetitive behaviors. It has long been observed that children with autism frequently experience other medical conditions, with gastrointestinal problems being among the most common complaints. While this connection is known, much less is understood about how these digestive issues progress throughout a child’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies that explored this link relied on reviewing past medical records, which may not capture a complete picture of a child’s day-to-day experience. Scientists at the University of California Davis MIND Institute sought to address this gap by following a group of children over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to get a more direct and detailed view of the frequency and persistence of these symptoms. The researchers hypothesized that gastrointestinal symptoms would be both more common and more enduring in children with autism. They also predicted that this physical discomfort would be associated with greater challenges in other areas of development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was a component of a larger, ongoing study called the Autism Phenome Project. It included 322 children diagnosed with autism and 153 typically developing children who served as a comparison group. Researchers collected information from the children and their families at three different points in time. The first assessment occurred when the children were between two and four years old. A second assessment took place two years later, and a final one happened during middle childhood, when the children were between nine and twelve years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each visit, a developmental pediatrician who specializes in autism interviewed caregivers using a detailed questionnaire. This questionnaire asked about nine common gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, gassiness or bloating, diarrhea, constipation, pain during bowel movements, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took specific steps to only include symptoms that did not have a known medical explanation. They excluded children from the gastrointestinal symptom group if their issues were explained by diagnosed conditions like celiac disease, chronic gastritis, or specific food allergies that were being managed. This allowed the team to focus on digestive problems without a clear underlying cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to questions about digestive health, parents also completed a wide range of established questionnaires designed to evaluate their child’s cognitive abilities, social skills, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, sleep habits, and general emotional and behavioral well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the multi-year study confirmed the researchers’ initial expectations. Children with autism were about twice as likely to experience gastrointestinal symptoms at any given time point compared to their typically developing peers. The data showed that these problems were not only more common but also significantly more persistent in the autism group. While nearly two-thirds of the typically developing children never reported any of the nine targeted gastrointestinal symptoms across all visits, this was true for only about one-third of the children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was even more apparent when looking at chronic issues. Among the children who participated in all three assessments, 30 percent of those with autism had gastrointestinal symptoms reported at every single visit. This rate of persistence was more than four times higher than the 7 percent observed in the typically developing group. Children with autism also tended to experience more digestive issues at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, they had about 2.4 more co-occurring symptoms, such as having both constipation and bloating, than children in the comparison group. The most frequently reported problems in both groups were constipation, diarrhea, gassiness, and abdominal pain, but these were all reported at higher rates for the children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also provided strong evidence for a connection between these physical symptoms and a child’s daily functioning. The analysis showed that, across both groups, the simple presence of gastrointestinal issues was associated with more significant challenges. Children with digestive problems, whether they had autism or not, tended to have more sleep difficulties, increased anxiety and depression, more complaints of physical discomfort, and greater sensitivity to sounds and sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking exclusively at the group of children with autism, the researchers found what could be described as a dose-response relationship. The more gastrointestinal symptoms a child experienced, the more pronounced their difficulties were across a broad spectrum of areas. An increasing number of digestive problems was directly linked to more intense repetitive behaviors, greater challenges with social communication, and heightened sensory sensitivities related to touch, taste, and smell. This pattern also extended to sleep, where a higher number of symptoms was associated with a wide array of disturbances, from breathing problems during sleep to significant daytime sleepiness and frequent night wakings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the paper pointed out several limitations to their work. The information on digestive health relied on parent reports rather than direct medical examinations or lab tests. The study was also conducted at a single research center in California, which means the results may not be generalizable to all populations. Like many long-term studies, some families discontinued their participation over the years. The research team did analyze this and found that this attrition did not appear to significantly alter their main findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these considerations, the study’s findings have important implications for clinicians, families, and researchers. The results highlight a clear need for doctors and parents to be aware of the high rate of persistent gastrointestinal problems in children with autism. The emergence of new behavioral challenges or the worsening of existing ones might be an outward sign of underlying physical pain or discomfort that a child cannot easily communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that screening for and effectively treating these digestive problems could lead to substantial improvements in a child’s overall well-being, daily functioning, and quality of life. Future research can build on these findings to explore the root causes of these gastrointestinal issues in the autistic population and to develop better ways to identify and support children who are most at risk for chronic digestive distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251362349" target="_blank"&gt;A longitudinal evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Bibiana Restrepo, Sandra L.

That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a commentary published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's disease have surged by more than 140%," said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. "At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline - potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement - reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes - previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer - also hold transformative potential for brain health," Hennekens said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous," said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. "Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline - tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia - amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health," said Hennekens. "Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(AP) — Drugstores are ready to deliver updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall and insurers plan to pay for them, even though the shots no longer come recommended by an important government committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-advisers-vaccines-hepatitis-b-covid19-a1fb61ef7e29d93d2828618d890cceb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declined to specifically recommend the shots but said people could make individual decisions on whether to get them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations normally trigger several layers of insurance coverage and allow drugstores in many states to deliver the shots. But insurers and government officials have said coverage will continue, and several states have allowed for vaccine access through pharmacies, the most common place to get shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against any winter surges in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the issue.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Will insurers cover these shots?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many are expected to do so, but you still may want to check with yours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The VFC program normally automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One caveat: Large employers that offer coverage will make their own decisions on the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They may be motivated to continue coverage: The vaccines can help ward off expensive hospital bills from people who develop a bad case of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where people can get vaccinations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Access to the shots has grown after &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-access-limitations-645d64cee13664840fc9a39ff2d309c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a clunky start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to vaccine season that saw some people travel to nearby states when they couldn’t make appointments at pharmacies closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drugstore chains like CVS say their locations are stocked with the latest vaccines, and they now are able to deliver vaccinations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Prescriptions are required in D.C. and a handful of states, including Florida and Georgia, CVS Health spokeswoman Amy Thibault said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walgreens also requires prescriptions in a few states, a company spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who can get the shot&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recently approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the shots for all people age 65 and older, and for younger adults and children with conditions that put them at high risk for catching a bad case of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC maintains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of conditions that would put someone at high risk, including asthma, cancer, heart or lung problems, obesity, depression and a history of smoking. It also includes those who are physically inactive, and the agency notes that this list is not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Patients can consult with their doctor or care provider to decide whether they are high risk if they don’t have a condition on that list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;

(WTVD) -- &lt;/span&gt;Small cell lung cancer is one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of lung cancer commonly associated with smoking. Now, researchers at Duke Health have uncovered a surprising new origin of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Inside the lab, Duke scientists developed advanced models to trace how tumor cells evolve and how they might be stopped before the cancer spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For decades, scientists believed small cell lung cancers started in specialized cells called neuroendocrine cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Duke study reveals the cancer likely begins in basal stem cells which can shapeshift into multiple types of lung cells, allowing the cancer to evade the immune system and spread.

"And we also see implications that the immune system responds to these cells differently, with some hope that we can get the immune system involved to go after the cancer more effectively in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Duke study was published in&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nature.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt; the journal Nature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 WTVD-TV.

Then, earlier this month, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), released the "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report. Among the ways the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/make-our-children-healthy-again-maha-report-2025-11807251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20-page report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20-page report&lt;/a&gt; could reshape the nation’s food policy is a push to deregulate food, with the HHS, FDA, and USDA planning to remove “restrictions on whole milk sales in schools, allowing districts to offer full-fat dairy options alongside reduced-fat alternatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has a questionable track record on milk — he says he only drinks raw milk, despite repeated agreement among experts that it’s nutritionally equivalent to but poses much greater health risks than pasteurized milk. So is it wise to trust his gut in this case? Is whole milk actually a nutritious drink that should be reintroduced to schools for the sake of kids’ well-being?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is whole milk — and how does it differ from other types?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whole milk might sound indulgent, but nutritionally, it’s not so different from the lower-fat options you see on the shelf,” says &lt;a href="https://www.usdairy.com/about-us/national-dairy-council/leadership/ndc-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Katie Brown, EdD, RDN, FAND, FASN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Katie Brown, EdD, RDN, FAND, FASN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, executive vice president of Dairy Management Inc., and president of the National Dairy Council.

This fat adds flavor to whole milk and gives it a creamier texture compared to other types — so what’s the downside?

Saunders, DO, IFMCP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Tyler J. Saunders, DO, IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internal medicine physician focused on longevity and preventive medicine. Among other concerns, a diet high in saturated fat could lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research suggests that whole milk may not pose the cardiovascular risks once feared, though. A 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165%2825%2900137-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors between people who drink full-fat and low-fat milk. The researchers concluded that cutting back on ultra-processed, nutrient-poor foods might be more important for heart health than whether you choose whole or skim milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saunders concurs. “While high levels of saturated fat in the context of processed foods may be concerning, saturated fats from whole foods like dairy do not appear to cause heart disease,” he says. This shift in understanding has influenced modern dietary fat recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is milk good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk, including whole milk, provides a complete, high-quality protein and other nutrients that help keep you full, support energy, and assist in muscle repair, says &lt;a href="https://thesolutionissleep.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell&lt;/a&gt;, the board-certified physician and clinical sleep specialist behind The Solution Is Sleep. Those are all good things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children, these benefits are especially important. “In the first 1,000 days of life — spanning from conception to two years of age — rapid brain growth depends on key nutrients. Dairy milk provides seven of the 14 nutrients identified by the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/141/2/e20173716/38085/Advocacy-for-Improving-Nutrition-in-the-First-1000?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Academy of Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; as essential for early brain development, such as protein, iodine, zinc, choline, vitamin B12, selenium, and vitamin A,” Dr. Holliday-Bell explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/goat-milk-anti-aging-muscle-benefits-study-11784847" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Tested 4 Types of Milk — This One Stood Out for Muscle and Gut Health Benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Tested 4 Types of Milk — This One Stood Out for Muscle and Gut Health Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk naturally contains electrolytes, making it a surprisingly effective hydration choice. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26702122/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; even shows that milk can be more hydrating than water or sports drinks due to its balance of protein, carbohydrates, and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk is also budget-friendly. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842517/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMilk%20and%20dairy%E2%80%9D%20were%20the,least%20expensive%20sources%20of%20choline." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows dairy products are the least expensive sources of calcium and vitamin D in the American diet, costing about 25 cents per eight-ounce glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is whole milk even better for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to milk’s other nutritional benefits, whole milk may promote satiety, support weight management, and enhance metabolic health, says Dr. Holliday-Bell, as the combination of fat and protein helps you feel full longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies in children suggest those who drink whole milk have lower odds of being overweight compared with reduced-fat milk drinkers, and large cohort studies in adults have linked higher dairy-fat intake to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twiggs notes that regular consumption of whole milk within the context of a calorie-controlled diet may support weight management in children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much whole milk can I drink?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because experts are reassessing whole milk’s nutritional value, doesn’t mean they’re now recommending unchecked consumption; they still emphasize moderation and quality. &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/harpreet-pall/1316806" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harpreet Pall, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harpreet Pall, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer and pediatric gastroenterologist at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Hospital and K. Hovnanian Children’s Hospital in Neptune, New Jersey, recommends plain, pasteurized dairy milk without added sweeteners or flavorings. He mentions that if a child is overweight, their pediatrician might adjust milk recommendations on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/dairy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, total daily dairy intake recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toddlers (12 to 23 months):&lt;/strong&gt; 1 2/3 to 2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children (2 to 3 years):&lt;/strong&gt; 2 to 2 1/2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children (4 to 8 years):&lt;/strong&gt; 2 1/2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kids (9 years and older) and adults:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the Dietary Guidelines do not specify an exact amount of milk to include in your diet but instead focus on the broader dairy group, which includes milk, yogurt, and cheese. This group, however, excludes “foods made from milk that have little calcium and a high fat content,” such as butter, cream cheese, and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For toddlers and young children, Brown recommends offering milk with meals and water in between. Drinking too much milk can crowd out other nutrient-rich foods, especially those high in iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does whole milk compare to plant-based milks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based alternatives to dairy milk, like almond or oat milk, differ nutritionally. Most contain only one to two grams of incomplete protein per cup, missing essential amino acids. These plant-based options also often have lengthy ingredient lists, while dairy milk remains simple — just milk, often fortified with vitamin A and D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when [plant-based milk is] fortified, the nutrient bioavailability may differ from that of natural dairy,” explains Dr. Saunders. According to Dr. Pall, the addition of sweeteners in plant-based milks, especially those for children, can also offset nutritional gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line on whole milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk of any type provides high-quality protein and 12 other essential nutrients, so experts say it’s a good choice for kids and adults in moderation. Whole milk might even provide additional benefits thanks to the very fat that once made it a pariah among health professionals, so don’t be dismayed if you see the creamy drink on your kids’ lunch menus. Although RFK Jr. may not have expert support on raw milk, the science is on his side when it comes to whole milk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/whole-milk-nutrition-11809651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:07:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxORXd1Tl91YTN0YnJYazdTT0hsUnVpa19OeHZncUhwMUpMS0dfRUxrU1daRktKQklLQ3Bhb0pfai0xU001SWJ1MGdrck9VLTdMQm1vRGpadnNKVjRUd0t3bVlwSkpPQzZBMjFmdTFOZWRCTVdEU1psUUxlSU1KejlmX2RB</guid></item><item><title>加强骨骼的新突破可以逆转骨质疏松症- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-strengthen-bones-could-reverse-osteoporosis</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading researchers to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-took-mice-into-space-and-it-did-something-scary-to-their-bones"&gt;NASA Took Mice Into Space, And It Did Something Scary to Their Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503. In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant. (&lt;span&gt;Biorender, Ines Liebscher&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say future treatments could be used to strengthen bones that are already healthy, and build degraded bone back up to full strength, as in cases of osteoporosis in women who are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-symptoms-may-be-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-study-shows"&gt;going through menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are actually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;numerous factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that have an influence on bone strength, and that gives scientists plenty of scope for finding methods &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-bones-could-soon-heal-a-whole-lot-better-thanks-to-polymer-nanoshells"&gt;that ward off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; issues like osteoporosis and promote a healthier old age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a serious condition affecting millions worldwide. While available treatments can &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/"&gt;slow the condition's progress&lt;/a&gt;, there's no way to reverse or cure the condition. Current treatments also tend to come with risky side effects (like an increased risk of other diseases) or become less effective over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The newly demonstrated parallel strengthening of bone once again highlights the great potential this receptor holds for medical applications in an aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Juliane Lehmann, from the University of Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02291-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is really doing as secretary of health and human services—and the danger to which he’s likely exposing the American public—look back at what happened over three remarkable days last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/16/cdc-turmoil-senate-testimony-susan-monarez-debra-houry/" rel&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/fired-cdc-director-describes-pressure-kennedy-over-vaccines" rel&gt;Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the former CDC director whom Kennedy forced out of her job just weeks after she had started. It was Monarez’s first public appearance since the firing, and she had a lot to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/09/03/robert-kennedy-cdc-health-policy/" rel&gt;Debra Houry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a veteran physician and administrator who resigned as CDC medical director in protest of Kennedy’s policies, Monarez described the ways she said Kennedy was sidelining or firing anybody who might object to his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rfk-jr-s-history-of-medical-misinformation-raises-concerns-over-hhs-nomination/" rel&gt;widely discredited ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/" rel&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That included, she said, the time Kennedy demanded she preemptively endorse changes in vaccine recommendations for children—a demand she says she refused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity,” Monarez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was just a warmup for Thursday and Friday, when the CDC’s official &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/aug/advisory-committee-immunization-practices-what-it-does" rel&gt;advisory committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on immunization met to consider some of those aforementioned vaccine-recommendation changes. The committee was full of Kennedy appointees he’d put there after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/kennedy-removes-all-acip-members-eyes-replacements" rel&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the scientists who had been on the panel before. And the proceedings unfolded about how you’d expect, with familiar, scientifically questionable &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-continues-to-support-access-to-routine-immunizations-for-every-child-in-every-community/" rel&gt;assertions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about alleged vaccine harms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the meeting also stood out for its disarray. One particularly memorable sequence started at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-meeting-hepatitis-covid.html" rel&gt;end of Thursday’s session&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when the panel prepared to vote on a resolution that would affect availability of the MMRV shot, which combines immunization for varicella (chickenpox) with immunization for measles, mumps, and rubella.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The resolution’s wording and meaning were unclear, as one panelist protested openly. The panel approved it anyway, only to hold a new vote—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546769/cdc-vaccine-acip-hepatitis-b-covid" rel&gt;and reverse the decision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—at the start of Friday’s session, evidently because several other panelists had also been confused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are rookies,” chairman Martin Kulldorff acknowledged in his opening remarks Friday—which perhaps understated things, given that five of the twelve members hadn’t even been named until &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/cdc-acip-new-members" rel&gt;four days before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot of that MMRV debate is that few children are likely to get the combined shot anymore. And while that’s not earth-shattering, because most kids already get two separate shots anyway, the decision along with the rest of the week’s developments were the clearest sign yet of Kennedy’s true intentions. Although he insists he is not anti-vax—that he simply wants to promote choice, and to uphold “gold-standard science”—he keeps finding ways to make vaccines less accessible and, in so doing, to reduce vaccination rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week showcased another, equally important side of Kennedy’s management: the way he is eliminating the people and dispensing with the procedures that allow agencies like the CDC to carry out their basic functions in a transparent, scientifically sound way. The effect isn’t so much to realign priorities as it is to unleash chaos. But that can still be corrosive to the government’s credibility—and hazardous to the people who depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;STRICTLY SPEAKING, little of what Monarez said on Wednesday was new. The basic outlines of her saga as she remembers it—that she’d refused to fall in line with Kennedy’s vaccine directives and refused to fire career scientists like Houry—were already out there, thanks to news reporting and a short &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhEEjlmeI8DFQL2-DH9Tprr6Q34Us0cAI1w5es45XlBQcgYNlvnskxqbHtS2Yo%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68cdda4f&amp;amp;gaa_sig=UAa3AdLNu4tfcAOlK-n2-jvGfk4j_mcwdxxa-SdI-mPoFU9IU9jiuVCa5pa11DnGMmz-jmEi-dG4U3H5JpLSMQ%3D%3D" rel&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Monarez had written for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; a week before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the versions of the stories that Monarez and Houry told over the course of their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25vDjs0iy_k" rel&gt;nearly three-hour testimony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; were more detailed and vivid. Together, they painted a picture of a temperamental, controlling, and downright ignorant cabinet secretary that at any other time—and in any other administration—would have created a political firestorm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the Texas measles outbreak, Monarez said, neither she nor any of the career CDC scientists briefed Kennedy—something highly unusual for any outbreak, let alone one that had resulted in the first child measles deaths in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/child-dies-of-measles-heres-a-look-at-the-countrys-re-emerging-disease" rel&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But the outbreak still kept her busy, in part because Kennedy was putting out so many false statements about vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said things like ‘vaccines had fetal parts,’” Monarez said, “and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fealty to Kennedy was also an issue: Monarez said that she was instructed to communicate about sensitive matters only with his political appointees, not career officials. In addition, she said, she was admonished not to communicate directly with members of the Senate HELP committee, who have oversight responsibility over the CDC and to whom she’d gone with some of her concerns about Kennedy’s decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most difficult moments, Monarez said, were when Kennedy disparaged CDC staff: “He called . . . CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world, emphasized that CDC employees were horrible people. . . . He said that CDC employees were killing children and they don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of that was a prelude to Monarez’s confrontation with Kennedy over changes to children’s vaccine recommendations, which he said would be coming in September. In her recollection, Kennedy wanted a promise that she’d endorse whatever the advisory committee recommended—a promise that she felt would &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/scientific-integrity/php/about/index.html" rel&gt;violate her duty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to evaluate such recommendations on the merits, and that she says she would not make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He was very upset,” Monarez said. “The entire meeting was very tense. He was very upset throughout the entirety of our discussion, and it was not a productive exchange of information.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monarez was composed throughout the hearing, even as GOP senators tried to paint her as a partisan operative out to make Donald Trump look bad. (Mind you, these senators were part of the unanimous Republican vote to confirm Monarez two months earlier after her nomination by Trump.) At one point, Oklahoma Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/gop-senator-fact-checked-on-live" rel&gt;said he had a recording&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that showed Monarez was lying about a key conversation she’d had with Kennedy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stood her ground, and Mullin later withdrew the allegation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That doesn’t mean everything she and Houry said happened exactly as they recounted it. Even the most honorable witnesses can misremember things. But the stories they told about Kennedy line up well with his public record of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" rel&gt;downplaying the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, spreading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" rel&gt;false information about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-cdc-fascism-abuse-catholic-church-autism-conferences-rcna181605" rel&gt;attacking the CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—not to mention the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/4-major-moments-from-rfk-jr-s-contentious-hearing-with-senators" rel&gt;agitated, angry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; persona that was on display when he testified before another Senate committee two weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that evidence alone doesn’t back up Monarez’s version of events, what unfolded in the advisory meetings Thursday and Friday sure did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share The Bulwark","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share The Bulwark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEETINGS OF THE Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (that’s the official title) are typically sleepy, technical affairs, and pretty well orchestrated too. That’s not to say outcomes are preordained, or that they can’t be contentious. But the tone and pace is typically more academic than antagonistic. Following procedural rules is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s difficult to capture all the ways in which last week’s meeting deviated from those norms, because it was so full of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/20/acip-vaccine-cdc-criticism-rfk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel&gt;bizarre moments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—like the time on Friday morning when an open mic caught somebody saying “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/ddiamond/status/1969041100259070315" rel&gt;you’re an idiot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” while committee member and MIT professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi" rel&gt;Retsef Levi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7anl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eceba06-9f28-4a2e-ba8a-6960b916e5d6_3000x2000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;At the meeting of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on September 19, 2025. Retsef Levi (center) is speaking; chairman Martin Kulldorff is at left. (Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But decorum wasn’t the meeting’s only casualty. Intellectual integrity took a blow too. The committee’s usual process for taking up a new proposal is to announce that it will be on the agenda weeks, if not months, before a meeting—and then assign working groups, staffed by CDC scientists, who can carefully study the available research before making presentations to the full committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently presentations won’t even lead to immediate votes, with the committee instead deciding to continue deliberating—and, perhaps, getting more input from the working groups. The process is methodical by design, because the idea is to make sure the committee members are working from research that has gone through a rigorous review, from analysts with deep expertise—and that they’ll have enough time to thoroughly understand the science and the stakes, and to think through changes before making them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week’s meeting didn’t work like that at all. Scientists from the agency’s vaccine center “were completely shut out” of the preparations, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/what-acip-meeting-says-about-vaccine-schedule-rfk-restoring-trust-vaccines/" rel&gt;STAT News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The resolutions up for debate were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/sarahdespres/status/1969079192642867403" rel&gt;not posted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in advance of the meeting, nor were presentations that—as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1969102133204304070" rel&gt;observers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the proceedings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimitridrekonja.bsky.social/post/3lz7g4epw2s2s" rel&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—included papers that had not gone through peer review, and leaned on unproven claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result was a series of unsubstantiated, ill-informed statements—like the time one panelist asked about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/doritmi/status/1968688874181345480" rel&gt;adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a vaccine that doesn’t contain them, or moments when panelists seemed not to understand their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/doritmi/status/1969392543407489062?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—that had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Atul_Gawande/status/1969034028104691920?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimitridrekonja.bsky.social/post/3lz77e76phs25" rel&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/krutikakuppalli/status/1969136431164497981?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;from&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/jsm2334/status/1969035464498676098" rel&gt;around&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/benmazer/status/1969083924430086649?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/crabb_vicki/status/1969129111420272889" rel&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1969152356269822029" rel&gt;aghast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Among them was Stanley Plotkin, who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/history/stanley-plotkin-md/overview" rel&gt;developed the rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 1960s and is the author of the field’s standard textbook, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotkin%27s_Vaccines" rel&gt;Plotkin’s Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. After watching the proceedings, he wrote an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/retsefl/status/1969216390310551964" rel&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to Levi stating, “Please consider whether your grasp of immunology and public health is sufficient to make recommendations that will result in more disease. Modesty about your basic knowledge would help.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More knowledge about the realities of American &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/sick-jonathan-cohn?variant=32130588508194" rel&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250270931/thetenyearwar/" rel&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; might have helped too—especially a debate about the timing of vaccines for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-kennedy-acip-crusade-against-vaccines-hepatitis-b" rel&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a potentially lethal disease newborns can acquire from their mothers during birth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC since 1991 has recommended administering the first dose before infants leave the hospital. A proposal before the committee last week called for pushing the first dose to one month, when doctors know a woman has tested negative for hep B during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposal’s proponents noted that most Western and Northern European countries have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/humanspective/status/1968872290302755190?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;similar standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They did not acknowledge—and maybe did not grasp—that the situations are not comparable because those countries have seamless universal health care systems that consistently provide prenatal care and feature up-to-date, easily shareable medical records.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the patchwork U.S. health care system, with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2024/nov/state-health-insurance-coverage-us-2024-biennial-survey" rel&gt;inconsistent access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/10/30/16228054/american-medical-system-fax-machines-why" rel&gt;archaic recordkeeping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, selective recommendation is bound to miss a lot of cases—and in fact already did once, during the early years of the vaccine. Back then, roughly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/17/hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-risk/" rel&gt;20,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; kids a year were getting hep B. It’s the main reason CDC switched to an at-birth dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One panelist, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=8272" rel&gt;Cody Meissner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pointed this out repeatedly during the debate. He was a vocal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/health/vaccines-rfk-jr-cdc-fda.html" rel&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of CDC vaccine recommendations during the pandemic—which, almost certainly, is how he ended up on the panel now. But he’s also a well-respected pediatrician who tried to convey some practical realities to his fellow panelists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The committee ultimately balked on hep B, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/acip-tables-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-dose" rel&gt;postponing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a decision until an unspecified future date—and setting off furious speculation over what behind-the-scenes drama might have prompted the shift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WERE PANELISTS GETTING PRESSURE from the White House, which may have worried a hep B change would spark a political backlash? Were they responding to Senate HELP Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is also a physician specializing in liver disease—and who had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5508009-bill-cassidy-warning-hep-b-childhood-vaccine-delay/" rel&gt;said loudly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; he thinks changing the guidance would be a mistake?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or were some members with more anti-vax leanings unhappy that the proposal called for pushing back the first dose recommendation by only one month, when they think it should be later—and even more contingent on the identification of risk factors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any and all of those explanations are plausible, although there’s another interpretation too. Maybe some committee members zeroed in on more reliable evidence, listened to warnings from the likes of Meissner, and decided that changing the guidelines was a bad idea—or, at least, one that needed further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be a hopeful sign, because that kind of process could actually be productive. Questioning groupthink, seeking out unconventional perspectives, holding past decisions up to serious scrutiny—that’s entirely appropriate, and ultimately makes agencies like CDC more effective, not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a thoughtful, measured way to do that—one that preserves expertise and institutional memory, and allows for structured debate about genuinely complex issues. It looks like such a process would have to take place in spite of Kennedy, not because of him. And that’s not going to be easy as long as he remains in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNV2pFdWJMNFRNMjRwdHp2SVhDdlJscmpTZHJGYllVM1Jad0ZfNFNhLWk3TzBTWVAxcllhWDdzb3RvT1NIQlRSb3Nqc1A3dmUwbmpOX3Q0bnBqTGVKWjUtdTdUbi1VNVozamVtdi1FZjdLMzY0aFZDV0lmSldHUk1vaFhsVW83SzViT3FFUFdn</guid></item></channel></rss>
