&lt;p id="189181d7-60c4-4480-b2d5-e81a672fcd0f"&gt;A 47-year Swedish study published in 2026 can tell us when fitness and strength begin declining — and I’m very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed adults for almost five decades to uncover when physical decline &lt;em&gt;truly &lt;/em&gt;begins. They looked at fitness, strength and muscle endurance, and how this evolves in adulthood. Here’s everything you need to know about the mammoth study and what age your physical fitness really starts to fade out (plus, how to fix it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-531259a1-68cc-4005-8105-23c2f2f7fb5b" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-study-3"&gt;What is the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="4f3894db-c4a3-48c2-a517-a8369aa84f7b"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="08e02e9c-e700-41f6-b451-01e1864c2603"&gt;I came across the study in&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035336.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035336.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;, but it was conducted at the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.ki.se/long-term-study-reveals-physical-ability-peaks-at-age-35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://news.ki.se/long-term-study-reveals-physical-ability-peaks-at-age-35" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s rare for studies to follow people for such a long period, so this offers a unique insight into how the body changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any age, exercise boosts physical ability and slows the inevitable decline in strength and fitness as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2d35bc3a-ca34-4a5d-82f5-133c01f81ddb" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-research-mean-3"&gt;What does the research mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="519c616f-6aaa-4b04-bb01-c272db00599f"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="3cf3d433-344e-4ffb-8a78-3a79790c3afa"&gt;Interestingly, the decline occurred regardless of how well-trained people were before 35. But, post-35, decline continues gradually, says researchers, which then speeds up with advancing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “encouraging evidence” tells us that exercise can slow this process down and help increase physical capacity by 5-10%, which also slows decline in performance, but doesn’t completely prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means it’s never too late to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body"&gt;start a yoga routine&lt;/a&gt;, take up &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner"&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, or even head to your local gym to lift weights.

	&lt;div class="content-wrapper"&gt;
		
&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Last week, we broke down a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-rfk-africa-vaccines"&gt;major debacle&lt;/a&gt; unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to the trial protocols, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the &lt;a href="https://arkansasworker.com/racism-imperialism-and-medical-practices-the-tuskegee-and-guatemalan-syphilis-studies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “It is wretched.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;At the time of our writing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; had reported&lt;/a&gt; that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2021/on-background-is-common-journalism-lingo-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;no such arrangement&lt;/a&gt; — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200430225749/https://africacdc.org/about-us/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;official health agency&lt;/a&gt; of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-coming-of-age-of-the-africa-centers-for-disease-control/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 testing hub&lt;/a&gt; for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11474706/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/joint-press-release-vaccine-doses-allocated-to-9-african-countries-hardest-hit-by-mpox-surge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/ethiopia/news/who-and-africa-cdc-consolidate-ties-advance-public-health-africa" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;collaboration agreement&lt;/a&gt; to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a &lt;a href="https://ask.un.org/faq/140935" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specialized agency&lt;/a&gt; of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.&lt;/p&gt;

But the label has been enthusiastically adopted by conservative, right-leaning women across the country.

This alliance, Hotez says, is wreaking immeasurable damage to Americans’ trust in science and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rate of diseases once considered essentially under control, if not eradicated, has been climbing in recent years in the United States as vaccine rates have fallen. Measles, for example, has reached its &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2026/01/07/us-sees-highest-measles-case-count-in-decades-as-outbreaks-grow/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;highest rate of infection in decades&lt;/a&gt;, as outbreaks sicken and kill children across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activism is now a leading lethal force in the United States,” Hotez said. “And now it’s spilling over into childhood immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A movement builds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Within the crunchy moms are women who say they or their children have suffered legitimate harm from vaccines. But also flocking to the movement, and in far greater numbers, are women who question everything from the established benefits of vaccines, to how they are approved and tested, to their reported side effects, without their own personal experiences of harm resulting from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio just outside Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Homeschool lessons are given at the LoConti residence, Oct. 14, 2025, in Westlake, Ohio.

Bright says childhood vaccines made her daughter sick, pushing her towards “alternative” research on the vaccine industry. LoConti’s children never suffered such a fate, but nevertheless she’s been pulled in by Bright’s experiences, and stories from moms like her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Over several interviews, Bright and LoConti spoke passionately about the research they have conducted into everything from seed oils to colloidal silver, to double-blind placebo-controlled trials for vaccines. They laid out their reasoning for not trusting vaccines specifically, and the medical and pharmaceutical industries more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For us, it's hard to know who to trust because everything's so intertwined and there's so much money and there's so much behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's nobody asking these questions until now,” LoConti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's a sentiment echoed from the very top of the American government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perhaps the most well-known critic of vaccines, &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-autotag="1eef402e-8d6b-4ca9-ae4b-46a1674522c3" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F.

It started with carefully reading the labels on the products they had long enjoyed, from cereals, to cookies, to milk.

Let's ask the questions, let's do the research,” Bright said. “Something's not right – we don't know what it is, so let's figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti had followed a familiar path that millions of mothers like them were also going down. Concerns about their children’s food and other consumption led to concerns and skepticism about what had been injected into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the large corporations had lied to them about food and drink being healthy, they reasoned, the monolithic pharmaceutical companies were probably doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I've never been anti-vaccine'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In an attempt to understand what future changes may be coming to America's vaccine landscape, USA TODAY sat down for an exclusive interview with Kennedy at the Health and Human Services office in downtown Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In a wide-ranging conversation, Kennedy clarified his stance on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I've never been anti-vaccine," Kennedy said. "I've said that thousands and thousands of times. "My concern is that we should set proper safety tests for vaccines so that people understand, and we are able to understand, the risk profile for these products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts like Hotez consider statements like this misleading. Vaccines have already proven their worth because billions of people have taken them and side effects remain vanishingly rare, they argue. Vaccines that have been around for decades were tested originally, and have essentially been tested ever since, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's not good enough for Kennedy and his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy&lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/rfk-jr-flu-shot-vaccine/88220106007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; told USA TODAY that he questions whether he, himself, was injured by annual flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which he took until the mid 1990s and then later stopped entirely in 2005. The health secretary has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological voice disorder, that he says may have resulted from his vaccines, although the &lt;a href="https://dystonia-foundation.org/what-is-dystonia/common-misunderstandings/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has said vaccines don't cause the condition and can actually protect against some forms of dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Do I know that it was caused by my annual flu shot? I have no idea," he said. "It's a potential culprit that I cannot rule out, but I can't prove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy pledged to keep delving into the concerns of mothers like Bright and LoConti, who have lost their faith in the government to tell the truth about complicated medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"My job as HHS secretary is to tell the truth to people and then to let them to make up their own minds," he said. "And so we've implemented new policies here where we don't tell 'noble lies.' We tell the truth, whatever the impacts are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Trusting science, but only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a fundamental contradiction in the logic employed by crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to established science, and what the experts believe, the scientific community largely has their back when it comes to their views on &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/seed-oils-are-they-actually-toxic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, or trans fats, or how much screen time their kids should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But when it comes to vaccines, that support from the established scientific community all but evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and Lo Conti like to say they are simply asking questions – questions they need to ask about everything from the nutritional benefits of Oreos to the value of the measles vaccine – because nobody has ever really questioned these things before, at least not with real, honest American skepticism, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that’s not really true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Select a few “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” videos about nutrition – whether raising concerns about heavy metals in foods, or questioning the value of food dyes that are legal in the United States but banned in Europe – and it soon becomes clear that there are actually legitimate scientific concerns underpinning those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti question these things precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they can quickly and easily look up research from large, established scientific institutions that have also asked the same questions many times before. There are dozens of published scientific papers digging into the same concerns the crunchy moms have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to vaccines, however, the body of research is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Howard, an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at New York University who has written two books on the anti-vaccine movement, summed up one inherent challenge in researching vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One problem with vaccines is the good that they do is invisible, right?” Howard told USA TODAY. “No one ever comes home and says, ‘Boy, my kid didn't get measles today because of the vaccine,’ or ‘My kid didn't get polio today because of the vaccine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There exist vast troves of data showing how many lives vaccines have saved across the world, Howard said. Study after study has concluded that vaccines have helped eradicate certain diseases while controlling and mitigating others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio." data-c-credit="Andrew Dolph, Akron Beacon Journal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But for almost every legitimate study that concludes vaccines are beneficial, there are now counterparts that concerned mothers like Bright and LoConti can find online that raise concerns and fear about vaccines, Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The key difference, however, is that the vaccine-skeptical studies Bright and LoConti and other crunchy moms point to do not come from the same established sources that provide much of the fear and skepticism that drive their concerns about food and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Traditionally, scientists and doctors who have questioned vaccine safety, and even the benefits of vaccines, have quickly become pariahs. Their studies, documentaries and papers are often debunked, ridiculed and dismissed by experts on vaccines and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, Howard said, to become an anti-vaxxer, or even a vaccine-skeptic, one has to tangibly choose to believe a largely discredited subset of research that is not academically or scientifically sound, over what the vast majority of scientists have long established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s more than just skepticism, Howard said, it’s a form of wilful denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Nothing is wrong with being skeptical and there's nothing wrong with asking questions; the problem is when you don't accept the answers,” Howard said. “Anyone who now says that they are just asking questions about this sort of thing is not doing that.

			&lt;p&gt;Many people across cultures grow up hearing that cold weather makes you sick. Going outside without a coat, breathing in cold air, sleeping in a chilly room, getting caught in cold rain or snow, or simply feeling chilled are often blamed for causing colds or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief feels true to many people because illness often follows cold exposure. However, modern research shows that the connection between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cold-weather-49689"&gt;cold weather&lt;/a&gt; and illness is more nuanced than the idea that cold directly causes disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold temperatures themselves &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-winter-makes-you-more-vulnerable-to-colds-a-public-health-nurse-explains-the-science-behind-the-season-244803#"&gt;do not cause&lt;/a&gt; infections. Instead, they influence a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors that make people more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, especially &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17705968/"&gt;during the winter months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-cold-weather-cause-colds-heres-why-you-really-get-sick-in-winter"&gt;Does Cold Weather Cause Colds? Here's Why You Really Get Sick in Winter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colds and flu are caused by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, not by cold air. Viruses such as rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses spread from person to person through respiratory droplets or physical contact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33753932/"&gt;regardless of the temperature outside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg" alt="illustration of a virus" class="wp-image-189500 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Seasonal illnesses are typically caused by viruses. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD4GJySqjs/"&gt;Shutter2U/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, rates of respiratory infections consistently increase during colder seasons in many parts of the world – a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-people-get-more-colds-in-winter/"&gt;pattern that has been observed globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seasonal pattern is partly due to the way that cold temperatures and low humidity affect viruses in the environment. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2034399/"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that many respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, survive longer and remain infectious for extended periods in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7454058/"&gt;cold, dry conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air also causes tiny droplets released when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze to evaporate quickly. This creates smaller particles that stay suspended in the air longer, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/coronavirus-why-cold-winter-weather-makes-it-harder-to-fight-respiratory-infections"&gt;increasing the chance&lt;/a&gt; that others will inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, cold, dry air helps viruses persist in the environment and improves their chances of reaching another person's respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold air also &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;affects how the body defends itself&lt;/a&gt; against infection. Breathing in cold air lowers the temperature inside the nose and airways, which can trigger vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction means the narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lining of the nose and airways, this reduced blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036013232400221X#:%7E:text=The%20respiratory%20tract%20is%20mainly%20innervated%20by,nasal%20mucosa%20and%20adenoids%20%5B%2064%2C%2065%5D"&gt;can weaken local immune responses&lt;/a&gt; that normally help detect and eliminate viruses before they cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure and cold-related stress can also interfere with the normal function of the airways, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031196/#:%7E:text=For%20chronic%20patients%20with%20precarious%20respiratory%20balances,are%20both%20able%20to%20destabilize%20the%20patient"&gt;particularly in people&lt;/a&gt; with sensitive respiratory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these effects can suppress the body's first lines of defence in the nose and throat. Cold air does not create viruses, but it can make it easier for viruses to gain a foothold once exposure occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crowds and close contact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal changes in human behaviour and indoor environments &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323431"&gt;also play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Cold weather encourages people to spend more time indoors, often in close contact with others. Crowded spaces with poor ventilation allow virus-containing droplets to build up in the air, making transmission between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876"&gt;people more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During winter, reduced sunlight exposure leads to lower production of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D in the skin. Vitamin D is involved in regulating immune function, and low levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3074219/"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; weaker immune responses. Indoor heating, while essential for comfort, dries out the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air can dry the lining of the nose and throat, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8664457/"&gt;reducing the effectiveness of mucus&lt;/a&gt;. Mucus normally traps viruses and helps move them out of the airways, a process known as mucociliary clearance. When this system is impaired, viruses have an easier time infecting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold weather can be especially challenging for people with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis, which is commonly known as hay  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031646/"&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; (research that examines patterns of disease in populations) show that cold conditions can worsen symptoms and increase functional impairment in these people. This can intensify the effects of respiratory infections when they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the evidence paints a clear picture of what cold weather does and does not do. Cold temperatures are linked with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.15252/emmm.202115352"&gt;higher rates of respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;, including influenza and coronaviruses, particularly in temperate regions during winter. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151"&gt;Laboratory and environmental studies&lt;/a&gt; show that viruses survive longer and spread more easily in cold, dry air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;can also weaken immune defences&lt;/a&gt; in the nose and airways, including reduced mucus movement and decreased antiviral activity in nasal tissues. Behavioural and environmental factors typical of winter, such as indoor crowding, poor ventilation, and reduced sunlight, leading to lower vitamin D levels, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/17/3842"&gt;further increase the risk of viral spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the evidence does not support is the idea that simply being cold, such as stepping outside without a coat, directly causes a cold or flu. Instead, cold weather acts as a risk amplifier. It creates conditions that help viruses survive, spread, and overcome the body's defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this distinction has practical value. Improving indoor ventilation and maintaining adequate humidity during winter can reduce transmission risk. Supporting immune health, including maintaining adequate vitamin D levels, may also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health messages are most effective when they focus on how viruses spread through contact and respiratory droplets, rather than reinforcing the myth that cold exposure alone causes illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, cold weather and illness are linked, but not in the way many people assume. Cold temperatures do not cause infections by themselves. Instead, they shape the biological, environmental, and social conditions that allow respiratory viruses to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this complexity helps explain why colds and flu peak in winter and supports more effective strategies for prevention, while dispelling a simple but misleading belief about cold weather and sickness.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272935/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since a measles outbreak began in West Texas, and international health authorities say they will meet in April to determine if the U.S. has lost its measles-free designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the vaccine-preventable virus has regained a foothold and that the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;may soon follow Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in losing the achievement of having eliminated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reevaluation is largely symbolic and hinges on whether a single measles chain has spread uninterrupted within the U.S. for at least 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists around the country are investigating whether the now-ended Texas outbreak is linked to active ones in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina. But doctors and scientists say the U.S. — and North America overall — has a measles problem, regardless of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really a question of semantics,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, a Wisconsin family physician who helped certify the U.S. was measles-free in 2000. “The bottom line is the conditions are sufficient to allow this many cases to occur. And that gets back to de-emphasizing a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the most since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and nearly 50 separate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem has been years in the making, as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;fewer kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get routine vaccines due to parental waivers, health care access issues and rampant disinformation. More recently, Trump administration health officials have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-safety-mmr-autism-rfk-hepatitis-20d3122d7a9a339cd8447a347bd49928"&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;sown doubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the established safety of vaccines at an unprecedented level while also &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;defunding local efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to improve vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing that we can do is to make sure the people who aren’t vaccinated get vaccinated,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center. “We have not issued a clear enough message about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said Thursday that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has consistently emphasized vaccines as the best way to prevent measles, adding that the CDC is responding to outbreaks and working to increase vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the department said it doesn’t have evidence that a single chain of measles has spread for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Measles finds the unv&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;accinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little room for error in trying to stop measles. The virus is one of the most contagious, infecting 9 out of every 10 unvaccinated people exposed. Community-level protection takes a 95% vaccination rate. The current rate nationally is 92.5%, according to CDC data, but many communities fall far below that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in Texas’ first known case developed the telltale rash on Jan. 20, 2025, according to state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the outbreak exploded. Officially, 762 people fell ill, most of them in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;rural Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and two children died. Many more got sick and were never diagnosed: 182 potential measles cases among children in Gaines County went unconfirmed in March 2025 alone, state health officials said, a possible undercount of 44% in that county.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Such data gaps are common, though, making it especially hard to track outbreaks. Many people living in communities where the virus is spreading face health care barriers and distrust the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing so many cases is also expensive, said behavioral scientist Noel Brewer, who chairs the U.S. committee that will finalize the data for international health officials. Research shows &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-health-departments-723baa2b92828b04092475f4763585a6"&gt;a single measles case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cost public health departments &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data on measles is still among the best worldwide, Brewer said, but “the U.S. has changed its investment in public health, so we’re less able to do the case tracking that we used to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic sequencing can fill some gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always enough to say the outbreaks are connected. Genetically, the measles virus doesn’t change as often as, say, flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within an outbreak, everybody is going to look the same,” said Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question may then be how PAHO experts will navigate final data gaps, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a Utah physician and longtime CDC consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“My best guess is we will lose elimination status,” Pavia said. “The case for this not being continuous transmission is tenuous, and I think they are likely to err on the side of declaring it a loss of elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have confirmed the same measles strain in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, Canada, Mexico and several other North American countries, said Sebastian Oliel, a spokesperson for the Pan American Health Organization, which will make the final decision on U.S. measles elimination at an April 13 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliel said when there is a case of unknown origin in a country with ongoing local spread, “the most conservative approach is to consider the case part of the existing national transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Mexico also up for review&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO will review Mexico’s measles-free status alongside the U.S., Oliel said. That country’s largest outbreak has roots in Texas. It started when an 8-year-old boy from Chihuahua state got sick after visiting family in Seminole, Texas. Since last February, 6,000 people have gotten sick in Mexico, and 21 have died in Chihuahua state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under PAHO’s definition of elimination, borders matter. If, for example, the chain of measles that started in the U.S. spread to Mexico and then returned to the U.S. anew, it would be considered a new chain, experts said. Still, many experts call that standard outdated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that measles found ample fertile ground in the U.S. in 2025, infiltrating &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-school-attendance-absences-0384199ace95b4088f60864ce9ec8315"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and day cares, churches, hospital waiting rooms and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-new-mexico-detention-facility-migrants-outbreak-c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea"&gt;a detention center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. New Mexico logged 100 cases and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299"&gt;one adult died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Kansas officials spent seven months trying to control an outbreak that sickened nearly 90 people across 10 counties. Ohio confirmed 40 cases. Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin each had 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than 800 people have gotten sick across Utah, Arizona and South Carolina since late summer, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;with no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2025 was the year of measles,” Brewer said. “Will 2026 be the year of rising or falling measles cases? Does it get worse or does it get better? No one knows the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

across 27 U.S. states, including California, according to federal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus — called &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; — is considered an “&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25152-candida-auris"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emerging infectious disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” as health care providers have seen an increase in cases since 2019, Cleveland Clinic experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 20, California had reported 1, 524 cases of the fungal infection in 2025, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/251634"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt;

is a type of &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/prevention/index.html"&gt;yeast infection that spreads rapidly&lt;/a&gt; among sick patients in health care facilities, federal health experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus can cause everything from skin infections to life-threatening bloodstream infections, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to treat as it adapts to drugs designed to kill it, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2016 to 2022, cases of the fungal infection resulted in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/7/23-0540_article"&gt;mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of 34%, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How do people get deadly fungal infection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. auris usually affects patients with severe underlying medical conditions and people with invasive medical devices such as breathing tubes, feeding tubes and catheters, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection spreads through surfaces and objects and can live on a patient’s skin or body sites even if they don’t have symptoms, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="12" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and visitors aren’t at risk of becoming infected, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What are symptoms of Candida auris?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While symptoms of &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called ticking biological clock has been framed largely as a concern for women. We talk about egg freezing, ovarian reserve, and the ticking timeline of maternal fertility. Meanwhile, the male timeline has often been treated as a flat line — men, the story goes, can father children well into their twilight years with little consequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is it that simple, though? For one, we know that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10909733/"&gt;children of older fathers face higher statistical risks&lt;/a&gt; for neurodevelopmental disorders, stillbirth, and metabolic issues. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the British Andrology Society, and the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society have advised that the upper limit for sperm donors for assisted conception should be 40 years old as a precautionary measure, “so that the potential hazards related to aging are diminished” on the basis of increased risk of genetic abnormalities in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mechanism, however, has remained a black box. Is it just about accumulating DNA mutations and epigenetics, or is there something else hitching a ride into the egg?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;suggests the answer lies in a hidden world of genetic instructions that science has largely missed. By peeling back the layers of sperm biology, researchers have discovered a molecular “aging cliff” — a dramatic, sudden shift in the RNA profile of sperm that occurs in mid-life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like finding a molecular clock that ticks with age in both mice and humans, suggesting a fundamental, conserved molecular signature of sperm aging,” says Qi Chen, MD, PhD, associate professor of urology and human genetics at U of U Health and one of the senior authors of the research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, though by no means definitive, represent a fundamental rethinking of what fathers pass down to their children, and how the aging process rewrites the code of life before conception even happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decoding-sperm-degradation"&gt;Decoding Sperm Degradation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand this discovery, you have to understand why we missed it for so long. For years, scientists focused on the DNA package inside the sperm head. We knew that, as men age, this DNA could become fragmented. But sperm also carry RNA, a molecule usually tasked with carrying out DNA’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem was that standard sequencing tools couldn’t see the whole picture. Sperm RNAs are often heavily modified chemically, which makes them invisible to traditional sequencing machines, almost like writing a message in invisible ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;

            &lt;div class="zme-signup-container" id="zme-main-container"&gt;
                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Thank you! One more thing...&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;To solve this, Chen’s team utilized a technique they developed called PANDORA-seq. This method treats the RNA with enzymes that remove those chemical disguises, allowing the sequencer to read previously “unsequencable” molecules. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was a massive, previously hidden population of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), specifically those derived from transfer RNA (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA (rsRNAs)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These aren’t junk; they are regulatory elements that can control gene expression in the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied this “night vision” goggles approach to mouse sperm, the results were startling. They didn’t see a slow, linear decline. Instead, they saw a precipitous drop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 50 and 70 weeks of age in mice — roughly equivalent to mid-life in humans — the sperm RNA profile underwent a radical transformation. The researchers call it an “aging cliff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe this progressive length shift accumulates quietly, until it triggers the ‘cliff’ change at mid-life,” Chen suggests&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-paradox-of-length"&gt;The Paradox of Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most surprising aspect of this new data contradicts almost everything we thought we knew about aging and cellular decay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, when biological molecules age, they break down. DNA fragments, proteins degrade, and so on. You would expect the RNA in older sperm to be shorter, chopped up by the wear and tear of time. But the molecular clock in sperm runs backward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as the mice aged, specific ribosomal RNAs (rsRNAs) in the sperm head actually became &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt;. The ratio shifted: the abundance of longer RNA fragments increased, while the shorter ones decreased. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first glance, this finding seems counterintuitive,” Chen says. “For decades, we have known that as sperm age, their DNA becomes more fragmented and broken. One might expect RNA to follow this pattern. Instead, we found the opposite: specific sperm RNAs actually become longer with age”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? The study suggests that the machinery responsible for chopping these RNAs into precise, functional sizes might be getting “rusty.” The enzymes that process these molecules may lose efficiency due to oxidative stress, leaving the RNAs unprocessed and overly long.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a quirk of mouse biology. The team validated these findings in two human cohorts. They looked at sperm samples from the same donors collected years apart and found the exact same phenomenon: the rsRNAs in the sperm heads of older men were consistently longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Validating this finding from mice to humans was really exciting,” says Kenneth Aston, PhD, director of the Andrology &amp;amp; IVF Lab at the University of Utah and co-senior author on the paper. “Our sperm bank resources at the University of Utah made this cross-species validation possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-signal-in-the-noise"&gt;The Signal in the Noise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One reason this “aging cliff” remained elusive for so long is that sperm are complex structures. They have a head, which contains the genetic payload, and a long tail packed with mitochondria to power their swim to the egg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers sequenced whole sperm in the past, the RNA from the tail drowned out the signal from the head. Yet by physically separating the sperm heads and sequencing them in isolation, the team clarified the signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This rsRNA length shift was a unique signal, specific to the sperm heads. It was obscured by the ‘noisier’ profile of the whole sperm,” explains co-corresponding author Tong Zhou, PhD, associate professor of physiology and cell biology in the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. “Sequencing the sperm head sample is what made this discovery possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction is crucial because it is the sperm head that fuses with the egg and delivers the genetic material. The finding that these shifted RNAs are locked inside the nucleus suggests they are poised to influence the embryo immediately after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even though the sperm heads were stripped of their tails (and thus their main power plants), the researchers still found traces of mitochondrial RNA inside the head. These mitochondrial RNAs mirrored the aging patterns of the genomic RNAs, suggesting a coordinated system where the sperm nucleus and mitochondria communicate about the aging state of the cell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hacking-the-embryo"&gt;Hacking the Embryo&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question, of course, is: “So what?” Does it matter if a father’s sperm carries slightly longer bits of RNA?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers created a synthetic “cocktail” of RNAs that mimicked the profile of an older father — high in long rsRNAs, low in short ones. They injected this “old RNA” cocktail into mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a model for the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results provided a potential mechanism for the health issues seen in children of older fathers. The “old” RNA cocktail reprogrammed the stem cells. It triggered significant changes in gene expression, specifically ramping up pathways involved in metabolism and turning on genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies show that advanced paternal age is l&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443922000187"&gt;inked to metabolic disorders and behavioral anomalies&lt;/a&gt; in offspring. This study provides a molecular smoking gun: the “old” sperm RNA alone was enough to induce these changes in cellular programming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This discovery, made possible by PANDORA-seq, could lay the groundwork for future diagnostics to help guide informed reproductive decisions and improve fertility outcomes,” says James M. Hotaling, MD, Chief Innovation Officer at University of Utah Health and an author on the study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fertility testing for men is fairly rudimentary relative to the requirements mandated by the new findings. Clinics count sperm, check if they are swimming, and look at their shape. But at the moment, they rarely look under the hood at the molecular instructions they carry. This research suggests that in the future, men might screen their “sperm RNA age” to understand the risks they might pass on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is now hunting for the specific enzymes that control this RNA processing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can understand the enzymes driving this shift, they could become actionable targets for interventions to potentially improve sperm quality in aging males,” Chen says. “Stay tuned”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s plan to blame autism on women using acetaminophen (a.k.a. Tylenol) during pregnancy is getting more pushback from actual scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past weekend, researchers in Europe published a review of the scientific evidence on autism and acetaminophen. After accounting for known biases in past studies, they failed to find a connection between maternal acetaminophen use and a greater risk of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions in children. The findings indicate that women can continue to safely take the over-the-counter pain and fever medication as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Current evidence does not indicate a clinically important increase in the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or intellectual disability in children of pregnant individuals who use paracetamol as directed, supporting existing recommendations on its safety,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynecology, &amp;amp; Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No causative link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last September, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a supposed breakthrough: they found evidence of a potential link between autism and acetaminophen during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though RFK Jr. and other White House officials were somewhat more cautious in their tone, noting that further research would be needed to confirm a causative relationship, Trump was not. At the press conference announcing the findings, he repeatedly told women to immediately stop using acetaminophen. Despite the lack of a smoking gun, the administration also stated it would take regulatory action, such as adding a warning label to acetaminophen products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time, however, rebuffed the administration’s claims. While some studies have suggested a possible link, many others haven’t, including studies explicitly designed to address limitations of observational research. Following Trump’s announcement, the UK and many other countries have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000663086"&gt;continued to endorse&lt;/a&gt; the use of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol in much of the world) during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is the only widely recommended painkiller for pregnant women, since other drugs can have serious side effects, including a &lt;a href="https://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/September2022/Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory%20drugs-NSAIDs-avoid-use%20in-pregnancy.html#:~:text=NSAID%20use%20in%20early%20pregnancy,some%20cases%2C%20neonatal%20renal%20impairment."&gt;higher risk of miscarriages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and elsewhere analyzed data from 43 high-quality studies. Some of these studies compared the outcomes of siblings born to the same mother who reported using acetaminophen during one pregnancy but not the other. Since siblings share many genetic and environmental factors in common, these studies can better account for potential noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, when the researchers included sibling studies in their analysis, they found no significant link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and a greater risk of children developing autism, intellectual disability, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also failed to find a link when they only included studies judged to be at low risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself,” said study author Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at City St George’s, University of London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2026/january2/taking-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-does-not-increase-risk-of-autism-adhd-or-intellectual-disabilities"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings echo those of a similar review &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/science-keeps-dismantling-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000683647"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last November, which also failed to find convincing evidence of a causative link between acetaminophen and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The major takeaway&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though no drug should be used more than needed, the authors are unequivocal about the implications of their research: Pregnant women shouldn’t be overly stressed about using acetaminophen/paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The message is clear—paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,” Khalil said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that this study, or any other independent research, will deter the Trump administration from moving forward with its attempt to scapegoat Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-makes-bizarre-connection-between-circumcision-tylenol-and-autism-2000670971"&gt;White House Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; discussing the report in early October, RFK Jr. acknowledged that the government did not have proof that acetaminophen can cause autism. Immediately after, however, he stated, “We’re doing the studies to make the proof.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s gnasty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scourge of mosquitoes has been terrorizing residents of El Segundo for the past two months — and the situation is only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say they are covered in bites and welts despite trying to eliminate the infestation, &lt;a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/el-segundo-mosquito-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fox 11 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many describe the infestation as overwhelming, saying mosquitoes have overrun yards and made their way inside homes, disrupting sleep and daily routines. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents in El Segundo say they have been locked in a relentless fight against mosquitoes for nearly two months, swatting and spraying at all hours of the day and night, with little sign of improvement. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Locals have been swatting and spraying for months, sometimes for hours at a time. But the mosquitoes continue to overrun their yards and homes, and are making it hard to carry out daily routines or even sleep at night, they said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sounds are constant,” resident Truman Hedding told Fox 11, referring to the repeated zap of electric mosquito swatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get them, it’s the best, most satisfying thing in the world — but it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say the mosquito surge began nearly two months ago and has only intensified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are covered in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/health/ivermectin-could-be-the-key-to-curbing-malaria/"&gt;mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt; every night,” Samantha Hedding told Fox 11. “My kids have welts. We’re late to school because we’re up until 4 or 5 in the morning killing mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;She said the insects are getting inside homes despite residents taking extreme precautions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are in our house. Every door is locked, every window is sealed,” Hedding said. “If a door opens, we all freak out. The weather has been beautiful, but we can’t enjoy it. We can’t open our windows or doors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city said it has been working to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“El Segundo is working aggressively with the City of Los Angeles and Vector Control to find the sources of this &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/lifestyle/mosquitoes-takes-over-entire-plane/"&gt;massive infestation&lt;/a&gt;,” El Segundo Mayor Chris Pimentel told Fox 11. “We are making progress in the northern part of the outbreak and are focused on the six blocks that are still under siege.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We’ve got great news for everyone who’s ever been kept awake until the wee hours of the morning by a family member or housemate screaming obscenities at their monitor while playing video games. Your lectures about how playing video games for so long isn’t healthy now have new scientific justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in the journal Nutrition found an association between gaming more than 10 hours a week and poor diet quality, higher body mass, and lower sleep quality. The research suggests that playing video games isn’t the main problem, but overdoing the amount of time dedicated to it, according to Mario Siervo, a co-author of the study from the Curtin School of Population Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Hardcore gaming might impact health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep and body weight,” he said in a Curtin University &lt;a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/news/media-release/study-reveals-how-many-hours-of-video-games-per-week-might-be-too-many/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Siervo and his coworkers worked with over 300 students from Australian universities who self-reported how much time they spent gaming per week. Based on this information, the team organized them into three categories—low gamers (0 to 5 hours of gaming per week), moderate gamers (5 to 10 hours per week), and high gamers (more than 10 hours per week).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Low and moderate gamers described similar health statuses, which were significantly worse for high gamers. For example, the researchers noted lower diet quality for high gamers. Heavy gamers were more likely to be obese, with a median BMI of 26.3. By comparison, low and moderate gamers had healthier averages of 22.2 and 22.8, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity and other lifestyle factors,” Siervo explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Poor sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to argue against your household gamer logging 10 hours a week, sleep quality might be your strongest case. In the study, all three categories reported poor sleep quality overall, though moderate and high gamers had lower scores than low gamers. The study found an important association between gaming hours and sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This study doesn’t prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors,” Siervo clarified. “Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly and staying active.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which he added: “Because university habits often follow people into adulthood, healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But new research suggests that there could be a specific culprit to blame: certain preservatives—and these show up in more foods than just processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The BMJ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is opening up more questions about associations between processed foods and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA; Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;; Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group &lt;/a&gt;and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at diet and health data from more than 105,000 people between 2009 and 2023. On the dietary front, researchers specifically looked at the impact of 17 different preservatives on a range of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found there wasn’t a link between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; types of preservatives and a higher risk of cancer, they found clear associations between some preservatives and specific types of cancer. Those included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium sorbate and breast cancer, overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium metabisulfite and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium nitrite and prostate cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium nitrate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetic acid and overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium erythorbate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of preservatives (11 out of 17) were not linked with a higher risk of cancer. So, what’s behind this and, more importantly, what should you take away from the latest research? Here’s what the data found, plus what experts suggest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods do these preservatives show up in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get surprising. While plenty of people were exposed to these preservatives through processed meats, there were other, less obvious sources. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might these preservatives be linked to cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found a link between certain preservatives and cancer, they didn’t dive into why this association exists. Still, this is “likely to be a combination of factors,” including the composition of the foods these preservatives are used in, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik points out that the exact way these preservatives impact the body and affect cancer risk isn’t well known. “Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166445X22002065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that preservatives like nitrates and nitrites change the immune environment and can change the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10915207/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in genetic alterations of cells,” he says. “But there’s a lot more work to better understand the exact relationship of these preservatives and the development of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center—James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, agrees, and says it’s important not to panic. "We cannot say that the preservatives caused the cancer—there may be many other factors that led to that diagnosis,” she says. But in addition to impacting the gut bacteria, Champion points out that some preservatives may promote inflammation in the body. (Inflammation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious diseases, including cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for why some of these preservatives were linked to cancer and others weren’t, Champion says it may come down to their chemical structure and how our bodies metabolize preservatives. “Some are broken down and eliminated easily, while others may undergo chemical changes in the body that could be more problematic,” Champion says. “The bottom line is that some preservatives appear more concerning than others based on this research, which is actually helpful information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important to remember that the study didn’t find that foods that contained these preservatives &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; cancer. “We have to remember correlation does not always equal causation,” says Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “Preservatives are most abundant in foods that have excess added sugar, saturated fat, and other ingredients that can drive up cancer risk,” she says. Moskovitz also points out that it’s possible that people who eat a lot of foods with preservatives may not be eating a sufficient amount of cancer-fighting foods, like fresh fruit, veggies, and other antioxidant-rich, plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reason, the study’s authors call for more investigation into the link. “These findings may have important public health implications given the ubiquitous use of these additives in a wide range of foods and beverages,” they wrote in the study. They also noted that the findings present “new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to entirely avoid preservatives in food, but you can make a conscious decision to minimize how much preservatives you take in, points out Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;. “In general, a lot of the foods that [preservatives] are added to are not very nutrient-dense,” she says. “Regardless of the specific preservative, you’re not getting much in the way of protective benefits from those foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik agrees. “We really need to think carefully about what we order, what we eat,” he says. That includes focusing on shopping the outer sections of the grocery store first (these tend to feature fresh produce, dairy, and meats), before making your way to the center aisles. “These are foods that are not necessarily processed to last for long periods of time,” Dr. Bilchik says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just another reason to encourage people to eat more minimally-processed foods that have a lot of nutrients that have been shown to help protect against cancer,” Cording says. “Does that mean you can’t enjoy the occasional deli sandwich or ketchup on your burger with a glass of wine? Absolutely not,” Moskovitz says. “Not only is that unrealistic, but unnecessary if you have an otherwise healthy lifestyle and balanced diet. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Bilchik notes that there’s more to cancer risk than preservatives, making this just one part of cancer prevention. “Genetic factors are certainly one part, and we cannot control those,” he says. “In terms of lifestyle, exercise, avoiding smoking, stress reduction...there are so many other factors involved in cancer reduction other than what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOWEZIeVZ6dnVWdTF0dkt5ZFEwRkktc1B6V1ZhbE5IU1EwVHNtb2dQSE80SkZsOVFnNDFwYlo5Y095WVpWeVRwQ24yWUNqZjFWazdSLWtxenhZdEYzYVUza013bENpVWVWSmdBcWswOTdZTm5PZ3U5NHJKbVF3TjJJeldYcjM4TWV0aC1Z</guid></item><item><title>增强免疫系统无效的5种方法（浪费$ 100s ） -金钱谈话新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/ways-to-boost-your-immune-system-that-dont-work-and-waste-s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:29:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeElLLVVRZWsxcWRsdWpxbDhOano0VkRwYXc4aElLQ1N3aXZ3TTVpQW5Ob1RuaUlBQTUzMklEem5odFBCdTZzZTkyNzdVSTNEVjN6WVI3VVNWVGg3T2tMbjdINjB1dlh6QTV0NXQxLUZTOUQ2cGlOYnZtVUhfNGtERHFXeUtpcFhzMXJVMER5Vm5XZl9vZmc</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情创纪录的一年。这可能是致命卷土重来的开始- KSL新闻</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51435585/us-had-record-breaking-year-for-measles-it-may-be-the-start-of-a-deadly-comeback</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Tuesday marks one year since a measles outbreak started in west Texas, and there have been new cases in the United States each week since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas reported more than 760 cases — and the deaths of two children – before declaring the outbreak over in August. It was the largest outbreak the US had seen in decades, and since then, other large outbreaks — one in the upstate region of South Carolina and another on the border of Utah and Arizona — have amassed hundreds of cases each and continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of 2026 have been some of the worst yet, with exposures reported at schools, churches, restaurants, shops, airports and more. The continuous spread of measles over the past year leaves the US at risk of losing elimination status, which the country has held since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is startling, because just a few years ago, measles was very rare in the United States," said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, ​an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we're seeing in a single week what we might have seen in an average year," she said. "There's been a real shift in the presence of this preventable disease in our life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that balance can shift back depends on how quickly the US can improve vaccination coverage, experts say – which, in many ways, has become an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, which is nearly as many as the average annual total in those 25 years since elimination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of cases — more than 95% — have been in people who had not been vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear that the situation may have to get much worse before it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's particularly devastating, they say, because the illnesses and deaths they foresee are almost entirely preventable with the help of vaccines — but lagging coverage has left many vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear yet whether the US will maintain its measles elimination status. In April, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, will formally make the determination. The decision will require a detailed review of epidemiological and laboratory evidence to understand patterns of measles spread over the past year — including whether more recent outbreaks are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts say that formally losing measles elimination status would be a symptom of more deeply rooted issues, particularly challenges with vaccination that have been building for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's face it, whether we lose elimination status or not in spring, is our public health system actually doing well?" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who resigned in protest last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles elimination is a vital sign of our public health system. That public health system is blue in the ICU," he said. "I don't need to check its pulse to know [it's not doing well]. I know the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record share of U.S. kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination last school year, according to data from the CDC, marking the fifth year in a row that coverage with the MMR vaccine was below the federal target of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that the increase in vaccine exemptions may be "due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy." A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a "medical" reason to request an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines are a victim of their own success. It's not just that we eliminated measles. I think we eliminated the memory of measles," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit remembers speaking with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC557162/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maurice Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist who developed the MMR vaccine and dozens of others, just months before Hilleman's death in 2005. Measles cases had reached a record low in 2004 but were starting to trend up again, just a few years after the US had achieved elimination following a long and hard-fought battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I asked him, 'Do you think that we can educate people about the importance of the vaccine, about the serious nature of this disease, or does the virus have to come back?" Offit said. He said there was a tear in his eye when he replied that the virus was going to have to come back to teach that lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was an enormous defeat for him," Offit said. "It's an enormous defeat for us to once again see children be exposed to something that could kill them — and did kill them – in this country, when that was completely unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems more and more that the virus isn't necessarily doing that, educating either, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three deaths from measles last year — as many as there had been over the past 25 years combined — yet it's been a struggle to increase vaccination rates, even in communities that experienced outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina health department has offered a mobile vaccination clinic since the early weeks of the outbreak in the upstate region of the state, but state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell has said that uptake has been "disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks tend to occur in under-vaccinated pockets of the U.S., often in tight-knit communities, such as those with certain religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

But interpreting what those markers mean for an individual remains a major challenge, and different labs vary in their methodology, leading to differing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are still in the infancy of understanding how to interpret them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Crunch time: are freeze-dried fruit and veg actually healthy to eat or just chips in a different form? | Antiviral","elementId":"bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/freeze-dried-fruit-veg-healthy-food-nutrition-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a gut microbiome test is ordered by a specialist doctor or accredited dietitian with a clear clinical reason, sent to a reputable lab, and interpreted by someone trained to make sense of the results, it can be genuinely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong recently saw a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and rectal bleeding who had already undergone standard medical tests. The microbiome results, in that case, helped confirm dietary issues and guide further treatment once simple and important issues had been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But these cases are the exception, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy mix of organisms in one person could be problematic in another; “The same organism has different species and acts differently in different individuals,” Leong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It means for the vast majority of people who order these tests online, and who may be curious about their gut health or wondering about their symptoms or foods to avoid, “there are no translatable benefits” to ordering a test, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Temporary dietary changes, medications or illness could all affect the results, and what those results actually mean for an individual’s health outcomes isn’t well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="false-alarms-can-cause-distress" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;False alarms can cause distress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of Leong’s patients who took a commercial home test came to him panicking about bowel cancer after the report suggested she had certain inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong said a colonoscopy remains the definitive test to investigate bowel polyps and cancers. The free home bowel screening test issued by the Australian government, which looks for hidden blood in stool, is an evidence-based way to detect early warning signs of bowel cancer and may prompt follow-up testing, including a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And while some home gut microbiome tests claim to offer insights into metabolism or inflammation, “very few experts can use these results appropriately at present,” Leong said, including gastroenterologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is because clinicians aren’t trained to interpret the complex outputs the tests generate, the science is still developing, and there aren’t clear guidelines on what to do with the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-illusion-of-control" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;The illusion of control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At-home microbiome tests are spruiked by online influencers as a way of empowering people who want more insights into their health.

ROACH: I am an 80-year-old female on Eliquis who has many bruises on her legs that do not go away. Is there a remedy for this situation? -- R.D.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5Y5EU4HUBGYBERYHSROISNVMU"&gt;ANSWER: Eliquis is an anticoagulant; it reduces the body’s ability to make blood clots by affecting clotting factors. We are all constantly breaking small blood vessels, but in people in their 80s, blood vessels are a bit more fragile and are prone to break with minor trauma. Even people who aren’t on anticoagulants can develop bruising on their arms or legs. But when a person is on apixaban (Eliquis) or a similar drug, the anticoagulant is most likely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TWJ7BOIGYBA5ZKDPI5YLAESYNE"&gt;Some nutrients that are found in fruits and vegetables can help the blood vessels stay stronger, so a healthy diet is probably your best bet to reduce bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GDUDW24QKBFYZIGOSYVWYMBOIE"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: How is “wet brain” (or Wernicke encephalopathy, WE) diagnosed? My son has been in the hospital, a rehab facility, and now an assisted living facility. Is there hope that he may walk again? He does not have any motivation and stays in bed most days playing on his phone. He hates being at a retirement home because he is 45, but he can’t take care of himself. He has lost his family and career because of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5244BEWNMFFGBGRDVJ5EDGGCW4"&gt;The physical therapist told me that he has wet brain. The doctor said it is a neuropathy and that his brain is shrinking. Please advise; we are seeking help for him to get better and out on his own. -- M.L.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKJZAZR2NZCBVFWR3VBXVK3A4I"&gt;ANSWER: WE is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1). (I had never heard the term “wet brain” to describe this illness, but I see it used sometimes. When I hear “wet brain,” I think of hydrocephalus, a condition of too much fluid in the brain, but this is clearly not what you are asking about.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L2JPZYPTGRAARAOV7G5ZTFL4UQ"&gt;Over 90% of cases of WE are associated with alcohol use. People with chronic, heavy alcohol use often do not get adequate thiamine from food, and in addition, alcohol can affect the absorption of thiamine and its storage in the liver. It is likely that there are genetic variants of metabolic enzymes that predispose a person to getting WE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MXLR5O5BZBB2DH3F7QHL7CZEY4"&gt;There are three classic findings in WE. The first is encephalopathy, which is characterized by disorientation, a poor attention span, and general indifference. Expert exams reveal the second issue: paralysis of certain eye muscles. Gait abnormalities are the third set of classic findings, with a gait where the feet are wide apart, consisting of slow steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VMQVSVD7HRCKHLTRVCHOXNVOKQ"&gt;Both the eye movement and gait disorders are a type of neuropathy caused by low thiamine. His doctor mentions shrinking of the brain (“atrophy”), which is common in WE but not at all specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6WBLGKHLFGCLGZ6RDNLEOAI7A"&gt;A late manifestation of the encephalopathy is a condition called Korsakoff syndrome, in which there is profound amnesia. Some people develop confabulation -- making up stories that are completely untrue but make sense in the context of a conversation. It is thought that people with Korsakoff syndrome are unaware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TDIEMCJW5VCBZN5JYRG2LKAIYE"&gt;I wish I had better news for your son on the possibility of recovery, as only rapid and immediate administration of thiamine is effective at resolving symptoms.

At a time when autism was little known or understood, in 1962 he co-founded the UK’s leading autistic charity. As its first chair, he was the driving force in publicising the condition and raising funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He helped set up the world’s first autism-specific school in 1965 and the first residential community for autistic adults in 1974. As one of a group of lawyers, he campaigned for the Education (Handicapped Children) Act in 1970, which gave all children, regardless of disability, the right to an education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron was impelled into activism by the plight of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/17/autism-education-saskia-baron-brother" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his son Timothy&lt;/a&gt;. Born in 1956, as a toddler Timothy had little to no speech and an aloofness that set him apart from other children as well as behavioural problems. One paediatrician whom Baron saw was familiar with the work of the American doctor Leo Kanner and thought Timothy had a condition that was virtually unknown in the UK: autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kanner had described “classic autistic syndrome” in 1943, saying it was characterised by “a powerful desire for aloneness and sameness” a description that seemed to chime with Timothy’s behaviour. However, with zero provision for such children apart from psychiatric institutions, the outlook seemed bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron instinctively knew his son had a different way of looking at the world from other people and could not make sense of things or communicate what he needed. He was adamant that Timothy did not have a medical illness and nor was he “ineducable” as some doctors said. He was convinced that in the right educational setting Timothy could learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wanting to find out about autism, Baron joined the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children (the name for Mencap at the time). At a conference in 1961 he met other parents including fortuitously a young psychiatrist, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/22/lorna-wing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Lorna Wing&lt;/a&gt;, who was familiar with Kanner’s work and also had an autistic child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Keen to create an autism-specific charity, in January 1962, Baron, Wing and several other parents of autistic children met up for the first time. They initially called it the “Society for Psychotic Children” because so few in the UK understood the word “autism”, but Baron persuaded them it should be the National Society for Autistic Children. Later it became clear that autism does not stop at childhood and the society broadened its scope, changing its name in 1975 to the &lt;a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; (NAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the early 1960s Baron and Wing heard of a talented Montessori teacher, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sybil Elgar&lt;/a&gt;, who was teaching young children with learning disabilities in her home and had developed a structured approach to help them learn. They persuaded her to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron found premises in Ealing, west London, and in 1965 what would become known as the Sybil Elgar school opened with Timothy and Wing’s daughter, Susan, as two of its first pupils. Through Baron’s networking and articles in the media, public awareness of autism was growing, helped considerably one afternoon by a visit to the school by the Beatles, and John Lennon writing them a cheque for £1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9537196b-a270-4b97-9a80-5b97686d323e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Michael Baron at Crummock Water, near Buttermere, 2017. Previously he had campaigned against the poor disposal of nuclear waste in the Lake District.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Saskia Baron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Timothy spent his secondary school years in a boarding school in Northern Ireland, and as he approached 18, Baron worried about his future and that of other autistic adults who needed lifelong support. He discovered a large property for sale near Brent Knoll in Somerset and through the NAS raised funds, arranged its purchase and converted the house to have suitable accommodation for 21 residents. In 1974, &lt;a href="https://media.autism.org.uk/m/648d9a434534f858/original/First-Year-At-Somerset-Court.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Somerset Court&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s first autism-specific residential community opened, with Elgar as its first principal. Timothy was one of the first residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the decades, as autism was understood as a spectrum and an ever-wider number of people were diagnosed with it, Baron was concerned that vulnerable people like his son might get lost as NAS and society at large focused on the needs of higher-functioning autistic people. As Timothy and his contemporaries aged, it opened his eyes to the health and welfare needs of older severely autistic adults. In his 80s and 90s Baron campaigned for more learning disability nurses in the NHS and a wider understanding of welfare deputies, who could support disabled people if their family members were no longer around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1980 Baron was made an MBE for his services to autism. Speaking about him and his contemporaries in the 60s, Carol Povey, a former director of the Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt; at NAS, said: “That first generation of parents were formidable – a force of nature. They were admirable, fierce and so skilled at making change happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Born in Willesden, north-west London, Michael was the second son of Herbert, a lawyer, and Lily (nee Moses), a doctor. As well as his brother, Ronald, he had a younger sister, Margaret. From Westminster school, in 1948 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After graduating in 1951, Baron took the Law Society exams, became a solicitor in his father’s firm, and then set up his own offices in Twickenham, south-west London. He met Mie Wadsted, a Danish student who had come to London to improve her English, and they married in 1956. They had Timothy shortly afterwards, followed by two girls, Joanna and Saskia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baron’s marriage ended in divorce in 1977, and three years later he married Hetty Thieme, a social worker. He sold his London firm in 1990 and the couple fulfilled a dream to move to the Lake District. There he became involved in a campaign to prevent the poor disposal of nuclear waste and took a passionate interest in local fauna such as bats and red squirrels. He had enjoyed literature and poetry all his life and helped to set up the literary festival &lt;a href="https://www.wordsbythewaterkeswick.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Words by the Water&lt;/a&gt; in Keswick, Cumbria. Towards the end of his life, in 2023, he took huge pride in seeing the publication of his poetry anthology &lt;a href="https://palewellpress.co.uk/bookstore/environment/ging/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Gingko Tree and Other Poems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2012 Hetty died and Baron moved back to London, living latterly with &lt;a href="https://communitylivingmagazine.com/exploring-puzzle-autism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his daughter Saskia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jan/15/familyandrelationships.features102" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;documentary film-maker&lt;/a&gt;, who in 2003 made &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/saskiabaron/20748434" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Autism Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His other daughter, Joanna, died in 2025.

&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus on the biological mechanisms underpinning &lt;strong&gt;sunburn&lt;/strong&gt; has remained largely unchanged for decades. The prevailing view posited that &lt;strong&gt;ultraviolet (UV) radiation&lt;/strong&gt; induces DNA mutations in skin cells, triggering inflammatory responses and initiating cell death to prevent carcinogenesis. This framework has shaped dermatological education, cancer research funding priorities, and public health messaging across high-UV index regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identified a different primary trigger. Through controlled experiments involving both murine and human epidermal models, the study demonstrated that the &lt;strong&gt;initial cellular response to UVB exposure is governed by RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt;, not DNA lesions. This distinction alters the molecular understanding of &lt;strong&gt;cutaneous inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; and raises new questions about the mechanisms of UV-induced cell signaling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have attracted growing attention from &lt;strong&gt;biomedical regulatory agencies&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;skin disease researchers&lt;/strong&gt; exploring alternative models of &lt;strong&gt;UV damage signaling&lt;/strong&gt;. In mouse models lacking the ZAK alpha kinase gene, a key regulator in ribosomal stress detection, typical UV-induced responses such as keratinocyte death and epidermal swelling were suppressed. This suggests that ZAK alpha’s activation by &lt;strong&gt;damaged messenger RNA (mRNA)&lt;/strong&gt; precedes and may override DNA-dependent pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RNA Damage as the Signal Origin&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core mechanism centers on what researchers described as the &lt;strong&gt;ribotoxic stress response (RSR)&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon UVB exposure, damaged mRNA triggers ZAK alpha to initiate inflammatory signaling and programmed cell death. “We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to UV radiation is damage to the RNA,” said Simon Bekker-Jensen, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Copenhagen, “and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-1200x1200.jpeg.webp" alt="Zak Knockout Mice" class="wp-image-117964" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-scaled.jpeg.webp 1200w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-420x420.jpeg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-160x160.jpeg.webp 160w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-520x520.jpeg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RNA damage from UV-B activates ZAKα, triggering a stress response in skin cells. The pathway leads to cytokine production, cell death (via JNK and p38), and inflammation. In mouse models, wild-type mice showed typical sunburn responses—immune cell infiltration and epidermal thickening—while ZAKα knockout mice did not, confirming ZAKα’s key role in mediating UV-induced skin inflammation. Credit: Molecular Cell Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In knockout mice lacking the &lt;strong&gt;ZAK gene&lt;/strong&gt;, those acute inflammatory markers were notably absent. In vitro tests using cultured human keratinocytes revealed the same pathway activation: &lt;strong&gt;RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt; activated pyroptotic and apoptotic death via the &lt;strong&gt;p38&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JNK&lt;/strong&gt; signaling routes, respectively. This dual-pathway activation reinforces the premise that ZAK alpha governs &lt;strong&gt;early UV stress responses&lt;/strong&gt; through cytoplasmic signals rather than nuclear genome surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Friction Point: Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Textbook Realignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate friction point is conceptual and infrastructural. &lt;strong&gt;Sunscreen formulations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UV protection protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;dermatological interventions&lt;/strong&gt; have historically been modeled around DNA-centric assumptions. The shift toward RNA-first mechanisms compels a reevaluation of &lt;strong&gt;photoimmunology models&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly for inflammatory conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;polymorphic light eruption&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;UV-aggravated eczema&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ZAK alpha’s role as a molecular sentinel introduces both &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic markers&lt;/strong&gt;. Potential pharmaceutical interventions that modulate the RSR pathway may offer new methods for &lt;strong&gt;controlling UV-induced skin inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, independent of mutagenic &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/chernobyls-dogs-are-transforming-at-record-speed-what-radiation-is-really-doing-to-their-dna/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97247" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA repair processes&lt;/a&gt;. However, these applications remain theoretical; as of January 2026, no ZAK alpha inhibitors have entered clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by faculty at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with NTU’s &lt;em&gt;Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, indicates a broader need for academic and medical reassessment. Assistant Professor Anna Constance Vind, a co-author of the study, noted, “This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educational and clinical materials reliant on DNA-centric inflammation models will likely need revision to include the role of RNA and ribosomal stress pathways. Key areas of impact include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical curricula&lt;/strong&gt; covering dermatology, cell signaling, and photobiology&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textbooks and training programs&lt;/strong&gt; for dermatologists and general practitioners&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; involving inflammatory skin responses to UV&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug discovery pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; targeting early UV damage detection and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this RNA-centric model applies uniformly across skin types, UV spectrum ranges, and environmental exposure durations remains under investigation. The interaction between &lt;strong&gt;long-term DNA mutations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;acute RNA signaling&lt;/strong&gt; is also unresolved; they may operate on separate timelines, with independent but complementary biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;

To estimate smoke exposure, researchers used a model to estimate levels of PM 2.5 at each individual’s home address during their pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a650f6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This paper supports other scientific research that links prenatal exposure to air pollution, particularly PM 2.5 to autism,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the nonprofit Autism Science Foundation, who was not involved in the study. “The size of the risk is not huge, but it is consistent with other research and adds to a body of scientific literature linking air pollution and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44f120" class="body-graf"&gt;“Both autism and wildfires are on the rise, and this study is just the beginning of investigating links between the two,” said senior study author Mostafijur Rahman, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-50e48b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31960f" class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed health records of more than 200,000 births in Southern California from 2006 through 2014. California, the researchers said, leads the country in both yearly acres burned by wildfire and rates of childhood autism diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dc4040" class="body-graf"&gt;The increased risk was strongest when mothers were exposed to wildfire smoke during the third trimester (the last three months of pregnancy), especially during stretches of multiple smoky days, rather than from overall average pollution levels alone, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56af5" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk of autism diagnosis was about 10% higher for children whose mothers experienced 1 to 5 smokey days in the third trimester, 12% higher with 6 to 10 days and 23% higher with more than 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afa41f" class="body-graf"&gt;The association was clearest among women who didn’t change residences during pregnancy, suggesting that sustained exposure in the same location — not just occasional smoke — may play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0fed" class="body-graf"&gt;The study, however, doesn’t explain why wildfire smoke may increase autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1226a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Rahman said wildfire smoke is quite different from other pollutants, such as traffic pollutants, that people are exposed to on an almost everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a687f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Wildfire smoke has a unique chemical composition,” he said, “including higher levels of carbon compounds, metal, toxic byproducts, and it tends to occur in intense and short term spikes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ec2e6" class="body-graf"&gt;The third trimester is a critical period in a fetus’s development, said lead study author David Luglio, a post-doctoral fellow with the Celia Scott Weatherhead School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e932f4" class="body-graf"&gt;“In terms of the brain, and the late trimester, this is when the brain really grows in size and develops its main centers,” he said. He added that the findings shouldn’t cause alarm, noting that autism isn’t limited to environmental factors, but is also believed to have a strong genetic component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b698aa" class="body-graf"&gt;Halladay said exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 have already been linked to lower birthweight, higher levels of preterm births, asthma and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-581c97" class="body-graf"&gt;“So close monitoring, as well as mitigation of air pollution, should be a priority for regulatory agencies going forward,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3c3570" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More research is needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b1b46" class="body-graf"&gt;Autism spectrum disorder — characterized by challenges with social and communication skills and by repetitive behaviors — affects 1 in 31 school-aged children in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-rates-up-cdc-report-2025-rfk-jr-rcna201305" target="_blank"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2cb9dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The disorder is believed to be “multifactorial,” said Dr. Akhgar Ghassabian, an associate professor of pediatrics and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, with several environmental factors “shown to be involved, particularly if these environmental exposures happen during early life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b37db5" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with the backing of President Donald Trump, has made autism a high-profile research priority, saying that health officials want to better understand the condition’s “root causes,” including potential environmental causes, such as air pollution, chemicals and medicine. Kennedy has also promoted unproven treatments, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-touted-drug-leucovorin-autism-families-already-tried-rcna233291" target="_blank"&gt;including leucovorin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic form of vitamin B9 or folate, which the body needs to make healthy blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9953b7" class="body-graf"&gt;In September, Trump claimed without new evidence that acetaminophen — the active ingredient in the pain reliever Tylenol — was a cause of autism, a statement that drew intense pushback from OB-GYNs, autism advocacy groups and international health organizations, like the World Health Organization. A large new analysis found &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tylenol-pregnancy-safe-no-link-autism-trump-kennedy-rcna253662" target="_blank"&gt;no link between acetaminophen and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc643c" class="body-graf"&gt;David Mandell, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the idea that wildfire smoke exposure could raise autism risk is broadly consistent with previous research linking air pollution exposure during the mother's pregnancy to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5490c" class="body-graf"&gt;But he said that he was cautious about how the study’s findings were interpreted, noting that the observed effects were small and that the highest exposure group did not show a clear increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f8a9e" class="body-graf"&gt;“They do see a more elevated risk at the second-highest exposure level in the third trimester among nonmovers, but not at the highest exposure level,” Mandell said. “This lack of a dose response makes me skeptical about the findings. I’d definitely want to see a replication before I put a lot of stock in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce563b" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors note the study has limitations: Exposure estimates were based on outdoor air, and researchers don’t know how much smoke people were exposed to indoors, or whether they used air filters, wore masks or altered their behavior during a wildfire event. Rahman said further studies are still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4babe" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, he said, “reinforce the importance of minimizing smoke exposure during a wildfire event when possible and following the public health guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-413477" class="body-graf"&gt;Mandell said that he hopes an administration "truly interested in improving child outcomes would strengthen" the Environmental Protection Agency and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency "to reduce pollution and help families cope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d2c20" class="body-graf"&gt;“This administration seems to be going in the absolute opposite direction,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06a458" class="body-graf"&gt;Rahman said he is also curious whether prevention — such as masks or air purifiers — may reduce the risk seen in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98c81a" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Wildfire smoke is a potentially preventable environmental exposure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWi1pUkV5ZEI2WUtsR0tFYTJ2V2dtekZWd3dNb0tiaTJFbHl6N2FINHZFbWR6MDhRc2psTEE1XzJJcVBuemxKODhrcWlSblFnc2F6ZUVKMnlCc25nTzh3eVFVYS1URFZNV01tRnBkNFZTc2c5cnJteS00YldJdTR3Q0JtaEJQQl9yRjhrUG16bG5kT1g2RmN4c2lMVUkzczFWY3gycmpvTzlHNDNURXhF</guid></item><item><title>对于劳德代尔堡高中排球明星Sun Sentinel来说，鼻窦感染危及生命</title><link>https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2026/01/20/sinus-infection-turns-life-threatening-for-a-fort-lauderdale-high-school-volleyball-star/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the winter cold season arrived and high school volleyball season approached, a stuffy nose and a headache were annoyances for 15-year-old Aedan Jones, not alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But days before Christmas, the Fort Lauderdale High School junior’s headache worsened, and a fever set in. What happened next set into motion a spiral of events that turned a sinus infection into a brain infection and launched Jones’ ongoing battle to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight fever, Jones’ mother brought her typically healthy son to the urgent care, where doctors ruled out the flu and COVID and suggested Motrin and Tylenol.  For a few days, Jones felt a bit better, the pressure in his sinuses and fever easing. On Christmas Eve, though, his situation deteriorated rapidly. He awoke with the left side of his face numb, his left eyelid drooping, and he couldn’t pick up his left leg to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we arrived at Joe DiMaggio, he looked like he had a stroke,” said Jodi Washington, Jones’ mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergency room doctors moved quickly. They saw the droopy eyelid, the subtle facial asymmetry, and the confusion. The images from an MRI head scan came back terrifying, his mother said. There, in Jones’ frontal lobe, nestled dangerously close to the areas controlling speech and movement, was a collection of pus. A sinus infection, a typically benign annoyance, had traveled through the thin bone separating his sinus cavity from his brain, allowing bacteria to seep in and spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to operate immediately,” Dr. Dean Hertzler, a neurosurgeon at Joe DiMaggio, told Washington. “The pressure is building, and if we don’t drain this, it could cause permanent damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a sinus infection evolving into a brain infection is rare in children, doctors are seeing it more often. “Thousands and thousands of people get sinus infections,” Hertzler said.  “It’s a very small percentage that this happens to. With children, late elementary into the teens is when we see it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon hours of Christmas Eve, Hertzler carefully navigated the delicate tissues of Jones’ brain. “The surgery itself is much less risky than not doing it,” the neurosurgeon said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;First the medical team drained the pus collected in Jones’ brain. “It was pretty infected, so we washed it all out, and then the ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor went in and washed out the sinuses, and we got cultures for treating the infection,” Hertzler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As doctors moved swiftly, the South Florida volleyball community rallied, setting up &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/hope-and-care-for-aedans-toughest-match"&gt;a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; and praying for Jones’ rapid recovery. “Aedan is a driven, competitive volleyball player who gives everything he has — to his team, his sport, and those around him,” Misty Connelly wrote on the fundraising page.  “Right now, however, he is facing the toughest match of his life. Our volleyball community — and all those who know and care about Aedan — are coming together to support him and his family during this incredibly difficult time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connelly, a fellow parent of a player on the Ocean Bay Volleyball Club, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel: “Aedan is a spitfire, a jokester, a fun kid to be around. He is not the tallest on the court, but he is the most explosive.” She said teammates, as well as those on competing teams, want to support him. “We know it’s going to be a long road ahead for him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the surgery at Joe DiMaggio went well,  an infection continued to spread in his brain. A few days after his Christmas Eve surgery, Jones suffered an 18-minute seizure. Another MRI brain scan found he had a big pocket of pus in the orbit behind his left eye, creating pressure.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Jones was then transferred to Miami’s Holtz Children’s Hospital, where he could access specialists at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s been in intensive care this entire time,” Washington said. “They took him off the ventilator and he is breathing on his own again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Holtz, Jones continues to fight the brain infection and has undergone multiple surgeries, including one last week.   He has had surgery to drain his sinuses again, another to remove bacteria  behind the eye, and a third in parts of the brain that affect movement on his right side. A team of doctors from various specialties participates in his medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had him on broad-spectrum antibiotics to try to treat the infection, and he did regain movement of the right side and the ability to speak,” said Dr. Heather McCrea, director of pediatric neurosurgery at Holtz Children’s Hospital. “We do surgery because antibiotics are not going to work quickly enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrea said the bacteria in Jones’ brain while at Joe DiMaggio differ from those found in his brain while at Holtz.  “It’s likely one of the bacteria was being partially treated, but other bacteria may not be fully treated and continued to cause problems,” McCrea said. “Now he’s on three different antibiotics at strong levels to cover anything that could be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones, the youngest of Washington’s three children, had played in a volleyball tournament in Los Angeles only nine days before he landed in the hospital. “He is one of those kids who have a magnetic personality and can connect with anybody,” Washington said. “Even in the ICU, his personality is shining through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, Jones works to resume his previous strength and abilities. He is getting physical, occupational and speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He can talk and communicate, but he doesn’t always get his words out,” his mother said. “His speech is really slurred, but it’s coming back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrea said she is pleased to see Jones talking and walking. “He is making great strides.” Soon, he will get another MRI of his brain to see if he is clear of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington said she recognizes recovery will take time and require emotional and financial support. She has been by her son’s side in the intensive care unit day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m one of those people, I never ask for help,” she said. “Aedan’s got a really supportive family around him, and we always just kind of make things happen. But I am grateful that people really want to do something to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCrea at Holtz said she and other pediatric neurosurgeons in the U.S. are collaborating to determine why Jones and other young people have been experiencing sinus infections that spread to the brain more often in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are looking closely at it because there’s a thought that this has increased in frequency post-COVID,” she said. “We are really trying to get at what has caused this increase. We’ve been looking at commonalities between these cases as well as the treatments to improve care for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors like Hertzler and McCrea advise parents to bring children, including teens, to a doctor immediately if they complain of a severe headache or sinus pressure. “If they have a true sinus infection, then they will likely need antibiotics to clear that and the pediatrician is the best first step for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

After a night of poor sleep, it becomes harder to stay focused. Thoughts drift, reaction times slow, and mental clarity fades when attention is needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from MIT sheds light on what is happening inside the brain during these brief lapses in focus. The study shows that when attention momentarily fails, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) moves out of the brain, a process that normally happens during sleep and helps clear away waste that accumulates throughout the day. This cleansing activity is considered important for keeping the brain healthy and functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is sleep-deprived, the body appears to try to make up for lost rest by triggering bursts of this fluid movement during wakefulness. That compensation, however, comes with a significant downside: sharply reduced attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow," says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis is the senior author of the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. MIT postdoctoral associate Zinong Yang is the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Sleep Cleans the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is essential for survival, yet scientists still do not fully understand why it plays such a critical role. What is clear is that sleep is necessary for staying alert, and that losing sleep reliably harms attention and other mental abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important function of sleep involves cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds and cushions the brain. During sleep, CSF helps flush out waste that builds up during waking hours. In a 2019 study, Lewis and her colleagues found that this fluid moves in a rhythmic pattern as people sleep, closely linked to shifts in brain wave activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That earlier discovery raised a new question: what happens to this fluid system when sleep is disrupted? To find out, the researchers recruited 26 volunteers who completed testing twice, once after a night of sleep deprivation in the lab and once after being well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning, participants completed a standard task used to assess the effects of sleep loss while researchers tracked a wide range of brain and body signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Attention and Brain Fluid Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the experiment, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap to monitor brain activity while lying inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The team used a specialized version of fMRI that could track both blood oxygen levels and the movement of CSF in and out of the brain. Heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil size were also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed two attention tests inside the scanner, one visual and one auditory. In the visual task, they watched a fixed cross on a screen that occasionally changed into a square. They were instructed to press a button whenever the change occurred. In the auditory task, the visual cue was replaced by a sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, sleep-deprived participants performed significantly worse than when they were well-rested. Their reactions were slower, and in some cases they failed to notice the signal entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these brief attention failures occurred, the researchers observed multiple physiological changes happening at the same time. Most notably, CSF moved outward from the brain during the lapse and then flowed back in once attention returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it's drawn back in," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team believes this pattern reflects the brain's attempt to compensate for missed sleep by activating a cleaning process that normally occurs at night, even though doing so temporarily disrupts attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," Yang says. "Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brain and Body System Working Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that attention lapses are linked to changes beyond the brain itself. During these moments, breathing and heart rate slowed, and pupils became smaller. Pupil constriction began roughly 12 seconds before CSF moved out of the brain and reversed after attention returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's interesting is it seems like this isn't just a phenomenon in the brain, it's also a body-wide event. It suggests that there's a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it's also reflecting an event that's happening throughout the brain and body," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a single control system may coordinate both attention and basic bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest to us that there's a unified circuit that's governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain -- our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world -- and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers did not identify the specific circuit involved, they point to the noradrenergic system as a strong candidate. This system, which uses the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to regulate cognition and bodily functions, is known to fluctuate during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljntw200003b6sk8birl15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuesday marks one year since a measles outbreak started in West Texas, and there have been new cases in the United States each week since.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklkveu400063b6s3rznp2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas reported more than 760 cases — and the deaths of two children – before declaring the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt; in August. It was the largest outbreak the US had seen in decades, and since then, other large outbreaks — one in the upstate region of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/health/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-challenges"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and another on the border of Utah and Arizona — have amassed hundreds of cases each and continue to expand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklmnmms00003b6p6514ffko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first two weeks of 2026 have been some of the worst yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/health/measles-exposure-what-to-do-wellness"&gt;exposures&lt;/a&gt; reported at schools, churches, restaurants, shops, airports and more. The continuous spread of measles over the past year leaves the US at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/health/measles-elimination-investigation"&gt;risk of losing elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which the country has held since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklleh3k00023b6se27yx7ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is startling, because just a few years ago measles was very rare in the United States,” said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, ​an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkllgjel00053b6s9l2ll65n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now we’re seeing in a single week what we might have seen in an average year,” she said. “There’s been a real shift in the presence of this preventable disease in our life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklni3my00063b6puk4qsw4z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether that balance can shift back depends on how quickly the US can improve vaccination coverage, experts say – which, in many ways, has become an uphill battle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkllgsy000083b6s3na67xuy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, which is nearly as many as the average annual total in those 25 years since elimination in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklllcmx000c3b6sx5ue5xi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases — more than 95% — have been in people who had not been vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljkbef006p27nxb77a4ckg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts fear that the situation may have to get much worse before it gets better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklk0u0500013b6su7fizaud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s particularly devastating, they say, because the illnesses and deaths they foresee are almost entirely preventable with the help of vaccines — but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis"&gt;lagging coverage&lt;/a&gt; has left many vulnerable.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f00083b6ptxalh4rr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not clear yet whether the US will maintain its measles elimination status. In April, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, will formally make the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;determination&lt;/a&gt;. The decision will require detailed review of epidemiological and laboratory evidence to understand patterns of measles spread over the past year — including whether more recent outbreaks are linked to the Texas outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f00093b6p7h6jwvnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But experts say that formally losing measles elimination status would be a symptom of more deeply rooted issues, particularly challenges with vaccination that have been building for many years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000a3b6pdd3p39mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let’s face it, whether we lose elimination status or not in spring, is our public health system actually doing well?” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who resigned in protest last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000b3b6pzhoqg2r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles elimination is a vital sign of our public health system. That public health system is blue in the ICU,” he said. “I don’t need to check its pulse to know [it’s not doing well]. I know the answer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000c3b6pu6zooffj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination last school year, according to data from the CDC, marking the fifth year in a row that coverage with the MMR vaccine was been below the federal target of 95%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklwh4q900003b6s3bxua13a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says that the increase in vaccine exemptions may be “due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy.” A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a “medical” reason to request an exemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000d3b6ph96jf0tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines are a victim of their own success. It’s not just that we eliminated measles. I think we eliminated the memory of measles,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000e3b6pvk9mmrj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Offit remembers speaking with&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC557162/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Maurice Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist who developed the MMR vaccine and dozens of others, just months before Hilleman’s death in 2005. Measles cases had reached a record low in 2004 but were starting to trend up again, just a few years after the US had achieved elimination following a long and hard-fought battle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000f3b6p2rdjhwku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I asked him, ‘Do you think that we can educate people about the importance of the vaccine, about the serious nature of this disease, or does the virus have to come back?” Offit said. He said there was a tear in his eye when he replied that virus was going to have to come back to teach that lesson.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000g3b6p6ebs73pf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That was an enormous defeat for him,” Offit said. “It’s an enormous defeat for us to once again see children be exposed to something that could kill them — and did kill them – in this country, when that was completely unnecessary.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000h3b6pd2rpeowp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it seems more and more that the virus isn’t necessarily doing that educating either, Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000i3b6pytcripbb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were three deaths from measles last year — as many as there had been over the past 25 years combined — yet it’s been a struggle to increase vaccination rates, even in communities that experienced outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000j3b6pha5k9q6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The South Carolina health department has offered a mobile vaccination clinic since the early weeks of the outbreak in the upstate region of the state, but state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell has said that uptake has been “disappointing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000k3b6pb555xjf2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles outbreaks tend to occur in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis"&gt;under vaccinated pockets&lt;/a&gt; of the US, often in tight-knit communities, such as those with certain religious beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000l3b6p4eyp37nw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daskalakis says that there’s a new type of tight-knit community in the US – one that’s less geographically connected, but created and held together by the spread of anti-vaccine messaging, including by US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others at the extremes of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/politics/rfk-vaccines-covid-maha-cassidy-explainer"&gt;MAHA movement&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000m3b6pdxgtetxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The mission since the dawn of the vaccination program in America is that if we can prevent a disease with a vaccine that has an extremely favorable risk-to-benefit profile, that we do it,” Daskalakis said. “It seems as if the value of that strategy has been minimized for some populations. Not for everybody, but enough where I expect that measles is going to be a part of our future, at least in the medium-, if not long-term.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklo8k24000d3b6pazd5mo7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says that Kennedy has been “clear and consistent” in his messaging that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles, but the agency also says that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines"&gt;individuals should consult with their health care provider&lt;/a&gt; about what is best for them and their family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkltbwue00003b6sj3aaqcvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS recently made sweeping changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, now recommending fewer vaccines for most American children in a move Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2026/2026-cdc-acts-on-presidential-memorandum-to-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.” MMR vaccine recommendations were not changed, but experts worry it could contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;broader doubts about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000n3b6p0byetz29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unclear what will change individual minds about vaccination, experts say — perhaps a recalibration of public health messaging and more families fearing measles reaching their doorstep — but the risk for increasingly large outbreaks mean there will be many preventable illnesses and deaths ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000o3b6pjoiltlou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have already been more than 550 measles cases in the South Carolina outbreak, and at least one out of every 1,000 people with measles may die.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklkk5au00003b6ph4mwsxpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a matter of numbers. The more cases there are, the more opportunities there are for severe illness,” said Rivers, whose organization developed a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;measles case tracker&lt;/a&gt; and worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000p3b6pne8cr3ac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raising vaccination rates is the best way to keep cases to a minimum and prevent those tragic outcomes, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000q3b6pvl8ubq7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could happen in a matter of months, Rivers said. It’s how other large outbreaks have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;brought to a halt&lt;/a&gt;. But the potential for change may depend on whether people are perceiving these outbreaks as threats to their own lives, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000r3b6p46oonp2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With sufficient attention, motivation and policy changes like strengthening school entry requirements, we can get those coverage levels up very quickly,” she said. “We have all the pieces in place. We just need families to understand how important it is, and that piece could take years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000s3b6pj46i7ide@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The increase in the frequency and size of measles outbreaks will certainly put additional strain on public health, Daskalakis says. Continuing to build relationships and lean on trusted partners within local communities can help reinforce critical messaging about the importance of vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000t3b6p53r8uc7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, optimism persists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000u3b6p1efdssim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is what public health does,” Daskalakis said. “Public health is never static. There’s always a new challenge, there’s always new misinformation and, frankly, also new information that moves you in a different direction.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

But type “parasite cleanse” into TikTok or Instagram and you’ll be inundated with so-called experts peddling expensive herbal supplements that promise to detox the body and rid it of harmful worms and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One TikTok user, whose credentials are “holistic mama”, suggests people should do deworming cleanses if they experience “sleep issues, gut issues, weight loss issues, mood swings, skin issues”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It would be nearly impossible to find a single human not dealing with at least one of these issues. Does that mean everyone should be on a parasite cleanse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“NO,” Caroline Susie, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics wrote in all caps over email. She emphasized that there was no solid clinical evidence behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ideally, all-caps discouragement from a medical professional would be enough reason to steer clear of something. But if you’re still unconvinced, here’s what to know about parasite cleanses, and why you probably don’t need to do one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-parasites" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are parasites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parasites are organisms that live in, on or with another organism and get their food “from or at the expense of its host”, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. For example: tapeworms, fleas or me when I lived at my parents’ house after college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Humans contract parasites in several ways, says Beth Czerwony, outpatient dietitian for Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. These include ingestion of contaminated food or water and direct contact with infected feces, she explains. Some parasites, like hookworm, can also penetrate the skin when a person walks barefoot on contaminated soil, and others can be transmitted person to person in unhygienic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US and UK, the most common intestinal parasites are giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, says Dr William A Petri, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Virginia. Both are transmitted through the ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parasitic infections are extremely common. According to a 2023 World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/soil-transmitted-helminth-infections" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, almost 25% of the global population has an infection related to parasitic worms like roundworms, whipworms and hookworms. These infections tend to be concentrated in “the poorest and most deprived communities” where people lack access to clean water and sanitation, per the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having intestinal parasites is less common in places with good sanitation,” says Czerwony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-a-parasitic-infection" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of a parasitic infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms vary based on the type of parasite and the health of the host, says Czerwony. Often, symptoms include conditions like diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite or increase in hunger, unexplained weight loss, skin irritation, visible worms or eggs in one’s stool, and itching around the anus or genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-parasite-cleanse" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a ‘parasite cleanse’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Klum said of her own cleanse that it had “all these herbs”. Most of those so-called remedies peddled on social media &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/parasite-cleanse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;involve&lt;/a&gt; taking herbal supplements (like anise, clove, grapeseed, wormwood and goldenseal), dietary changes (like eliminating processed foods or cutting out gluten) or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-it-work" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is no evidence that these parasite cleanses are either effective or needed,” says Petri. And if someone feels better after one of these cleanses, it’s probably not the result of parasites, says Susie – it might simply be that they’re eating more nutrient-dense food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At-home cleanses are also not without risks. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2026/jan/08/supplements-vitamins-safety-dosage-limit-guide" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Supplements are not regulated&lt;/a&gt;, Susie notes. Additionally, she says, some herbs can interact with other medications and be toxic at high doses. Restrictive diets can also lead to nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-treat-a-parasitic-infection" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you treat a parasitic infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you think you may have a parasite, it is important to contact a medical professional and not treat it yourself,” says Czerwony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Infections can be diagnosed with stool samples or blood tests and, in some cases, with imaging tests like endoscopies or colonoscopies, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a patient does have a parasitic infection, treatment depends on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection. Often, doctors will prescribe antiparasitic or antibiotic medications, and/or rehydration and nutrition support if severe weight loss has occurred, Czerwony says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="did-the-parasite-cleanse-work-for-heidi-klum" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the parasite cleanse work for Heidi Klum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="fc789204-afae-4504-9260-710036d6f7fa" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Heidi Klum’s worm costume.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Rex/Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unclear, but probably not.

This video showed an adorable &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Teddy, never growing out of his cute paw gesture, which he has displayed ever since he was just a little pup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On January 18, the paw parent shared the heartwarming video on Instagram through the account @aguyandagoldenn. The clip has gone viral since then, garnering more than 130K likes as of now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever has a specific way of giving his paw in adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A heart-melting &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-labdrador-wanting-help-newborn-150000599.html" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram captured a cute Golden retriever named Teddy, who has a very particular way of giving his paw to his human parent. It remained the same since he was a puppy. The video has been winning hearts on the internet as people can’t get enough of the fur baby’s cuteness. In the caption of the post, the pet parent penned, “Grey hairs may be showing, but he has LOTS of pranks and change in the world left to make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Instagram video began by giving a closer look at the Golden Retriever, Teddy. He could be seen sitting calmly inside a car. In the meantime, the text written over the clip read, “When his face is turning grey.” Soon, viewers could see the dog gently placing his paw on his parent’s hand after they gave him some belly rubs. Soon, the text of the video changed into “Take me back.” At that time, the clip displayed a precious throwback moment when the dog was just a pup. Even as a puppy, he could be seen giving his tiny paw to his owner in the same adorable way. The video will brighten up anybody’s day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the comments section of the Instagram video, one fan wrote, “Omg the way he hold your hand.” “Big Teddy is just as adorable as baby Teddy,” expressed another admirer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/203497-golden-retriever-paw-adorable-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video Shows Golden Retriever Never Grew Out of His Paw Gesture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video Shows Golden Retriever Never Grew Out of His Paw Gesture&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:53:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxORHZWTTA4NEctM1U2WHJjQ21TMTNSdVVnVUJhVnNrWUVoeTJxWjRITWdZRXhKcGNHdk9xMmxYSWlXa0Nxem5ra0xpSU5jS0V3dURqcjBKWjFOdG9YYlBmcVp3b0l1RV9pWlFXeDZUdDhjVU1HYWRBaFB4ZGVQVm01dmNFQnFfUllPbzlhaWdOYjg5cGx5</guid></item><item><title>《精神病学圣经》会增加产后精神病诊断吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/health/postpartum-psychosis-dsm-diagnosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQQ0NXdDdVX3ZzbGczUWxGNnBCcnR6WEVhODh4U1k3QkVXUlc3REFKdW45RlpEaXBtbW9BQm9BZjQxR002N2FJeDRwaHVHQUF5YzNmcHZmclAzbEFENF94WWlYaHgybDMwTFJDTGEzMllSa3NoYkhSaUxPcjdUNnpQQVdfRnBfd0It</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.正在对女性发动战争-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/technology/2026/01/rfk-jr-maha-women-moms-science.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkhegg2y00gnzskwiwzo9dtm@published"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way first: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not going to be successful at his stated MAHA goal. You can’t make America healthier—I refuse to even say “again” when &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/life-expectancy-history-public-health-and-medical-advances-that-lead-to-long-lives.html"&gt;we weren’t healthy before&lt;/a&gt;—while you are simultaneously so &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/house-democrats-slam-rfk-jr-research-funding-cuts-vaccine-policy"&gt;drastically slashing&lt;/a&gt; budgets for scientific research. You also can’t make America healthier while ignoring any expert who is not a crackpot—and so very much data—on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/im-a-physician-who-has-looked-at-hundreds-of-studies-of-vaccine-safety-and-heres-some-of-what-rfk-jr-gets-wrong-259659"&gt;the basics of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. More minimally, you can’t make America healthier while claiming that, say, seed oils are the devil (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/sweetgreen-menu-salad-nutrition-seed-oil.html"&gt;seed oils are innocent&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3px000o357bj3dyz1q3@published"&gt;So the question isn’t whether RFK Jr. will make America healthier. On balance, he will only be a disaster for American health. (Sure, he will occasionally get things right—this fact brings to mind the saying about &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_stopped_clock_is_right_twice_a_day"&gt;broken clocks&lt;/a&gt;, and the one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"&gt;about a monkey at a typewriter and &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But what will he actually do?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3sm000p357bigw43aqz@published"&gt;Well, to be sure, he will make life worse—&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/rfk-jr-vaccines-mrna-dangerous-diseases-deaths.html"&gt;and shorter&lt;/a&gt;—for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-hhs-job-cuts-minority-health-offices.html"&gt;lots of groups of people&lt;/a&gt;. But as a person who recently gave birth to a baby and spent months watching and reading the news from maternity leave, my answer to that question is: RFK Jr. is waging a war on women.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3w0000q357blqahgqf8@published"&gt;Let’s go through some of the ways. Kennedy is encouraging women to breastfeed, to provide their babies with, &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/news-conference/user-clip-rfk-jr-on-breastfeeding-and-infant-formula/5183687"&gt;as he puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “the infant formula that God made, the infant formula in a mother’s breast.” (Would that not be the infant formula that the &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; made, with her own body? I digress.) While increasing breastfeeding rates is a goal shared by many legitimate public health experts (see: broken clock), the biological advantages of breastfeeding are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/20/is-breast-really-best-i-looked-at-all-the-data-to-find-out"&gt;somewhat limited&lt;/a&gt;, making this a strange enterprise for a government official. But more to the point, the costs of breastfeeding, particularly exclusively breastfeeding with no supplement from formula, are huge. For women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3z0000r357bpln4o8pa@published"&gt;Namely, breastfeeding is very time-consuming, even in the best of circumstances. (In the worst, it can involve women working on the project of feeding their infant at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/10/traded-sanity-for-milk-breastfed-despite-the-pain"&gt;great expense to their own well-being&lt;/a&gt;.) Formula—real, store-bought formula—is, except in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/response-broader-fda-investigation-byheart-initiates-voluntary-recall-two-batches-infant-formula"&gt;freak cases&lt;/a&gt; of contamination, a perfectly safe and good option for getting babies fed, right now. Nonetheless, Kennedy has, along with his weird breastfeeding comments, simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHd6XoDvp9O/"&gt;widely publicized&lt;/a&gt; a project “to make sure infant formula products are safe and wholesome.” What Kennedy really stands to do here is scare women away from a method of nourishing their babies that is perfectly acceptable, that is healthy, and that stands to make life easier—and in some cases, simply livable—for us by introducing his classic fearmongering tactics to matters that have already been settled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="215" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh41x000s357buj4x7i2n@published"&gt;Then there’s the Tylenol fiasco. Kennedy has called on women to restrict the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to cases where it is “absolutely necessary.” For the unaware, Tylenol is somewhat notoriously a medicine that is deemed safe during pregnancy—the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that Tylenol is “one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever.” There are all kinds of very sensible recommendations against taking certain substances during pregnancy, if at all possible, and Tylenol is not one of them. So where is Kennedy getting this? It’s another fear campaign. The evidence regarding Tylenol use while with child, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5582061-kennedy-trump-tylenol-autism/"&gt;he notes&lt;/a&gt;, “is not sufficient to say it definitely caused autism, but it is very suggestive.” These comments came on the heels of Donald Trump’s even stronger warning: “Don’t take Tylenol. Don’t take it. Fight like hell not to take it.” Science, of course, always &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; find a link &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2026/01/microplastics-brain-research-not-bad.html"&gt;between any given thing and anything else&lt;/a&gt;, but it is telling that the studies done so far on Tylenol and autism &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/health/kennedy-autism-tylenol-trump.html"&gt;have, taken together, not found anything conclusive&lt;/a&gt;. And still, Kennedy is &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5518478-tylenol-acetaminophen-pregnancy-risks/"&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to knock the bottle from our hands during what is, for some women, one of the most physically unpleasant times of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh44o000t357b7yrk0xj3@published"&gt;The war on women shows up less obviously, but perhaps with even more wide-reaching consequences, in other RFK Jr. projects. Take his stance on vaccines. He recently oversaw the removal of several from the recommended childhood immunization schedule. Who, by and large in America, will be taking care of the kids who have to stay home from school when they get sick? Who will take them to the emergency room? Who will &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmerAcadPeds/posts/an-infant-born-prematurely-and-infected-with-measles-has-died-in-canada-the-infa/1132893888872170/"&gt;bear the blame&lt;/a&gt; when what happens is even worse than an ER visit? Disproportionately, women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh473000u357b0mtcy6tg@published"&gt;Then take his stance against ultraprocessed foods, which he has &lt;a href="https://time.com/7211678/rfk-jr-ultra-processed-foods-ban/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; a “mass poison”—and the fact that in his new food guidance, he advises that children should avoid sugar through age 10. Who will be ensuring that a Lunchable never so much as touches a child’s lips? (Lunchables: They are not healthy, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/04/lead-lunchables-consumer-reports-california-regulations-unhealthy.html"&gt;but they are safe&lt;/a&gt;!) Who will be convincing 9-year-olds to forgo birthday cake, or figuring out what to present as a birthday treat if it is not cake? Probably the group of people who mostly take care of children: women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh49u000v357b0ebhj9vo@published"&gt;For the record, ultraprocessed foods are not even inherently bad. The fact is that they are a tool (like formula, like Tylenol) that can make life easier, more manageable, and even—by extension—&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/01/ultraprocessed-foods-healthy-energy-fear-trader-joes.html"&gt;literally healthier&lt;/a&gt;. These tools also allow women tasked with gestating children, caring for infants, and doing housework to not be completely consumed by it. Consider: Who even has time to prepare food entirely from scratch? To breastfeed exclusively? To lie there pregnant and in pain, just for the sake of it? A woman who does not work outside the home.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4d9000w357bogvkdvev@published"&gt;Yes, women could always&lt;em&gt; just not &lt;/em&gt;follow Kennedy’s advice. Just use formula. Just take Tylenol! Just make &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/07/dont-panic-over-the-chemicals-in-your-mac-and-cheese.html"&gt;the mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt; for dinner. Just vaccinate your children. I am personally &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/09/anne-helen-petersen-burnout-book-reviewed.html"&gt;a huge fan of &lt;em&gt;just exercising your own agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But there are two issues here: One is the incredible swirl of half-realized health information that women &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have to navigate, both when it comes to finding answers through official channels (doctors, often, simply have no answer for &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/08/pain-sex-vestibulodynia-physical-therapy-hormones.html"&gt;even basic inquiries into our pain&lt;/a&gt;) and when it comes to logging onto any social media site for any reason. There are just so many autoplaying videos of influencers out there issuing dire warnings about one thing or another that we already have to navigate, even though most of it has to do with the danger of not buying this or that gadget, or course, or coaching session that they so happen to be selling.&lt;/p&gt;

He has overseen cuts to offices in the Department of Health and Human Services that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-hhs-job-cuts-minority-health-offices.html"&gt;work to improve minority health&lt;/a&gt;. He has done a “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;clean sweep&lt;/a&gt;” of the panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control on vaccines in order to appoint his own people. He has, in his first year at HHS, “significantly thinned out the sprawling $1.7 trillion department,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-kennedy-trump-health-hhs-maha-5e1e9e3208c42b6a185facad26e3b457"&gt;as an evenhanded report from the Associated Press put it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4ja000y357bjj8bf0t8@published"&gt;When it comes to women’s health specifically, he may not have (yet) shown the specific laser-focus in cutting that he has in other areas. But he has already shown a willingness &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/md/news/whi-funding-announcement"&gt;to snatch away and dangle&lt;/a&gt; funding for research into women’s health. Last spring in a typically-chaotic MAGA move, he cut—then, following public outcry, restored—support for &lt;a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/hhs-cuts-funding-for-nih-based-women-s-health-initiative-threatening-decades-long-study"&gt;the sprawling Women’s Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4lx000z357bkc5eqrm4@published"&gt;Consider Kennedy, then, a health influencer who has not just access to a national podium, but also a say in what happens with a hulking budget. We might be able to individually ignore his advice, even as it becomes a more and more tiring process to sort out what is true and what is not, as iterations of Kennedy’s views are repeated everywhere from the social media accounts of other influencers to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism"&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt;. But we will, as the consequences of his agenda come to bear on who is hired by the government and what work they are able to do, increasingly simply be living in Kennedy’s world. The lesson for this second year of his tenure is clear: However exhausting it is, we have to pay attention. Pop a Tylenol and get ready to fight &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden Retriever pairs always look cute together, but this brother and sister duo took it to another level. This Golden Retriever video with two siblings feels like watching twins. In this wholesome video on Instagram, Cooper and Freya sit side by side and copy each other. Every little move matches, from tiny tongue flicks to the same stare. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-siblings-in-sync-surprise-wows-online-users"&gt;Golden Retriever siblings’ in-sync surprise wows online users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTkzw_KD293/?igsh=ZDVhenczYTB5eDNq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;@cooperxfreya.retriever&lt;/a&gt;, the short reel shows Cooper, an older Golden Retriever, and Freya, his younger sister. They pose in a doorway at home while the on-screen text reads, “like brother, like sister.” The two pups sit tall on the threshold, almost like they are waiting for a cue. First, their heads tilt at the same time. Then they both glance off to the side in sync. Even their little tongue pops happen together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The synchronized moment happens right at the front door, with Cooper and Freya framed by the open entryway. In the clip, the older dog stays calm and steady, while the pup mirrors him with serious focus. They both lick their noses within seconds of each other. A second later, they lift their chins and look up, as if looking at the same thing. In another beat, they yawn at the same time, which is what made viewers laugh hardest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cooper’s fluffy coat and big, relaxed posture make him look like the confident big brother. Freya keeps her paws tucked neatly and follows along like a tiny shadow. Together, they create a perfect “copy and paste” routine without trying too hard. It is the kind of sibling bond that feels natural, not trained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reactions were warm and amused. One commenter wrote, “Synced sucessful.” Another said, “No DNA test needed?.” A third added, “Omggg down to the yawn too ?.” Others chimed in too, with one writing, “So cute my bro and sis❤️,” while another simply added, “Awh so cute!” By the end, the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; siblings video leaves one clear takeaway. Some dogs just move together like they share one brain.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Cases of the flu have started to decline, according to the CDC, but flu season isn't over yet. We bust some common myths on ways to avoid catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK, Steve. Not trying to get in your biz, but has anybody in your house gotten this awful flu that's going around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, yeah. There've been a couple of people. Not me yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: Oh, my goodness. Well, you're lucky, and you're not alone. The CDC has recorded at least 18 million flu cases and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSKEEP: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: And even though reported cases have started dropping, flu season is not over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSKEEP: So we asked a professor of infectious disease what works and what does not work when trying to avoid the flu. Dr. William Schaffner teaches at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and he says one common myth leaves him cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILLIAM SCHAFFNER: It's uncomfortable to go outside in the cold with your wet hair, but that really won't predispose you to getting the flu. These flu viruses and common cold viruses are indeed viruses. You have to catch them from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: And that old saw, feed a cold, starve a fever? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAFFNER: That's an old saying, but the body needs both hydration and energy to fight off an infection. And I put the special emphasis on hydration. Keep your fluids up regardless of the kind of infection you have because if you tend to get dehydrated, you're more likely to get the complication of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSKEEP: Hydration is everything. But the professor says the No. 1 way to prevent a bad flu is? Go ahead, Michel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: Well, get your flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSKEEP: OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: And contrary to another common myth, getting vaccinated will not make you sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAFFNER: You may get a bit of a sore arm, and some people do get a degree of fever. But that is just an example of your immune system starting to develop the protection to fight off the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSKEEP: Now, the flu strain and heavy circulation this season emerged after the most recent flu shot was developed. But early research from the University of Pennsylvania finds the vaccine still helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAFFNER: Getting vaccinated is the single most important thing you can do to prevent influenza. And COVID, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: Schaffner says that's especially important for people who are older or pregnant or those at high risk because of chronic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAFFNER: If those folks are now going out indoors to crowds, put that mask back on. Keep your hand-washing up and try to avoid people who are coughing and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: And if you do get sick, Schaffner has one request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAFFNER: Please stay home. Don't go to work or school and be a dreaded spreader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: Dreaded spreader. He says the flu usually peaks in the U.S. in February, but the flu season can stick around as late as April. Time to get that shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In September, what &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; the government recommendation that everyone over 6 months get an annual Covid shot? “Shared clinical decision-making.” What’s at the heart of timing kids’ immunizations, &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-jay-bhattacharya-national-institutes-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya? “Shared decision-making.” In early January, what filled the vacuum when &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-cdc-childhood-immunization-recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal authorities&lt;/a&gt; abruptly stopped broadly endorsing vaccines against rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B for kids who aren’t deemed high-risk? “Shared clinical decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to researchers who’ve spent their careers advancing shared decision-making, federal health leaders may be distorting the concept. At its heart, it involves clinicians giving their patients accurate information about the various options before them, and then the two parties collaboratively articulating a plan built on both the scientific evidence and the person’s own goals and preferences. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts worry that recent changes disregard the important role of evidence. “It is a common misconception about shared decision-making that it somehow means that we are not supposed to or allowed to give a recommendation,” said Leigh Simmons, medical director of Massachusetts General Hospital’s Health Decision Sciences Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the term has often been associated with gray areas, in which no one option is most medically advisable, many are concerned that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the federal government’s usage&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;gives a false impression of balance, suggesting — inaccurately — that the decades of data behind something like the hepatitis B vaccine is equivocal about its benefit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What you don’t want to do is to hijack the idea,” said Glyn Elwyn, a co-founder of the International Shared Decision Making Society and a professor at Dartmouth.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The phrase “shared decision-making” is sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/achieving-personcentred-health-systems/choosing-treatments-and-the-role-of-shared-decisionmaking/D681E6E284C55D2242B5437A855923AC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traced&lt;/a&gt; back to a 1972 &lt;a href="https://bioetyka.uw.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/VeatchModels.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; by philosopher Robert Veatch entitled, “Models for Ethical Medicine in a Revolutionary Age.” At the time, there was a growing sense that medical care was a right — and, with near-miraculous advances in vaccine development, neonatal care, heart surgery, and organ transplantation, to name only a few head spinning changes of the previous decade, there was a growing belief in the life-altering power of medicine. If not every case demanded the same treatment, but every patient had an equal moral claim to dignity, freedom, and individuality, how to bring civil rights into the exam room?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The atomic bomb and Nazi medical experimentation had shown that science — and by extension, medicine — could not be untethered from ethical values, Veatch wrote. Nor would individual autonomy allow for the patient to look up to the doctor as to a priest. The two weren’t colleagues, exactly; that obscured the imbalance in knowledge and power at play. Rather, he suggested, the relationship should be more like a covenant, “a real sharing of decision-making” that harmonizes the patient’s values with the physician’s expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within a decade, federal advisers had taken up the idea. A government commission, initially convened to address research abuses — the Tuskegee study, for instance, in which participants’ syphilis was deliberately left untreated — had expanded its remit to study gnarly clinical questions, such as what constituted death and when to continue or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. They eventually turned to medical decision-making writ large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the 1960s, there was a terribly strong presumption to go off what the doctor said. They were doctor’s orders. People who had cancer were not always told they had cancer,” said geriatrician Joanne Lynn, now retired from a professorship at George Washington University. By the time she became assistant director of the commission, in 1981, “there were a number of court cases that established informed consent, but how to have it work in practice was still in flux.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The old paternalism no longer seemed ethical, but nor did leaving patients to make high-stakes, probability-tangled decisions by themselves. “One of the things we were addressing was the tendency to engage in kind of an information-dumping on the patient,” said Alexander Capron, then the commission’s executive director, now professor emeritus at University of Southern California. “This was partially as a result of regarding informed consent as mostly a protection against liability, and equating informed consent with the consent form.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To the President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, informed consent needed to be more meaningful. Its 1982 report proposed shared decision-making as a possible answer: an in-depth process merging clinician’s know-how and patient’s values. It was neither paternalism nor customer-is-always-right consumerism. Patients couldn’t insist on something that violated the practitioner’s professional standards or morals. This was autonomy buttressed by evidence and clinical acumen. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As shared decision-making became a field unto itself in the ensuing decades, it came to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14706973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;connote &lt;/a&gt;something different from plain old informed consent. Though it might be used as a tool during an informed consent conversation, it was often associated with scenarios in which a clinician saw more than one reasonable option and no obvious standard of care. Informed consent should happen all the time, the patient receiving information and able to ask questions before accepting a treatment. Shared decision-making is informed consent on steroids, honed for the gray areas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A classic example is prostate cancer screening by testing for a biomarker called PSA. Elevated PSA levels might indicate passing inflammation or the presence of cancer. To find out requires invasive testing that carries risk. Even if there is a tumor, it might be something that the patient would die with, rather than die of. Some more aggressive cancers don’t raise one’s PSA; others do. Treating prostate cancer may cause incontinence or sexual dysfunction. Whether to open this can of decisional worms depends on a person’s risk tolerance and how they weigh length versus quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a key difference between such decisions and those surrounding some of the vaccines in question. As Simmons, of Mass General, said, “There’s a societal benefit with vaccination against contagious disease.” You are protected by your neighbors’ immunizations and vice versa. Someone with an immune deficiency whose body can’t mount a response to a shot is kept safer by higher vaccination rates. That’s simply not true of a PSA test or a knee-replacement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cue the post-Covid tension between public health measures and individual liberties. Parents always have the right not to vaccinate their children. A recommendation does not a mandate make — but the federal guidance on vaccines is often used by states for rule-making, requiring kids to be up to date on their shots to attend public school. To scholars of shared decision-making, the Department of Health and Human Services’ usage appeared to be less about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the doctor-patient conversation takes place, more about delegating the decision about whether a vaccine is advisable to each individual: In other words, nudging questions of public health from the public sphere into the private. They worried that the gray-area connotation that surrounded “shared decision-making” made it inappropriate for government guidance in scenarios where routine vaccination was clearly the standard of care. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn’t the first time that federal authorities have used the phrase for vaccines. The expert advisory committee that proposes immunization guidance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention long used two categories: the vaccines you “should” get and others that you “may” get. In 2019, it changed the terminology of the second category for a few adult vaccines to “shared clinical decision-making.” A &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(20)30317-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association described widespread confusion. Some clinicians felt like they’d been left in the lurch, not unlike patients who’ve received an “information-dump” of a consent form with little guidance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Historically, ‘shared decision-making’ was used when there wasn’t a clear population benefit, but they wanted to have the vaccine available for people who wanted it,” said Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz and a committee chair at the American Academy of Pediatrics. “What we saw pretty universally from clinicians is that they hated that kind of recommendation. The response I heard from several folks was: ‘You guys are the experts. If you can’t figure out what the right thing to do is, how are we supposed to do that in a 10-minute office visit?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, though, years after changing the language that surrounds more ambivalent recommendations, federal authorities have essentially switched some vaccines from “should” to “may.” In some instances, the relationship that they seem to promote between Americans and health professionals is adversarial rather than collaborative. “What I would say to people is: Do your own research,” health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said recently on a conservative podcast. “This idea that you should trust the experts — a good mother doesn’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t sound like shared decision-making as articulated by the international society convened to study it. Informed consent should already be happening before any immunization. Pediatricians bristle at the idea that they aren’t already having in-depth conversations with vaccine-hesitant parents every day. In the use of “shared decision-making” as a substitute for guidance, rather than a tool to be used in conjunction with it, researchers fear authorities will spread distrust of a helpful technique — and also of the evidence behind these vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

New research suggests this familiar medication may have effects that go beyond pain relief. Scientists are now examining whether it could also play a role in lowering the risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As research continues to reveal how inflammation contributes to cancer development, ibuprofen has drawn growing attention. Its long-standing role as an anti-inflammatory drug has raised interest in whether a common over-the-counter medicine could offer unexpected protection against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Ibuprofen Works in the Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) family. The connection between NSAIDs and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-prevention-37896"&gt;cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;  isn’t new: as far back as 1983, clinical evidence linked sulindac – an  older prescription NSAID similar to ibuprofen – to a reduced incidence  of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/colon-cancer-4369"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;  in certain patients. Since then, researchers have been investigating  whether these drugs could help prevent or slow other cancers too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547742/"&gt;NSAIDs work&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547742/"&gt;blocking enzymes called cyclooxygenases (COX)&lt;/a&gt;.  There are two main types. COX-1 helps protect the stomach lining,  maintains kidney function, and plays a role in blood clotting. COX-2, on  the other hand, drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit both, which is why doctors  recommend taking them with food rather than on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen and Endometrial Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;A 2025 study&lt;/a&gt;  found that ibuprofen may lower the risk of endometrial cancer, the most  common type of womb cancer, which starts in the lining of the uterus  (the endometrium) and mainly affects women after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest preventable &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/womb-cancer/risks-causes"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;  for endometrial cancer is being overweight or obese, since excess body  fat increases levels of estrogen – a hormone that can stimulate cancer  cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include older age, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; (particularly estrogen-only HRT), diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Early onset of menstruation, late menopause, or not having children also increase risk. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/womb-cancer/symptoms/"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/oncology/news/ibuprofen-emerges-as-protective-factor-against-endometrial-cancer/"&gt;Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study&lt;/a&gt;,  data from more than 42,000 women aged 55–74 was analyzed over 12 years.  Those who reported taking at least 30 ibuprofen tablets per month had a  25% lower risk of developing endometrial cancer than those taking fewer  than four tablets monthly. The protective effect appeared strongest  among women with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, aspirin – another common NSAID – did not show the same association with reduced risk in this or &lt;a href="https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(17)31448-8/abstract"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;. That said, aspirin may help &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;prevent bowel cancer returning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other NSAIDs, such as naproxen, have been studied for preventing &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/2/11/951/47850/Chemopreventive-Efficacy-of-Naproxen-and-Nitric"&gt;colon, bladder, and breast cancers&lt;/a&gt;. The effectiveness of these drugs seems to depend on cancer type, genetics, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ibuprofen’s Broader Potential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that ibuprofen’s possible benefits may extend beyond endometrial cancer. Research has linked its use to a lower risk of bowel, breast, lung, and prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, people who &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6188"&gt;previously had bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; and took ibuprofen were less likely to experience recurrence. It has also been shown to &lt;a href="https://mbrc.shirazu.ac.ir/article_6973.html"&gt;inhibit colon cancer growth and survival&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2017.1239"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; even suggests a protective effect against lung cancer in smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and ibuprofen is, at its core, anti-inflammatory. By blocking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047847714002433?via%3Dihub"&gt;COX-2 enzyme activity&lt;/a&gt;, the drug reduces production of prostaglandins, chemical messengers that drive inflammation and cell growth – including &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/6/1487"&gt;cancer cell growth&lt;/a&gt;. Lower prostaglandin levels may slow or stop tumour development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s only part of the story. Ibuprofen also appears to influence cancer-related genes such as &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323635"&gt;HIF-1α, NFκB, and STAT3&lt;/a&gt;, which help tumor cells survive in low-oxygen conditions and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen seems to reduce the activity of these genes, making cancer cells more vulnerable. It can also alter how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-020-0906-7"&gt;DNA is packaged within cells&lt;/a&gt;, potentially making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Word of Caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all research points in the same direction. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.35363"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;  involving 7,751 patients found that taking aspirin after an endometrial  cancer diagnosis was linked to higher mortality, particularly among  those who had used aspirin before diagnosis. Other NSAIDs also appeared  to increase cancer-related death risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)10411-7?uuid=uuid%3A36697d88-ee94-4d3c-8754-db42e17bde1b"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;  found that NSAIDs, especially aspirin, may reduce the risk of several  cancers – though regular use of other NSAIDs could raise the risk of  kidney cancer. These conflicting results show how complex the  interaction between inflammation, immunity, and cancer really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise, experts warn against self-medicating with  ibuprofen for cancer prevention. Long-term or high-dose NSAID use can  cause serious &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nsaids-prescribing-issues/management/nsaids-prescribing-issues/#:%7E:text=Cardiovascular%20and%20renal%20complications%20are,cardiac%20or%20renal%20adverse%20events."&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach ulcers, gut bleeding, and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less commonly, they may trigger &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5422108/"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart attacks or strokes. NSAIDs also interact with several medications, including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-199630060-00002"&gt;warfarin&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/18/7/1062"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the risk of bleeding and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a humble painkiller could help prevent cancer is both  exciting and provocative. If future studies confirm these findings,  ibuprofen might one day form part of a broader strategy for reducing  cancer risk, especially in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, experts agree it’s wiser to focus on lifestyle-based prevention: eating anti-inflammatory foods, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine/patient/endometrial-prevention-pdq#:%7E:text=of%20endometrial%20cancer.-,The%20following%20protective%20factors%20decrease%20the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer,the%20risk%20of%20endometrial%20cancer."&gt;maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday medicines may still hold unexpected potential, but until the science is settled, the most reliable advice remains simple: eat well, stay active, and talk with your doctor before relying on any medication for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

Rob and Julia Campbell/Stocksy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we age, our strength and mobility decrease, largely due to muscle loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise, particularly resistance training, is widely recommended to help maintain muscle mass during aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, a study has discovered how exercise acts at a molecular level to prevent muscle loss as we get older.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have found that exercise restores muscle growth by inhibiting a pathway that leads to muscle deterioration and activating proteins that encourage repair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;span&gt;age 30, a person’s muscle mass decreases by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;3-8% per decade&lt;/a&gt;, and this decline accelerates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; after age &lt;/span&gt;60. Although muscle loss cannot be prevented entirely, we know that an active lifestyle, including strength training, can slow the decline and increase muscle strength, helping people remain mobile and independent for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have uncovered the molecular pathway that explains how exercise helps us maintain muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508893122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, found that exercise suppresses a transcription factor, DEAF1, that drives protein imbalance and muscle decline, helping muscles to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe our findings are important because they uncover a previously unknown biological mechanism that helps explain why muscles weaken with age. While it has long been known that exercise protects muscle health, the molecular reasons behind this benefit were not fully understood. Our study identifies DEAF1 as a key driver of age-related muscle decline and shows that exercise can directly suppress this pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://www.sgh.com.sg/pgmi/annual-scientific-meeting/asst-prof-tang-hong-wen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Tang Hong-Wen&lt;/a&gt;, Corresponding Author, Assistant Professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebnem Unluisler, genetic engineer at the &lt;a href="https://london-regenerative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;London Regenerative Institute&lt;/a&gt;, who wasn’t involved in the study, called the study highly significant, telling &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows that aging shifts muscle protein regulation away from repair toward accumulation, which is a core driver of muscle decline. The transcription factor DEAF1 increases with age and suppresses the cell’s ability to clear damaged proteins, leaving muscle tissue less resilient and more fragile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers &lt;span&gt;examined a pathway controlled by the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5545101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;mTORC1 complex&lt;/a&gt;, which links nutrient signals to the metabolic processes required&lt;/span&gt; for cell growth. They knew that hyperactivation of mTORC1 leads to age-related muscle loss, but wanted to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they used fruit fly and mouse models to investigate what was controlling mTORC1, discovering that a protein, DEAF1, was key. Although DEAF1 is present in both young and older muscles, aging muscles are much more sensitive to its effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tang Hong-Wen told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As we get older, our muscle cells slowly lose their ability to clear away damaged proteins and repair themselves. We discovered that a protein called DEAF1 becomes more active in aging muscle and drives another system, mTOR, into overdrive. This makes muscle cells focus too much on growth and not enough on maintenance and repair, which gradually leads to muscle weakness.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise turns on protective ‘longevity’ genes called FOXO, which act like a brake on DEAF1. When DEAF1 is switched down, muscle cells regain their ability to recycle damaged parts and stay healthy. In simple terms, exercise helps restore balance inside muscle cells and keeps muscles stronger for longer,” Tang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both DEAF1 and mTORC1 regulate protein synthesis, autophagy (cell recycling), and metabolism. The researchers found that aging muscle is more sensitive to DEAF1 than younger muscle, so it loses its ability to clear damaged proteins and cellular components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By exercising, you can activate FOXO genes, which regulate DEAF1, allowing the muscle to clear damaged material and focus on producing the proteins needed for muscle repair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise counteracts [muscle decline] by down-regulating DEAF1 and re-activating cellular repair and quality-control mechanisms. In simple terms, exercise restores the muscle cell’s ability to fix itself rather than just produce new material. Resistance-based exercise is likely the most effective, as it provides the strongest molecular stimulus for repair, adaptation, and long-term maintenance of muscle integrity during aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Sebnem Unluisler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that different exercises have different effects, but that any exercise can help to preserve and strengthen muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acute or resistance exercise, such as weight training, stimulates mTORC1 to promote muscle protein synthesis, whereas aerobic activity, such as brisk walking or cycling, suppresses the pathway by activating FOXO, which represses DEAF1 and prevents muscle degeneration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that both aerobic (endurance) exercise and resistance (strength) training are beneficial for muscle health. Each type of exercise activates the body’s protective FOXO pathway in slightly different ways, and doing a combination of both is likely to provide the greatest benefit. In practical terms, regular physical activity — such as brisk walking, cycling, swimming, along with light weight or bodyweight training — can play an important role in maintaining strong, healthy muscles as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Tang Hong-Wen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One encouraging message from our study,” says Tan, “is that it is never too late to benefit from exercise. Even in older muscle, this protective pathway can still be switched on. We hope our findings will motivate more people to stay active and also help guide the development of new treatments that support healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our work also highlights that muscle aging is not simply about losing muscle mass, but about losing the ability to maintain healthy muscle,” he told us. “By identifying DEAF1 as a central regulator of this process, we aim to inspire new strategies — including both exercise-based and medical approaches — to help older adults remain stronger, more mobile, and more independent for longer.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even if you do not exercise much at present, introducing more activity into your daily routine at any age can help you preserve that vital muscle as you age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:27:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQdEVKR2xtOUtiMVpNNlp1a2ZhUHBMbk91RFFWc1V4N0Jza2otRlVaMXVkNXFtWEYta1EybGJoOUMwUDU3b2o5WHpab1Z4ejdXOGZGamVVR19FVGI0WDdiazdGWC1oS3UzUDV5QXdpTmxxWEtScnlSQWRpSjA0am0zdkYzM2hnYUVPejkwLWlvcFNCMnZnaGNwdzdoWVRfUQ</guid></item><item><title>想睡得更好吗？按照专家的建议，通过这五种简单的生活方式改变来改善您的肠道健康- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/sleep/want-to-sleep-better-improve-your-gut-health-with-these-five-easy-lifestyle-changes-as-recommended-by-an-expert</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;p id="8d56c591-083e-45d7-a261-a9daa8c5ef77"&gt;Can’t sleep? Or do you find yourself constantly waking up at night? The answer to getting a good night’s sleep could actually be linked to what’s going on in your digestive system. Gut health and sleep are bedfellows—and if you can improve one, the other will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because gut microbes don’t just digest the food we eat, explains Dr Manal Mohammed, a senior lecturer in Medical Microbiology at the University of Westminster in London: “A healthy gut microbiome supports better sleep by producing sleep-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and melatonin, reducing inflammation and modulating stress hormones,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8d56c591-083e-45d7-a261-a9daa8c5ef77-2"&gt;“When the gut is happy, this also promotes the production of calming chemicals in the body like GABA, and helps maintain circadian rhythms [the body’s internal clock]. Together, these effects contribute to deeper, more restorative and consistent sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can you improve your gut health? Mohammed has a five-step guide. Here’s what she recommends to ultimately help you towards a better night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-keep-consistent-meal-times" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-keep-consistent-meal-times"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Keep consistent meal times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b182ba1f-cb5a-4404-87ef-0c855a912aeb"&gt;Like the body’s circadian rhythm, the digestive system has its own internal clock that helps the gut maintain a steady daily flow. Studies have found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488812/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488812/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;erratic meal-times&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/nutrition/eating-too-late-could-wreck-your-sleep-muscle-recovery-and-impact-weight-gain-why-this-expert-recommends-an-early-dinner" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/nutrition/eating-too-late-could-wreck-your-sleep-muscle-recovery-and-impact-weight-gain-why-this-expert-recommends-an-early-dinner"&gt;eating too close to bedtime&lt;/a&gt; plays havoc with microbes because it interferes with nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Mohammed explains that “predictable eating patterns reduce inflammation, stabilize blood sugar and enhance the production of SCFAs [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498509/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498509/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;short-chain fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;], which are important for strengthening the gut lining and supporting the gut-brain axis. Overall, regular meal timing helps maintain a balanced, diverse and healthy gut microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-eat-foods-rich-in-prebiotics-and-probiotics" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-eat-foods-rich-in-prebiotics-and-probiotics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Eat foods rich in prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b11e42cd-7113-4d39-9586-a2a7d263ccef"&gt;Prebiotics are widely available in fiber-rich foods, while probiotics can be found in some fermented foods, or for larger quantities through supplementation. The two work together to keep the gut happy and this can have the knock on effect of better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4iNbA9mpegH8HAi3PBoSMR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4iNbA9mpegH8HAi3PBoSMR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probiotics provide beneficial live bacteria for the gut: found in foods such as kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and miso,” Mohammed tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well.&lt;/em&gt; “Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible fibers that serve as food for these beneficial bacteria and they are found in foods like garlic, onions, leeks, bananas, oats, asparagus and chicory root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probiotics help introduce and support healthy gut microbes, while prebiotics help them survive, grow and thrive. They support a healthy gut microbiome by working together to promote beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This synergy enhances microbial diversity and boosts SCFA production such as butyrate, which strengthens the gut barrier and supports digestion, immunity and gut–brain communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-cut-back-on-sugar-and-ultra-processed-foods-upfs" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-cut-back-on-sugar-and-ultra-processed-foods-upfs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Cut back on sugar and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="865f111b-5fb9-475b-b3e0-45692561772f"&gt;Sugary and UPFs—such as sodas, cereals and ready meals—are highly inflammatory, they irritate and weaken the gut lining by reducing microbial diversity and spiking blood sugar levels. UPFs are often low in fiber and high in additives, like emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, which suppress fiber-fermenting bacteria—negatively impacting gut health, and therefore sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed explains that when you cut back on these nutrient-deficient foods it “allows beneficial microbes such as &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; to thrive, while stabilizing blood sugar and inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends swapping sugary products and UPFs for whole foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. “This will increase the amount of prebiotic fiber in the body, boosting the production of SCFAs to strengthen the gut barrier, regulate immune function, support gut–brain communication and reduce inflammation—creating an environment where a healthy and diverse gut microbiome can flourish,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-try-to-reduce-stress" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-try-to-reduce-stress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Try to reduce stress &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="58aeec68-eb4a-40cc-93d9-4bc396fb8334"&gt;This one might be easier said than done, but stress levels can really play havoc with the gut and sleep. Stress floods the body with the hormone cortisol, leading to an increase in inflammation in the body and a weaker gut lining. When you are less stressed, your digestion can work more efficiently and this helps to maintain a “balanced and resilient gut ecosystem”, says Mohammed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing stress levels can be tricky but breathwork and exercise can help, as can taking time away from social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-stay-well-hydrated" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-stay-well-hydrated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Stay well hydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b06cd1bc-0f95-4a94-aaaa-11af4c1da4b6"&gt;There are so many ways in which drinking a healthy amount of water is beneficial for your gut. Water supports the breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients and helps lubricate the digestive tract to help with the removal of waste—promoting regular bowel movements. It also supports a healthy gut microbiome and immune function. A happy, more stable gut environment means you are more likely to have a deeper and restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

My go-to remedy is usually a coffee and cold-water face plunge, followed by a compulsive phone scroll. But today called for something more, so I unpeeled a small, yellow “energy” patch the size of a walnut, popped it on to my upper arm and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patch (£12 for 30) contains – so the packaging says – vitamins B5, B3 and a “microdose” of caffeine. It is made by Kind Patches, which is one brand in an increasingly crowded market of wellness stickers that claim to treat everything from lack of sleep to period pains to pimples. They are coin-sized, and often come in TikTok-friendly shades of sunflower yellow and peachy orange: you may have seen a teenager sporting a star-shaped one on their face to treat spots, or influencers patting blue magnesium ones on their wrists before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These patches are designed to deliver various substances into the bloodstream through the skin – to ward off some of the most common symptoms of everyday life. Feeling tired? Patches. Feeling stressed? Patches. Feeling anxious? Patches. From libido boosters to immunity enhancers, there’s a patch for every condition if you look hard enough. The wearable patch market – which also includes disease monitoring and drug delivery – was estimated at &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ebdee6d-eee0-4ed9-a7e2-7547bd1f03c9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$9.95bn in 2024&lt;/a&gt; (approx £7.45bn) and is predicted to grow significantly in the next five years, according to the Financial Times. Forget eating your feelings; pop a sticker on them instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="89c65e0d-f726-4cb8-ad45-cf40b21e432f" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Star patches for acne and pimples are the accessory of choice for gen Z.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But do they work? Or are they yet more snake oil in the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/global-wellness-industry-is-now-worth-6-3-trillion" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$6tn global wellness industry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;designed to exploit our weaknesses, on the basis that those most human of conditions – how well you sleep, how happy you are – are there to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Tregoning, professor of vaccine immunology at Imperial College London and author of the book &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/live-forever-9780861549382/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Live Forever?&lt;/a&gt;, says it is impossible to know. “It’s not like a vaccine where you did or didn’t get the virus. It is: do you feel better?” For example, the energy patch I’m wearing now may make me feel better. “But my take on energy might be different to yours,” Tregoning points out. If nothing else, he says, patches like the ones I am sampling “are an example of drifting placebo. Simply by putting it on, it might get you out of a slump”. It’s also nigh-on impossible to prove which ones don’t work if you can’t prove which ones do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You cannot feel these patches , and they slide off easily in the bath. But you can certainly see them, which for some users is half the point. Depending on where you place the patch – guidance varies, but most suggest the neck and chest areas to see which makes a difference – they are often as visible as you need them to be. Some claim to work the same day, while others suggest using them for up to a month. The effects of the energy patch I am wearing are supposed to be instant. I can’t say I feel anything that morning, but by the time I peel it off in the bath, I do believe I feel fresher. The idea is neat. But is it the patch? I also did some yoga, and had steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I try another energy patch by The What Supp Co (£18 for 15 patches), which it says is for “fatigue, fed-up feelings and focus”. It contains ashwagandha (which it &lt;a href="https://thewhatsupp.com/products/protect-your-energy-vitamin-patches" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; “helps your body adapt to stress”) and caffeine among a list of other ingredients. I pop the red W-shaped patch on my wrist, as shown in the instruction video. I don’t know if it is doing anything, but I do struggle to get to sleep that night, which is debatably down to the caffeine (luckily I have a patch for sleep too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Acupuncturist Ross J Barr also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/focus-patches?variant=55856746627452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; that promises to support “focus, clarity and mental performance” (£15 for 10). Less visible than most, it smells herbal, a little festive, which is the point – it apparently offers a “deeply relaxing olfactive experience”&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;I could also feel it when I put the patch on – a gentle tingling, not unlike a Tens machine, which did at least make me believe it was doing something. I also try Barr’s &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/period-patches?variant=44601291374756" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Period Patches&lt;/a&gt; for cramps, aches and pains (£15 for seven), which were developed with gynaecological staff at Miss Claire Mellon &amp;amp; Associates private practice. Like Barr’s other patch, it smells strongly of essential oils – somewhere between a meadow and tobacco – which is also the point. The sticker is stickier, and even after six hours it’s hard to remove. It is also designed to fit very specifically at the base of the spine. I don’t know how much this played into what happened next – but something did. My cramps seemed to mellow. Whether this was better than taking a painkiller, I couldn’t say. But the patches certainly cost more than over-the-counter painkillers – a factor that Dr Deborah Cohen, author of the new book Bad Influence: How the Internet Hijacked Our Health, thinks might influence how well they work. “The more expensive something is, the more you expect it to work,” she says. Cohen thinks women’s health has been neglected for too long, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;these patches expose broader problems in the healthcare system too. “One of the reasons we go to social media to solve our problems is because doctors can’t give that level of holistic care,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="60e35233-9643-491c-b91b-78c873e8cea5" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ross J Barr Focus Patches.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ross J Barr&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eleven days into my patch journey, I have tried one for sleep and one for dreaming (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for 10, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kind, £12 for 30); two for focus (Kind, £12 for 30, and Ross J Barr, £15 for 10), one for energy (Kind, £12 for 30), one for chilling out (The What Supp Co, £18 for 15), and another for menstrual cramps (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for seven). I’d love to say their collective effect was seismic, but aside from feeling a little buzzy after wearing those containing caffeine and the aforementioned effects of Barr’s cramp patches, I can’t be sure that I felt &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s not to say they didn’t work. The science behind patches is at best nebulous and at worse absent, but as you can’t control the variables, it’s impossible to know if it’s the patch – or something else. “Reducing something to, say, one hormone is a very reductionist way of looking at our health,” says Cohen. “We need to be more holistic and look at the whole person before we work out how to treat something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inevitably some of these patches have taken a more sinister turn towards diet culture. Berberine, a plant-derived compound, is believed to suppress appetite. I try Kind’s berberine patches (which curiously changed their name from Weightless); they need to be worn every day to see a difference. When I go out for a walk, I have to turn back as I start feeling light-headed. I quickly take it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m struck that only one of the patches I try comes with the caveat that they are not the only solution to a problem. Alongside using Barr’s sleep patches, for example, it is recommended that other basic sleep hygiene practices are brought in – read a book, turn off your phone, etc. While there may not be anything specifically wrong with putting on a patch if you can afford it, they are not a panacea. As Tregoning points out, it’s probably best to see them “like an expensive herbal tea”. Drink it if you like it and think it helps, but it’s not a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But then this is the problem with a lot of the products in the wellness space – everyone is looking for a hack, a quick fix. It is easier to put a sleep patch on than contemplate that poor sleep may be a logical response to the modern world; that a lack of energy may be due to an overwhelming life; that a lack of focus may mean you are dealing with bigger problems than the day-to-day of going to work. In an age in which we have learned to manipulate the aesthetics of our bodies through surgery or fillers, it seems highly appropriate that we might also now wear our supplements. As Cohen writes in her book, “the body is now a dashboard to be monitored and gamified”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec98b8d3-2cd1-4d0d-8d35-87523ca15e67" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And of course, this is performative health. When I failed to give up smoking, my nicotine patch was proof to the outside world that I was at least trying. Lisa Payne, head of beauty at trend forecaster company Stylus, calls it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“handbag health” – the idea that you can carry around patches and pop them on when you need a lift. “These patches cost money, so it literally shows you have invested in your health.” Forget eating your feelings; pop a plaster on them instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The use of patches in medicine is nothing new, says Pupinder Ghatora, a pharmacist and co-founder of a collagen supplement brand. “In pharmaceuticals, we’ve used patches for pain relief, anti-sickness medications, certain heart treatments and nicotine-replacement therapy. These medicines are clinically proven as the molecule is suitable for skin absorption and the formulation is designed with this in mind.” However, the evidence on wellness patches for other purposes is less clear. “Transdermal delivery can absolutely be effective but only when the science supports it. The skin barrier is incredibly sophisticated and not every ingredient can pass through it,” Ghatora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The problem, adds Cohen, isn’t just the way these substances are delivered – it’s the substances themselves. “Before you get to the ‘route’, the first thing to ask is whether the compound they’re promoting is going to do anything.” Take something like dopamine, she says, for which patches do exist. This needs to go into your brain to work. How does that even happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HRT patches and nicotine patches [which have been around for a while] require robust clinical trials to prove they have an effect. But if you can spin something into a wellness supplement, you don’t need regulators,” she says. “Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Perhaps the most ubiquitous patches are Star patches. If you have a teenager – or watched last year’s Big Brother – there is every chance you’ve come across them. Designed to protect spots from bacteria and prevent picking, while also containing various ingredients which may or may not treat the spot, they have become such a mainstay of modern culture that the V&amp;amp;A recently acquired some in its &lt;a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/rapid-response-collecting?srsltid=AfmBOoqFisrHBGVBj0Q5Zwa6ZkuqzU81v9_Y_vLnMhq1-Dt0TWJ0UKHl" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rapid Response Collecting&lt;/a&gt; as an example of gen Z lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b04ec8d4-65f9-4d3f-aef7-ea12d840ae31" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kind’s Berberine metabolic balance patch.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Kind Patches&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advertising that you have a pimple is a million miles away from how millennials like me and Payne grew up. “Our generation saw beauty as something that solves the problem you want to fix,” she says. If you had a spot, you’d buy concealer to hide it, not a neon sticker to broadcast it as a shared experience. But for some of gen Z, Payne says, a visible treatment for an internal feeling is as much about identity as anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It used to be easy to be good. All you had to do was combine a decent diet, exercise, time outside and connection with friends. Now, says Cohen, “daily life is subjected to medical interpretation and diagnosis, with normal variations reframed as conditions requiring intervention”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I spent three weeks patched up, on and off. And some people I know swear by Barr’s sleep patches. But it was also deep, dark December, a time when my moods and sleep shift like sand, and as a newish millennial parent, it was ever thus. Patches are an example of the way influencer culture has scrambled how we look at ourselves. But if you’re tired and there’s no other underlying problem causing it, the likelihood is you probably need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQZ0QzX0RELUZCc2lrOW8zMVp6R0k2S1NJRG1uaVJnbVUtanQ4X1pPdWp1TWFCOUZ3clJOUTRSbE55RzNxUFFMRERQOWZQb1FPSHRac3F0SzNpTzNLZkZSLUpRbHpKV2xPdDJ1ZnNEaDVZa0FmaTRHMGdDUmc2ZzRwajZydWllaHdfOFV5RkpmRHdQcXlVNG5SX1g5aTVkd3pDMXhQUklZWkU3aWY3NGZBRlpLaVlJM2l5X2NmQm9YdVo</guid></item><item><title>医生说， “每天只需几分钟”就可以改善平衡并降低跌倒的风险- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/a-doctor-says-all-it-takes-is-a-few-intentional-minutes-a-day-to-improve-balance-and-reduce-your-risk-of-falls</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
